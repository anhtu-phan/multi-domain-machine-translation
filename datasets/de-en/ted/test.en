But in 2002, when my tour came to an end, I decided I wasn't going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in London.
I decided to take a sabbatical, in fact, at the New School, Bruce.
In some inchoate, inarticulate way I realized that there was something wrong with my work, with me.
I was exhausted, and I was also disillusioned in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on.
And I decided to take some time out from work.
The Foreign Office was very generous.
You could take these special unpaid leave, as they called them, and yet remain part of the diplomatic service, but not actually do any work.
It was nice.
And eventually, I decided to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo, which was then under U.N. administration.
And two things happened in Kosovo, which kind of, again, shows the randomness of life, because these things turned out to be two of the pivots of my life and helped to deliver me to the next stage.
But they were random things.
One was that, in the summer of 2004, the British government, somewhat reluctantly, decided to have an official inquiry into the use of intelligence on WMD in the run up to the Iraq War, a very limited subject.
And I testified to that inquiry in secret.
I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq and its WMD, and my testimony to the inquiry said three things: that the government exaggerated the intelligence, which was very clear in all the years I'd read it.
And indeed, our own internal assessment was very clear that Iraq's WMD did not pose a threat to its neighbors, let alone to us.
Secondly, the government had ignored all available alternatives to war, which in some ways was a more discreditable thing still.
The third reason, I won't go into.
But anyway, I gave that testimony, and that presented me with a crisis.
What was I going to do?
This testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues, of my ministers, who had, in my view had perpetrated a war on a falsehood.
And so I was in crisis.
And this wasn't a pretty thing.
I moaned about it, I hesitated, I went on and on and on to my long-suffering wife, and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service.
I felt -- there's a scene in the Al Pacino movie "The Insider," which you may know, where he goes back to CBS after they've let him down over the tobacco guy, and he goes, "You know, I just can't do this anymore. Something's broken."
And it was like that for me. I love that movie.
I felt just something's broken.
I can't actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a smile on my face and do what I used to do gladly for them.
So took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff.
And it was a very, very uncomfortable, unpleasant feeling.
And I started to fall.
And today, that fall hasn't stopped; I'm still falling.
But, in a way, I've got used to the sensation of it.
And in a way, I kind of like the sensation of it a lot better than I like actually standing on top of the cliff, wondering what to do.
A second thing happened in Kosovo, which kind of -- I need a quick gulp of water, forgive me.
A second thing happened in Kosovo, which kind of delivered the answer, which I couldn't really answer, which is, "What do I do with my life?"
I love diplomacy -- I have no career -- I expected my entire life to be a diplomat, to be serving my country.
I wanted to be an ambassador, and my mentors, my heroes, people who got to the top of my profession, and here I was throwing it all away.
A lot of my friends were still in it.
My pension was in it.
And I gave it up.
And what was I going to do?
And that year, in Kosovo, this terrible, terrible thing happened, which I saw.
In March 2004, there were terrible riots all over the province -- as it then was -- of Kosovo.
18 people were killed.
It was anarchy.
And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy, to know that the police and the military -- there were lots of military troops there -- actually can't stop that rampaging mob who's coming down the street.
And the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop is when they decide to stop and when they've had enough burning and killing.
And that is not a very nice feeling to see, and I saw it.
And I went through it. I went through those mobs.
And with my Albanian friends, we tried to stop it, but we failed.
And that riot taught me something, which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story.
But one of the reasons that riot took place -- those riots, which went on for several days, took place -- was because the Kosovo people were disenfranchised from their own future.
There were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo going on then, and the Kosovo government, let alone the Kosovo people, were not actually participating in those talks.
There was this whole fancy diplomatic system, this negotiation process about the future of Kosovo, and the Kosovars weren't part of it.
And funnily enough, they were frustrated about that.
Those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration.
It wasn't the only reason, and life is not simple, one reason narratives.
It was a complicated thing, and I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was.
But that was one of the reasons.
And that kind of gave me the inspiration -- or rather to be precise, it gave my wife the inspiration.
She said, "Why don't you advise the Kosovars?
Why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy?"
And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service.
They were not allowed diplomats.
They were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process, which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo.
And so that was the idea.
That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat, the world's first diplomatic advisory group and a non-profit to boot.
And it began when I flew back from London after my time at the U.N. in Kosovo.
I flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him, "Look, I'm proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy.
I know this stuff. It's what I do. Why don't I come and help you?"
And he raised his glass of raki to me and said, "Yes, Carne. Come."
And I came to Kosovo and advised the Kosovo government.
Independent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers and the multi-party negotiation team of Kosovo.
And Kosovo became independent.
Independent Diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world, and we're advising seven or eight different countries, or political groups, depending on how you wish to define them -- and I'm not big on definitions.
We're advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island.
We're advising the Burmese opposition, the government of Southern Sudan, which -- you heard it here first -- is going to be a new country within the next few years.
We're advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara, who are fighting to get their country back from Moroccan occupation after 34 years of dispossession.
We're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations, which is suppose to culminate in Copenhagen.
There's a bit of randomness here too because, when I was beginning Independent Diplomat, I went to a party in the House of Lords, which is a ridiculous place, but I was holding my drink like this, and I bumped into this guy who was standing behind me.
And we started talking, and he said -- I told him what I was doing, and I told him rather grandly I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York.
At that time there was just me -- and me and my wife were moving back to New York.
And he said, "Why don't you see my colleagues in New York?"
And it turned out he worked for an innovation company called ?What If!, which some of you have probably heard of.
And one thing led to another, and I ended up having a desk in ?What If! in New York, when I started Independent Diplomat.
And watching ?What If!
develop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley or new flavors for Coke actually helped me innovate new strategies for the Kosovars and for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara.
And I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy -- that diplomacy, like business, is a business of solving problems, and yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy; it's all zero sum games and realpolitik and ancient institutions that have been there for generations and do things the same way they've always done things.
And Independent Diplomat, today, tries to incorporate some of the things I learned at ?What If!.
We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office.
We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think.
And we use naive experts who may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with, but may know something about something else to try to inject new thinking into the problems that we try to address for our clients.
It's not easy, because our clients, by definition, are having a difficult time, diplomatically.
There are, I don't know, some lessons from all of this, personal and political -- and in a way, they're the same thing.
The personal one is falling off a cliff is actually a good thing, and I recommend it.
And it's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump.
The second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today.
Independent Diplomat is part of a trend which is emerging and evident across the world, which is that the world is fragmenting.
States mean less than they used to, and the power of the state is declining.
That means the power of others things is rising.
Those other things are called non-state actors.
They may be corporations, they may be mafiosi, they may be nice NGOs, they may anything, any number of things.
We are living in a more complicated and fragmented world.
If governments are less able to affect the problems that affect us in the world, then that means, who is left to deal with them, who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them?
Us.
If they can't do it, who's left to deal with it?
We have no choice but to embrace that reality.
What this means is it's no longer good enough to say that international relations, or global affairs, or chaos in Somalia, or what's going on in Burma is none of your business, and that you can leave it to governments to get on with.
I can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the Al-Shabaab militia in Somalia.
Ask me how later, particularly if you eat fish, interestingly enough, but that connection is there.
We are all intimately connected.
And this isn't just Tom Friedman, it's actually provable in case after case after case.
What that means is, instead of asking your politicians to do things, you have to look to yourself to do things.
And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this in a sort of loose way.
There aren't neat examples, but one example is this: the way the world is changing is embodied in what's going on at the place I used to work -- the U.N. Security Council.
The U.N. was established in 1945.
Its charter is basically designed to stop conflicts between states -- interstate conflict.
Today, 80 percent of the agenda of the U.N. Security Council is about conflicts within states, involving non-state parties -- guerillas, separatists, terrorists, if you want to call them that, people who are not normal governments, who are not normal states.
That is the state of the world today.
When I realized this, and when I look back on my time at the Security Council and what happened with the Kosovars, and I realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the Security Council weren't actually there, weren't actually invited to give their views to the Security Council, I thought, this is wrong.
Something's got to be done about this.
So I started off in a traditional mode.
Me and my colleagues at Independent Diplomat went around the U.N. Security Council.
We went around 70 U.N. member states -- the Kazaks, the Ethiopians, the Israelis -- you name them, we went to see them -- the secretary general, all of them, and said, "This is all wrong.
This is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected.
You've got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the Kosovars to come and tell you what they think.
This will allow you to tell me -- you can tell them what you think.
It'll be great. You can have an exchange.
You can actually incorporate these people's views into your decisions, which means your decisions will be more effective and durable."
Super-logical, you would think.
I mean, incredibly logical. So obvious, anybody could get it.
And of course, everybody got it. Everybody went, "Yes, of course, you're absolutely right.
Come back to us in maybe six months."
And of course, nothing happened -- nobody did anything.
The Security Council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did X number of years ago, when I was there 10 years ago.
So we looked at that observation of basically failure and thought, what can we do about it.
And I thought, I'm buggered if I'm going to spend the rest of my life lobbying for these crummy governments to do what needs to be done.
So what we're going to do is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves.
So now, Independent Diplomat is in the process of setting up meetings between the U.N. Security Council and the parties to the disputes that are on the agenda of the Security Council.
So we will be bringing Darfuri rebel groups, the Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots, rebels from Aceh, and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world.
And we will be trying to bring the parties to New York to sit down in a quiet room in a private setting with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the U. N. Security Council, and for the members of the U.N. Security Council to explain to them what they want.
So there's actually a conversation, which has never before happened.
And of course, describing all this, any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult, and I entirely agree with you.
The chances of failure are very high, but it certainly won't happen if we don't try to make it happen.
And my politics has changed fundamentally from when I was a diplomat to what I am today, and I think that outputs is what matters, not process, not technology, frankly, so much either.
Preach technology to all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations who are now in political prison in Tehran, where Ahmadinejad remains in power.
Technology has not delivered political change in Iran.
You've got to look at the outputs, and you got to say to yourself, "What can I do to produce that particular output?"
That is the politics of the 21st century, and in a way, Independent Diplomat embodies that fragmentation, that change, that is happening to all of us.
That's my story. Thanks.

<title>Carne Ross: An independent diplomat</title>
<description>After 15 years in the British diplomatic corps, Carne Ross became a "freelance diplomat," running a bold nonprofit that gives small, developing and yet-unrecognized nations a voice in international relations. At the BIF-5 conference, he calls for a new kind of diplomacy that gives voice to small countries, that works with changing boundaries and that welcomes innovation.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/renny_gleeson_404_the_story_of_a_page_not_found.html</url>
So what I want to try to do is tell a quick story about a 404 page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it.
But to start it probably helps to have an understanding of what a 404 page actually is.
The 404 page is that.
It's that broken experience on the Web.
It's effectively the default page when you ask a website for something and it can't find it.
And it serves you the 404 page.
It's inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it.
And I just want you to think a little bit about, remember for yourself, it's annoying when you hit this thing.
Because it's the feeling of a broken relationship.
And that's where it's actually also interesting to think about, where does 404 come from?
It's from a family of errors actually -- a whole set of relationship errors, which, when I started digging into them, it looks almost like a checklist for a sex therapist or a couples couselor.
You sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey.
Yes.
But these things are everywhere.
They're on sites big, they're on sites small.
This is a global experience.
What a 404 page tells you is that you fell through the cracks.
And that's not a good experience when you're used to experiences like this.
You can get on your Kinect and you can have unicorns dancing and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone.
A 404 page is not what you're looking for.
You get that, and it's like a slap in the face.
Trying to think about how a 404 felt, and it would be like if you went to Starbucks and there's the guy behind the counter and you're over there and there's no skim milk.
And you say, "Hey, could you bring the skim milk?"
And they walk out from behind the counter and they've got no pants on.
And you're like, "Oh, I didn't want to see that."
That's the 404 feeling.
I mean, I've heard about that.
So where this comes into play and why this is important is I head up a technology incubator, and we had eight startups sitting around there.
And those startups are focused on what they are, not what they're not, until one day Athletepath, which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes, found this video.
Joey!
Crowd: Whoa!
Renny Gleeson: You just ... no, he's not okay.
They took that video and they embedded it in their 404 page and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place.
Because finally there was a page that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a 404.
So this turned into a contest.
Dailypath that offers inspiration put inspiration on their 404 page.
Stayhound, which helps you find pet sitters through your social network, commiserated with your pet.
Each one of them found this.
It turned into a 24-hour contest.
At 4:04 the next day, we gave out $404 in cash.
And what they learned was that those little things, done right, actually matter, and that well-designed moments can build brands.
So you take a look out in the real world, and the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself.
You can type in an URL and put in a 404 and these will pop.
This is one that commiserates with you.
This is one that blames you.
This is one that I loved.
This is an error page, but what if this error page was also an opportunity?
So it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think and got really excited about what they could be.
Because back to the whole relationship issue, what they figured out through this exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you're not, or it can remind me of why I should love you.
Thank you.

<description>Oops! Nobody wants to see the 404: Page Not Found. But as Renny Gleeson shows us, while he runs through a slideshow of creative and funny 404 pages, every error is really a chance to build a better relationship.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/lauren_zalaznick.html</url>
I want to say that really and truly, after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread, I am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about television.
So most everyone watches TV.
We like it. We like some parts of it.
Here in America, people actually love TV.
The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day.
Okay?
Now I happen to make my living these days in television, so for me, that's a good thing.
But a lot of people don't love it so much.
They, in fact, berate it.
They call it stupid, and worse, believe me.
My mother, growing up, she called it the "idiot box."
But my idea today is not to debate whether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience.
So why I believe that television has a conscience is that I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral, political, social and emotional need states of our nation -- that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system.
So all these things are uniquely human, and they all add up to our idea of conscience.
Now today, we're not talking about good and bad TV.
We're talking about popular TV.
We're talking about top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over the course of 50 years.
How do these Nielsen ratings reflect not just what you've heard about, which is the idea of our social, collective unconscious, but how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over 50 years reflect the idea How does television evolve over time, and what does this say about our society?
Now speaking of evolution, from basic biology, you probably remember that the animal kingdom, including humans, have four basic primal instincts.
You have hunger; you have sex; you have power; and you have the urge for acquisitiveness.
As humans, what's important to remember is that we've developed, we've evolved over time to temper, or tame, these basic animal instincts.
We have the capacity to laugh and cry.
We feel awe, we feel pity.
That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom.
The other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained.
We love to watch TV.
This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom.
Animals might love to play, but they don't love to watch.
So I had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious.
Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has?
I kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders.
Is television literally functioning as our conscience, tempting us and rewarding us at the same time?
So to begin to answer these questions, we did a research study.
We went back 50 years to the 1959/1960 television season.
We surveyed the top-20 Nielsen shows every year for 50 years -- a thousand shows.
We talked to over 3,000 individuals -- almost 3,600 -- aged 18 to 70, and we asked them how they felt emotionally.
How did you feel watching every single one of these shows?
Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity?
Did you feel outrage? Did you laugh?
What did this mean for you?
So to our global TED audiences, I want to say that this was a U.S. sample.
But as you can see, these emotional need states are truly universal.
And on a factual basis, over 80 percent of the U.S.'s most popular shows are exported around the world.
So I really hope our global audiences can relate.
Two acknowledgments before our first data slide: For inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis, I thank legendary rabbi, Jack Stern.
And for the way in which I'm going to present the data, I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling, who you may have just seen.
Okay, here we go.
So here you see, from 1960 to 2010, the 50 years of our study.
Two things we're going to start with -- the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state, which, for this purpose, we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me, that make me feel much more positive about the world.
Moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which I don't understand the difference between right and wrong.
As we start, you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady.
That's what we're watching TV for.
Moral ambiguity starts to climb.
Right at the end of the 60s, moral ambiguity is going up, inspiration is kind of on the wane.
Why?
The Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK is shot, the Civil Rights movement, race riots, the Vietnam War, MLK is shot, Bobby Kennedy is shot, Watergate.
Look what happens.
In 1970, inspiration plummets.
Moral ambiguity takes off.
They cross, but Ronald Reagan, a telegenic president, is in office.
It's trying to recover.
But look, it can't: AIDS, Iran-Contra, the Challenger disaster, Chernobyl.
Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from 1990 for the next 20 years.
Take a look at this.
This chart is going to document a very similar trend.
But in this case, we have comfort -- the bubble in red -- social commentary and irreverence in blue and green.
Now this time on TV you have "Bonanza," don't forget, you have "Gunsmoke," you have "Andy Griffith," you have domestic shows all about comfort.
This is rising. Comfort stays whole.
Irreverence starts to rise.
Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up.
You get to 1969, and look what happens.
You have comfort, irreverence, and social commentary, not only battling it out in our society, but you literally have two establishment shows -- "Gunsmoke" and "Gomer Pyle" -- in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows.
What's number one?
The socially irreverent hippie show, "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In."
They're all living together, right.
Viewers had responded dramatically.
Look at this green spike in 1966 to a bellwether show.
When you guys hear this industry term, a breakout hit, what does that mean?
It means in the 1966 television season, The "Smothers Brothers" came out of nowhere.
This was the first show that allowed viewers to say, "My God, I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War, about the presidency, through television?"
That's what we mean by a breakout show.
So then, just like the last chart, look what happens.
In 1970, the dam bursts. The dam bursts.
Comfort is no longer why we watch television.
Social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the 70s.
Now look at this.
The 70s means who? Norman Lear.
You have "All in the Family," "Sanford and Son," and the dominant show -- in the top-10 for the entire 70s -- "MAS*H."
In the entire 50 years of television that we studied, seven of 10 shows ranked most highly for irreverence appeared on air during the Vietnam War, five of the top-10 during the Nixon administration.
Only one generation, 20 years in, and we discovered, Wow! TV can do that?
It can make me feel this?
It can change us?
So to this very, very savvy crowd, I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disruptive.
Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago.
This is a quick chart. Here's another attribute: fantasy and imagination, which are shows defined as, "takes me out of my everyday realm" and "makes me feel better."
That's mapped against the red dot, unemployment, which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic.
You'll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise, it maps to a spike in unemployment.
Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed?
No. In the 70s you have the bellwether show "The Bionic Woman" that rocketed into the top-10 in 1973, followed by the "Six Million-Dollar Man" and "Charlie's Angels."
Another spike in the 1980s -- another spike in shows about control and power.
What were those shows?
Glamorous and rich.
"Dallas," "Fantasy Island."
Incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts: unemployment.
So here you are, in my favorite chart, because this is our last 20 years.
Whether or not you're in my business, you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom and the rise of reality TV.
Well, as we say in the business, X marks the spot.
The 90s -- the big bubbles of humor -- we're watching "Friends," "Frasier," "Cheers" and "Seinfeld."
Everything's good, low unemployment.
But look: X marks the spot.
In 2001, the September 2001 television season, humor succumbs to judgment once and for all.
Why not?
We had a 2000 presidential election decided by the Supreme Court.
We had the bursting of the tech bubble.
We had 9/11.
Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon.
Look what happens when we keep going.
At the turn of the century, the Internet takes off, reality television has taken hold.
What do people want in their TV then?
I would have thought revenge or nostalgia.
Give me some comfort; my world is falling apart.
No, they want judgment.
I can vote you off the island.
I can keep Sarah Palin's daughter dancing.
I can choose the next American Idol. You're fired.
That's all great, right?
So as dramatically different as these television shows, pure entertainment, have been over the last 50 years -- what did I start with? -- one basic instinct remains.
We're animals, we need our moms.
There has not been a decade of television without a definitive, dominant TV mom.
The 1950s: June Cleever in the original comfort show, "Leave it to Beaver."
Lucille Ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s.
Maude Findlay, the epitome of the irreverent 1970s, who tackled abortion, divorce, even menopause on TV.
The 1980s, our first cougar was given to us in the form of Alexis Carrington.
Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood.
This era's mom, Bree Van de Kamp.
Now I don't know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience, sitting on television's shoulders, but I do know that I absolutely love this image.
So to you all, the women of TEDWomen, the men of TEDWomen, the global audiences of TEDWomen, thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television.
But let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television.
They give it life on television, for sure, but it's you as viewers, through your collective social consciences, that give it life, longevity, power or not.
So thanks very much.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/tyler_dewitt_hey_science_teachers_make_it_fun.html</url>
Let me tell you a story.
It's my first year as a new high school science teacher, and I'm so eager.
I'm so excited, I'm pouring myself into my lesson plans.
But I'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything.
This happens one day: I'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology: viruses and how they attack.
And so I'm so excited to discuss this with them, and I come in and I say, "Can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool?"
There's silence.
Finally, my favorite student, she looks me straight in the eye, and she says, "The reading sucked."
And then she clarified. She said, "You know what, I don't mean that it sucks. It means that I didn't understand a word of it.
It's boring. Um, who cares, and it sucks."
These sympathetic smiles spread all throughout the room now, and I realize that all of my other students are in the same boat, that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook, but not one of them really understood the main ideas.
Not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool, why it's so important.
I'm totally clueless.
I have no idea what to do next.
So the only thing I can think of is say, "Listen. Let me tell you a story.
The main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses.
These guys are blown up a couple million times.
The real bacteria and viruses are so small we can't see them without a microscope, and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick.
But what a lot of people don't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick."
Now, the story that I start telling my kids, it starts out like a horror story.
Once upon a time there's this happy little bacterium.
Don't get too attached to him.
Maybe he's floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere, and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good.
Maybe he ate something bad for lunch, and then things get really horrible, as his skin rips apart, and he sees a virus coming out from his insides.
And then it gets horrible when he bursts open and an army of viruses floods out from his insides.
If -- Ouch is right! -- If you see this, and you're a bacterium, this is like your worst nightmare.
But if you're a virus and you see this, you cross those little legs of yours and you think, "We rock."
Because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium.
Here's what had to happen.
A virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its DNA into it.
The next thing is, that virus DNA made stuff that chopped up the bacteria DNA.
And now that we've gotten rid of the bacteria DNA, the virus DNA takes control of the cell and it tells it to start making more viruses.
Because, you see, DNA is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make.
So this is kind of like going into a car factory and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots.
The workers still come the next day, they do their job, but they're following different instructions.
So replacing the bacteria DNA with virus DNA turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses -- that is, until it's so filled with viruses that it bursts.
But that's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria.
Some are much more crafty.
When a secret agent virus infects a bacterium, they do a little espionage.
Here, this cloaked, secret agent virus is slipping his DNA into the bacterial cell, but here's the kicker: It doesn't do anything harmful -- not at first.
Instead, it silently slips into the bacteria's own DNA, and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell, waiting for instructions.
And what's interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies, the babies also have the virus DNA in them.
So now we have a whole extended bacteria family, filled with virus sleeper cells.
They're just happily living together until a signal happens and -- BAM! -- all of the DNA pops out.
It takes control of these cells, turns them into virus-making factories, and they all burst, a huge, extended bacteria family, all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts, the viruses taking over the bacterium.
So now you understand how viruses can attack cells.
There are two ways: On the left is what we call the lytic way, where the viruses go right in and take over the cells.
On the [right] is the lysogenic way that uses secret agent viruses.
So this stuff is not that hard, right?
And now all of you understand it.
But if you've graduated from high school, I can almost guarantee you've seen this information before.
But I bet it was presented in a way that it didn't exactly stick in your mind.
So when my students were first learning this, why did they hate it so much?
Well, there were a couple of reasons.
First of all, I can guarantee you that their textbooks didn't have secret agent viruses, and they didn't have horror stories.
You know, in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness.
It kills me. I'm not kidding.
I used to work for an educational publisher, and as a writer, I was always told never to use stories or fun, engaging language, because then my work might not be viewed as "serious" and "scientific."
Right? I mean, because God forbid somebody have fun when they're learning science.
So we have this field of science that's all about slime, and color changes. Check this out.
And then we have, of course, as any good scientist has to have, explosions!
But if a textbook seems too much fun, it's somehow unscientific.
Now another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible.
If we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier, we could start by saying something like, "These viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their DNA into a bacterium."
The way this showed up in the textbook, it looked like this: "Bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium."
That's great, perfect for 13-year-olds.
But here's the thing. There are plenty of people in science education who would look at this and say there's no way that we could ever give that to students, because it contains some language that isn't completely accurate.
For example, I told you that viruses have DNA.
Well, a very tiny fraction of them don't.
They have something called RNA instead.
So a professional science writer would circle that and say, "That has to go.
We have to change it to something much more technical."
And after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation, they'd find fault with almost every word I've used, and they'd have to change anything that wasn't serious enough, and they'd have to change everything that wasn't 100 percent perfect.
Then it would be accurate, but it would be completely impossible to understand.
This is horrifying.
You know, I keep talking about this idea of telling a story, and it's like science communication has taken on this idea of what I call the tyranny of precision, where you can't just tell a story.
It's like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know, who gives us all the details nobody cares about, where you're like, "Oh, I met my friend for lunch the other day, and she was wearing these ugly jeans.
I mean, they weren't really jeans, they were more kind of, like, leggings, but, like, I guess they're actually kind of more like jeggings, like, but I think — " and you're just like, "Oh my God.
What is the point?"
Or even worse, science education is becoming like that guy who always says, "Actually."
Right? You want to be like, "Oh, dude, we had to get up in the middle of the night and drive a hundred miles in total darkness."
And that guy's like, "Actually, it was 87.3 miles."
And you're like, "Actually, shut up!
I'm just trying to tell a story."
Because good storytelling is all about emotional connection.
We have to convince our audience that what we're talking about matters.
But just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across.
I'm reminded of what the architect Mies van der Rohe said, and I paraphrase, when he said that sometimes you have to lie in order to tell the truth.
I think this sentiment is particularly relevant to science education.
Now, finally, I am often so disappointed when people think that I'm advocating a dumbing down of science.
That's not true at all.
I'm currently a Ph.D. student at MIT, and I absolutely understand the importance of detailed, specific scientific communication between experts, but not when we're trying to teach 13-year-olds.
If a young learner thinks that all viruses have DNA, that's not going to ruin their chances of success in science.
But if a young learner can't understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this, that will ruin their chances of success.
This needs to stop, and I wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems, and I beg them, I beseech them to just stop it.
But I think that's unlikely.
So we are so lucky that we have resources like the Internet, where we can circumvent these institutions from the bottom up.
There's a growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just explaining science in simple, understandable ways.
I dream of a Wikipedia-like website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of in simple language any middle schooler can understand.
And I myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that I put on YouTube.
I explain chemical equilibrium using analogies to awkward middle school dances, and I talk about fuel cells with stories about boys and girls at a summer camp.
The feedback that I get is sometimes misspelled and it's often written in LOLcats, but nonetheless it's so appreciative, so thankful that I know this is the right way we should be communicating science.
There's still so much work left to be done, though, and if you're involved with science in any way I urge you to join me.
Pick up a camera, start to write a blog, whatever, but leave out the seriousness, leave out the jargon.
Make me laugh. Make me care.
Leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point.
How should you start?
Why don't you say, "Listen, let me tell you a story"?
Thank you.

<title>Tyler DeWitt: Hey science teachers -- make it fun</title>
<description>High school science teacher Tyler DeWitt was ecstatic about a lesson plan on bacteria -- and devastated when his students hated it. The problem was the textbook: it was impossible to understand. He delivers a rousing call for science teachers to ditch the jargon and extreme precision, and instead make science sing through stories and demonstrations. </description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_humanity_s_stairway_to_self_transcendence.html</url>
I have a question for you: Are you religious?
Please raise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religious person.
Let's see, I'd say about three or four percent.
I had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference.
Okay, here's another question: Do you think of yourself as spiritual in any way, shape or form? Raise your hand.
Okay, that's the majority.
My Talk today is about the main reason, or one of the main reasons, why most people consider themselves to be spiritual in some way, shape or form.
My Talk today is about self-transcendence.
It's just a basic fact about being human that sometimes the self seems to just melt away.
And when that happens, the feeling is ecstatic and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings.
We talk about being uplifted or elevated.
Now it's really hard to think about anything abstract like this without a good concrete metaphor.
So here's the metaphor I'm offering today.
Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms, most of which we're very familiar with.
But sometimes it's as though a doorway appears from out of nowhere and it opens onto a staircase.
We climb the staircase and experience a state of altered consciousness.
In 1902, the great American psychologist William James wrote about the many varieties of religious experience.
He collected all kinds of case studies.
He quoted the words of all kinds of people who'd had a variety of these experiences.
One of the most exciting to me is this young man, Stephen Bradley, had an encounter, he thought, with Jesus in 1820.
And here's what Bradley said about it.
Stephen Bradley: I thought I saw the savior in human shape for about one second in the room, with arms extended, appearing to say to me, "Come."
The next day I rejoiced with trembling.
My happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die.
This world had no place in my affections.
Previous to this time, I was very selfish and self-righteous.
But now I desired the welfare of all mankind and could, with a feeling heart, forgive my worst enemies.
JH: So note how Bradley's petty, moralistic self just dies on the way up the staircase.
And on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving.
The world's many religions have found so many ways to help people climb the staircase.
Some shut down the self using meditation.
Others use psychedelic drugs.
This is from a 16th century Aztec scroll showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god.
Others use dancing, spinning and circling to promote self-transcendence.
But you don't need a religion to get you through the staircase.
Lots of people find self-transcendence in nature.
Others overcome their self at raves.
But here's the weirdest place of all: war.
So many books about war say the same thing, that nothing brings people together like war.
And that bringing them together opens up the possibility of extraordinary self-transcendent experiences.
I'm going to play for you an excerpt from this book by Glenn Gray.
Gray was a soldier in the American army in World War II.
And after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers and wrote about the experience of men in battle.
Here's a key passage where he basically describes the staircase.
Glenn Gray: Many veterans will admit that the experience of communal effort in battle has been the high point of their lives.
"I" passes insensibly into a "we," "my" becomes "our" and individual faith loses its central importance.
I believe that it is nothing less than the assurance of immortality that makes self-sacrifice at these moments so relatively easy.
I may fall, but I do not die, for that which is real in me goes forward and lives on in the comrades for whom I gave up my life.
JH: So what all of these cases have in common is that the self seems to thin out, or melt away, and it feels good, it feels really good, in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives.
It feels somehow uplifting.
This idea that we move up was central in the writing of the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim.
Durkheim even called us Homo duplex, or two-level man.
The lower level he called the level of the profane.
Now profane is the opposite of sacred.
It just means ordinary or common.
And in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals.
We want to satisfy our individual desires.
We pursue our individual goals.
But sometimes something happens that triggers a phase change.
Individuals unite into a team, a movement or a nation, which is far more than the sum of its parts.
Durkheim called this level the level of the sacred because he believed that the function of religion was to unite people into a group, into a moral community.
Durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness.
And once people circle around some sacred object or value, they'll then work as a team and fight to defend it.
Durkheim wrote about a set of intense collective emotions that accomplish this miracle of E pluribus unum, of making a group out of individuals.
Think of the collective joy in Britain on the day World War II ended.
Think of the collective anger in Tahrir Square, which brought down a dictator.
And think of the collective grief in the United States that we all felt, that brought us all together, after 9/11.
So let me summarize where we are.
I'm saying that the capacity for self-transcendence is just a basic part of being human.
I'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind.
I'm saying we are Homo duplex and this staircase takes us up from the profane level to the level of the sacred.
When we climb that staircase, self-interest fades away, we become just much less self-interested, and we feel as though we are better, nobler and somehow uplifted.
So here's the million-dollar question for social scientists like me: Is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design?
Is it a product of natural selection, like our hands?
Or is it a bug, a mistake in the system -- this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain -- Jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience, it's just a mistake?
Well many scientists who study religion take this view.
The New Atheists, for example, argue that religion is a set of memes, sort of parasitic memes, that get inside our minds and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff, self-destructive stuff, like suicide bombing.
And after all, how could it ever be good for us to lose ourselves?
How could it ever be adaptive for any organism to overcome self-interest?
Well let me show you.
In "The Descent of Man," Charles Darwin wrote a great deal about the evolution of morality -- where did it come from, why do we have it.
Darwin noted that many of our virtues are of very little use to ourselves, but they're of great use to our groups.
He wrote about the scenario in which two tribes of early humans would have come in contact and competition.
He said, "If the one tribe included a great number of courageous, sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other, this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other."
He went on to say that "Selfish and contentious people will not cohere, and without coherence nothing can be effected."
In other words, Charles Darwin believed in group selection.
Now this idea has been very controversial for the last 40 years, but it's about to make a major comeback this year, especially after E.O. Wilson's book comes out in April, making a very strong case that we, and several other species, are products of group selection.
But really the way to think about this is as multilevel selection.
So look at it this way: You've got competition going on within groups and across groups.
So here's a group of guys on a college crew team.
Within this team there's competition.
There are guys competing with each other.
The slowest rowers, the weakest rowers, are going to get cut from the team.
And only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport.
Maybe one of them will make it to the Olympics.
So within the team, their interests are actually pitted against each other.
And sometimes it would be advantageous for one of these guys to try to sabotage the other guys.
Maybe he'll badmouth his chief rival to the coach.
But while that competition is going on within the boat, this competition is going on across boats.
And once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat, now they've got no choice but to cooperate because they're all in the same boat.
They can only win if they all pull together as a team.
I mean, these things sound trite, but they are deep evolutionary truths.
The main argument against group selection has always been that, well sure, it would be nice to have a group of cooperators, but as soon as you have a group of cooperators, they're just going to get taken over by free-riders, individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others.
Let me illustrate this for you.
Suppose we've got a group of little organisms -- they can be bacteria, they can be hamsters; it doesn't matter what -- and let's suppose that this little group here, they evolved to be cooperative.
Well that's great. They graze, they defend each other, they work together, they generate wealth.
And as you'll see in this simulation, as they interact they gain points, as it were, they grow, and when they've doubled in size, you'll see them split, and that's how they reproduce and the population grows.
But suppose then that one of them mutates.
There's a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy.
It takes advantage of the others.
And so when a green interacts with a blue, you'll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller.
So here's how things play out.
We start with just one green, and as it interacts it gains wealth or points or food.
And in short order, the cooperators are done for.
The free-riders have taken over.
If a group cannot solve the free-rider problem then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation and group selection cannot get started.
But there are solutions to the free-rider problem.
It's not that hard a problem.
In fact, nature has solved it many, many times.
And nature's favorite solution is to put everyone in the same boat.
For example, why is it that the mitochondria in every cell has its own DNA, totally separate from the DNA in the nucleus?
It's because they used to be separate free-living bacteria and they came together and became a superorganism.
Somehow or other -- maybe one swallowed another; we'll never know exactly why -- but once they got a membrane around them, they were all in the same membrane, now all the wealth-created division of labor, all the greatness created by cooperation, stays locked inside the membrane and we've got a superorganism.
And now let's rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free-riders, of defectors, of cheaters and look what happens.
A superorganism can basically take what it wants.
It's so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens, from the defectors, the cheaters.
And pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms.
What I've shown you here is sometimes called a major transition in evolutionary history.
Darwin's laws don't change, but now there's a new kind of player on the field and things begin to look very different.
Now this transition was not a one-time freak of nature that just happened with some bacteria.
It happened again about 120 or a 140 million years ago when some solitary wasps began creating little simple, primitive nests, or hives.
Once several wasps were all together in the same hive, they had no choice but to cooperate, because pretty soon they were locked into competition with other hives.
And the most cohesive hives won, just as Darwin said.
These early wasps gave rise to the bees and the ants that have covered the world and changed the biosphere.
And it happened again, even more spectacularly, in the last half-million years when our own ancestors became cultural creatures, they came together around a hearth or a campfire, they divided labor, they began painting their bodies, they spoke their own dialects, and eventually they worshiped their own gods.
Once they were all in the same tribe, they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside.
And they unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet, which is human cooperation -- a force for construction and destruction.
Of course, human groups are nowhere near as cohesive as beehives.
Human groups may look like hives for brief moments, but they tend to then break apart.
We're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are.
In fact, often, as we've seen happen in a lot of the Arab Spring revolts, often those divisions are along religious lines.
Nonetheless, when people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement, they can move mountains.
Look at the people in these photos I've been showing you.
Do you think they're there pursuing their self-interest?
Or are they pursuing communal interest, which requires them to lose themselves and become simply a part of a whole?
Okay, so that was my Talk delivered in the standard TED way.
And now I'm going to give the whole Talk over again in three minutes in a more full-spectrum sort of way.
Jonathan Haidt: We humans have many varieties of religious experience, as William James explained.
One of the most common is climbing the secret staircase and losing ourselves.
The staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary upwards to the experience of life as sacred, or deeply interconnected.
We are Homo duplex, as Durkheim explained.
And we are Homo duplex because we evolved by multilevel selection, as Darwin explained.
I can't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation rather than a bug, but if it is an adaptation, then the implications are profound.
If it is an adaptation, then we evolved to be religious.
I don't mean that we evolved to join gigantic organized religions.
Those things came along too recently.
I mean that we evolved to see sacredness all around us and to join with others into teams and circle around sacred objects, people and ideas.
This is why politics is so tribal.
Politics is partly profane, it's partly about self-interest, but politics is also about sacredness.
It's about joining with others to pursue moral ideas.
It's about the eternal struggle between good and evil, and we all believe we're on the good team.
And most importantly, if the staircase is real, it explains the persistent undercurrent of dissatisfaction in modern life.
Because human beings are, to some extent, hivish creatures like bees.
We're bees. We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment.
We broke down the old institutions and brought liberty to the oppressed.
We unleashed Earth-changing creativity and generated vast wealth and comfort.
Nowadays we fly around like individual bees exulting in our freedom.
But sometimes we wonder: Is this all there is?
What should I do with my life?
What's missing?
What's missing is that we are Homo duplex, but modern, secular society was built to satisfy our lower, profane selves.
It's really comfortable down here on the lower level.
Come, have a seat in my home entertainment center.
One great challenge of modern life is to find the staircase amid all the clutter and then to do something good and noble once you climb to the top.
I see this desire in my students at the University of Virginia.
They all want to find a cause or calling that they can throw themselves into.
They're all searching for their staircase.
And that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish.
Most people long to overcome pettiness and become part of something larger.
And this explains the extraordinary resonance of this simple metaphor conjured up nearly 400 years ago.
"No man is an island entire of itself.
Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main."
JH: Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/sam_martin_builds_a_room_of_his_own.html</url>
So, I am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves, but first I want to tell you why I'm here.
I'm here for two reasons. These two guys are my two sons Ford and Wren.
When Ford was about three years old, we shared a very small room together, in a very small space.
My office was on one half of the bedroom, and his bedroom was on the other half.
And you can imagine, if you're a writer, that things would get really crowded around deadlines.
So when Wren was on the way, I realized I needed to find a space of my own.
There was no more space in the house. So I went out to the backyard, and without any previous building experience, and about 3,000 dollars and some recycled materials, I built this space.
It had everything I needed. It was quiet.
There was enough space. And I had control, which was very important.
As I was building this space, I thought to myself, "Surely I'm not the only guy to have to have carved out a space for his own."
So I did some research.
And I found that there was an historic precedence.
Hemingway had his writing space.
Elvis had two or three manspaces, which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland.
In the popular culture, Superman had the Fortress of Solitude, and there was, of course, the Batcave.
So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now.
Here is one of the first spaces I found. It is in Austin, Texas, which is where I'm from.
On the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage.
But on the inside, it's anything but.
And this, to me, is a pretty classic manspace.
It has neon concert posters, a bar and, of course, the leg lamp, which is very important.
I soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside.
This guy built a bowling alley in his backyard, out of landscaping timbers, astroturf.
And he found the scoreboard in the trash.
Here's another outdoor space, a little bit more sophisticated.
This a 1923 wooden tugboat, made completely out of Douglas fir.
The guy did it all himself.
And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside.
So, pretty early on in my investigations I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find, which was, quite frankly, a lot of beer can pyramids and overstuffed couches and flat-screen TVs.
There were definitely hang-out spots.
But some were for working, some were for playing, some were for guys to collect their things.
Most of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding.
Take this place for example.
On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage.
This is in Long Island, New York.
The only thing that might tip you off is the round window.
On the inside it's a recreation of a 16th century Japanese tea house.
The man imported all the materials from Japan, and he hired a Japanese carpenter to build it in the traditional style.
It has no nails or screws.
All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed.
Here is another pretty typical scene. This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood.
But you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional-size boxing ring inside.
And so there is a good reason for this.
It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough.
He won the silver medal for Ireland in the 1992 Olympics, and he trains in this space. He trains other people.
And right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments, which is another sort of important part about a manspace.
So, while this space represents someone's profession, this one certainly represents a passion.
It's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship.
It's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s.
Museum quality.
So, as I came to the end of my journey, I found over 50 spaces.
And they were unexpected and they were surprising.
But they were also -- I was really impressed by how personalized they were, and how much work went into them.
And I realized that's because the guys that I met were all very passionate about what they did.
And they really loved their professions.
And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies.
And so they created these spaces to reflect what they love to do, and who they were.
So if you don't have a space of your own, I highly recommend finding one, and getting into it.
Thank you very much.

I had requested slides, kind of adamantly, up till the -- pretty much, last few days, but was denied access to a slide projector.
I actually find them a lot more emotional -- -- and personal, and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work, unlike PowerPoint and some other programs.
Now, I agree that you have to -- yeah, there are certain concessions and, you know, if you use a slide projector, you're not able to have the bad type swing in from the back or the side, or up or down, but maybe that's an O.K. trade-off, to trade that off for a focus.
It's a thought. Just a thought.
And there's something nice about slides getting stuck.
And the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up, which we won't see tonight. So.
With that, let's get the first slide up here.
This, as many of you have probably guessed, is a recently emptied beer can in Portugal.
This -- I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time, and I thought -- you know, fly all night, I looked up, and I thought, wow, how clean.
You come into this major airport, and they simply have a B.
I mean, how nice is that?
Everything's gotten simpler in design, and here's this mega airport, and God, I just -- I took a picture.
I thought, God, that is the coolest thing I've ever seen at an airport.
Till a couple months later, I went back to the same airport -- same plane, I think -- and looked up, and it said C.
It was only then that I realized it was simply a gate that I was coming into.
I'm a big believer in the emotion of design, and the message that's sent before somebody begins to read, before they get the rest of the information; what is the emotional response they get to the product, to the story, to the painting -- whatever it is.
That area of design interests me the most, and I think this for me is a real clear, very simplified version of what I'm talking about.
These are a couple of garage doors painted identical, situated next to each other.
So, here's the first door. You know, you get the message.
You know, it's pretty clear.
Take a look at the second door and see if there's any different message.
O.K., which one would you park in front of?
Same color, same message, same words.
The only thing that's different is the expression that the individual door-owner here put into the piece -- and, again, which is the psycho-killer here?
Yet it doesn't say that; it doesn't need to say that.
I would probably park in front of the other one.
I'm sure a lot of you are aware that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last five years or so.
It's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more expressive.
But I was in Milan and saw this street sign, and was very happy to see that apparently this idea of minimalism has even been translated by the graffiti artist.
And this graffiti artist has come along, made this sign a little bit better, and then moved on.
He didn't overpower it like they have a tendency to do.
This is for a book by "Metropolis."
I took some photos, and this is a billboard in Florida, and either they hadn't paid their rent, or they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign, and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down, so they just teared out sections of it.
And I would argue that it's possibly more effective than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention, getting you to look over that way.
And hopefully you don't stop and buy those awful pecan things -- Stuckey's.
This is from my second book.
The first book is called, "The End of Print," and it was done along with a film, working with William Burroughs.
And "The End of Print" is now in its fifth printing.
When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it, he said no; he said he didn't believe it was the end of print.
And I said, well, that's fine; I just would love to have your input on this film and this book, and he finally agreed to it.
And at the end of the film, he says in this great voice that I can't mimic but I'll kind of try, but not really, he says, "I remember attending an exhibition called, 'Photography: The End of Painting.'" And then he says, "And, of course, it wasn't at all."
So, apparently when photography was perfected, there were people going around saying, that's it: you've just ruined painting.
People are just going to take pictures now.
And of course, that wasn't the case.
So, this is from "2nd Sight," a book I did on intuition.
I think it's not the only ingredient in design, but possibly the most important.
It's something everybody has.
It's not a matter of teaching it; in fact, most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can't quantify it: it's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design, but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter.
So it tends to get discounted.
This is a quote from Albert Einstein, who says, "The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery.
There comes a leap in consciousness -- call it intuition or what you will -- and the solution just comes to you, and you don't know from where or why."
So, it's kind of like when somebody says, Who did that song?
And the more you try to think about it, the further the answer gets from you, and the minute you stop thinking about it, your intuition gives you that answer, in a sense.
I like this for a couple of reasons.
If you've had any design courses, they would teach you you can't read this.
I think you eventually can and, more importantly, I think it's true.
"Don't mistake legibility for communication."
Just because something's legible doesn't means it communicates.
More importantly, it doesn't mean it communicates the right thing.
So, what is the message sent before somebody actually gets into the material?
And I think that's sometimes an overlooked area.
This is working with Marshall McLuhan.
I stayed and worked with his wife and son, Eric, and we came up with close to 600 quotes from Marshall that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times, predicting so much of what has happened in the advertising, television, media world.
And so this book is called "Probes." It's another word for quotes.
And it's -- a lot of them are never -- have never been published before, and basically, I've interpreted the different quotes.
So, this was the contents page originally.
When I got done it was 540 pages, and then the publisher, Gingko Press, ended up cutting it down considerably: it's just under 400 pages now.
But I decided I liked this contents page -- I liked the way it looks -- so I kept it.
It now has no relevance to the book whatsoever, but it's a nice spread, I think, in there.
So, a couple spreads from the book: here McLuhan says, "The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature; they are Nature."
"The invention of printing did away with anonymity, fostering ideas of literary fame and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property," which had never been done before printing.
"When new technologies impose themselves on societies long habituated to older technologies, anxieties of all kinds result."
"While people are engaged in creating a totally different world, they always form vivid images of the preceding world."
I hate this stuff. It's hard to read.
"People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe, and no possible occupation except information gathering."
That was it. That's all he saw as the options. And not too far off.
So, this is a project for Nine Inch Nails.
And I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden, and it was done right after 9/11.
And I had recently discovered a bomb shelter in the backyard of a house I had bought in LA that the real estate person hadn't pointed out.
There was some bomb shelter built, apparently in the '60s Cuban missile crisis.
And I asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by, and he goes, "It's something to do with the sewage system."
I was, O.K.; that's fine.
I finally went down there, and it was this old rusted circular thing, and two beds, and very kind of creepy and weird.
And also, surprisingly, it was done in kind of a cheap metal, and it had completely rusted through, and water everywhere, and spiders.
And I thought, you know, what were they thinking?
You'd think maybe cement, possibly, or something.
But anyway, I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD, and I've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape, and it's ready. I think I'm ready. So.
This is an experiment, really, for a client, Quicksilver, where we were taking what was a six-shot sequence and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the Web.
So, this is a six-shot sequence.
I've taken one shot; I cropped it a few different ways.
And then the tiny line of copy says, If you want to see this entire sequence -- how this whole ride was -- go to the website.
And my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site to get this entire picture.
Got no way of tracking it, so I could be totally wrong.
I don't have the site. It's just the piece itself.
This is a group in New York called the Coalition for a Smoke-free Environment -- asked me to do these posters.
They were wild-posted around New York City.
You can't really -- well, you can't see it at all -- but the second line is really the more kind of payoff, in a sense.
It says, "If the cigarette companies can lie, then so can we." But -- -- but I did.
These were literally wild-posted all over New York one night, and there were definitely some heads turning, you know, people smoking and, "Huh!"
And it was purposely done to look fairly serious.
It wasn't some, you know, weird grunge type or something; it looked like they might be real. Anyway.
Poster for Atlantic Center for the Arts, a school in Florida.
This amazes me. This is a product I just found out.
I was in the Caribbean at Christmas, and I'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell -- not that they will sell -- that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin.
This was either an old product with new packaging, or a brand-new package, and I just thought, Yikes! How's that still happening?
I do a lot of workshops all over the world, really, and this particular assignment was to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors.
I felt this was one of the more successful solutions.
The students actually cut them up and put them up around bars and restaurants that night, and I just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom ...
I did some work for Microsoft a few years back.
It was a worldwide branding campaign.
And it was interesting to me -- my background is in sociology; I had no design training, and sometimes people say, well, that explains it -- but it was a very interesting experiment because there's no product that I had to sell; it was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve.
They thought some people didn't like them.
I found out that's very true, working on this campaign worldwide.
And our goal was to try to humanize them a bit, and what I did was add type and people to the ad, which the previous campaign had not had, and nobody remembered them, and nobody referenced them.
And we were trying to say that, hey, some of these guys that work there are actually OK; some of them actually have friends and family, and they're not all awful people.
And the umbrella campaign was "Thank God it's Monday."
So, we tried to take this -- what was perceived as a negative: their over-competitiveness, their, you know, long working hours -- and turn it into a positive and not run from it.
You know: Thank God it's Monday -- I get to go back to that little cubicle, those fake gray walls, and hear everybody else's conversations f or 10 hours and then go home.
But anyway, this is one of the ads I was most pleased with, because they were all elaborately art-directed, and this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer.
It says, "Wonder Around." And then it's a piece of the software.
And this is how the ad ran around the world.
In Germany, they made one small change without checking with me -- nor did they have to, because it was done through agencies -- but see if you can tell the difference.
This is how the ad ran throughout the world; Germany made one slight change in the ad.
Now, there's kind of two issues here.
If you're going to put a kid in the ad, pick one that looks alive.
I just have a feeling this kid's been there for a week, you know.
He's just really hoping that boots up and, you know ...
And then as the agency explained to me, they said, "Look, we don't have little green people in our country; why would we put little green people in our ads, for instance?"
So, I understand their logic. I totally disagree with it; I think it's a very small-minded approach, the world is certainly much more global, and I certainly think the people of Germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer, though we'll never know.
This is some work from Ray Gun.
And the point of this magazine was to read the articles, listen to the music, and try to interpret it.
There's no grid, there's no system, there's nothing set up in advance.
This is an opener for Brian Eno, and it's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music.
This is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school.
There's a lot of great writing in "Ray Gun."
And I was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books.
Article on Bryan Ferry -- just really boring article -- so I set the whole article in Dingbat.
You could -- you could highlight it; you could make it Helvetica or something: it is the actual article.
I suppose you could eventually decode it, but it's really not very well written; it really wouldn't be worthwhile.
Having done a lot of magazines, I'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories, and I was very curious to see how Time and Newsweek would handle 9/11.
And I was basically pretty disappointed to see that they had chosen to show the photo we'd already seen a million times, which was basically the moment of impact.
And People magazine, I thought, got probably the best shot.
It's kind of horsey type, but the texture -- the second plane not quite hitting: there was something more enticing, if that's the right -- it's not the right word -- but in this cover than Time or Newsweek.
But when I got into this magazine, there's something kind of disturbing, and this continued.
On the left we see people dying; we see people running for their lives.
And on the right we learn that there's a new way to support your breast.
The coveted right-hand page was not given up to the whole issue.
Look at the image of this lady -- who knows what she's going through? -- and the copy says: "He knows just how to give me goosebumps."
Yeah, he jumps out of buildings. It's -- unfortunately, this one works, kind of, as a spread.
And this continued through the entire magazine.
It did not let up.
This says: "One clean fits all." .
There were a lot of orphans made this day, and here's a dead body being brought out.
It just seems to me possibly even a blank page would have been more appropriate.
And this one I think is possibly the worst: two ladies, both facing the same way, both wearing jeans.
One -- who knows what she's going through; the other one is worried about model behavior and milk.
And -- I gave a talk in New York a couple months after this, and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that -- they actually emailed me -- and they said that they appreciated the talk, and when they got back to their car, they found a note on their car that made them think maybe New York was getting back to being New York again after this event -- it had been a few months.
This was what they found on their car.
There's very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car, but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back.
This is my desktop.
Somebody told me today there was this thing called folders, but I don't know what they are.
These are my notes for the talk -- there might be a correlation here.
We are wrapping up.
This I saw on the plane, flying in, for hot new products.
I'm not sure this is an improvement, or a good idea, because, like, if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer, you can now get a plate in the keyboard, so there's no more faking it -- that you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway.
Now there's a plate, and it would be really, really convenient to get a piece of pizza, then type a little bit, then ...
I'm just not sure this is improvement.
If you ever doubt the power of graphic design, this is a very generic sign that literally says, "Vote for Hitler." It says nothing else.
And this to me is an extreme case of the power of emotion, of graphic design, even though, in fact, was a very generic poster at the time.
What's next? What's next is going to be people.
As we get more technically driven, the importance of people becomes more than it's ever been before.
You have to utilize who you are in your work.
Nobody else can do that: nobody else can pull from your background, from your parents, your upbringing, your whole life experience.
If you allow that to happen, it's really the only way you can do some unique work, and you're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well.
This is -- I like found art; hand lettering's coming back in a big way, and I thought this was a great example of both.
This lady's advertising for her lost pit bull.
It's friendly -- she's underlined friendly -- that's probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles. She can't spell.
But more importantly, she's willing to give you 20 bucks to go find this lost pit bull.
And I'm thinking, yeah, right, I'll go look for a lost pit bill for 20 bucks.
I have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles, and you get charged by this thing and you go, oh, please be Hercles; please be the friendly one.
I'm sure she never found the dog, because I took the sign.
But I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back.
And the theme was courage, and they asked me to talk about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer.
And I remembered seeing this photograph of my father, who was a test pilot, and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot, they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance of death on the job.
That's pretty high for most occupations.
But, you know, the government would make a plane; they'd say, go see if that one flies, would you?
Some of them did; some of them didn't.
And I started thinking about some of these decisions I have to make between, like, serif versus san-serif.
And for the most part, they're not real life-threatening.
Why not experiment? Why not have some fun?
Why not put some of yourself into the work?
And when I was teaching, I used to always ask the students, What's the definition of a good job?
And as teachers, after you get all the answers, you like to give them the correct answer.
And the best one I've heard -- I'm sure some of you have heard this -- the definition of a good job is: If you could afford to -- if money wasn't an issue -- would you be doing that same work?
And if you would, you've got a great job.
And if you wouldn't, what the heck are you doing?
You're going to be dead a really long time.
Thank you very much.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_kelly_on_how_technology_evolves.html</url>
I don't know about you, but I haven't quite figured out exactly what technology means in my life.
I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about.
Should I be pro-technology? Should I embrace it full arms?
Should I be wary? Like you, I'm very tempted by the latest thing.
But at the other hand, a couple of years ago I gave up all of my possessions, sold all my technology -- except for a bicycle -- and rode across 3,000 miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body, fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food.
And I've since then tried to keep technology at arm's length in many ways, so it doesn't master my life.
At the same time, I run a website on cool tools, where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology.
So I'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is as it relates to humanity, as it relates to nature, as it relates to the spiritual.
And I'm not even sure we know what technology is.
And one definition of technology is that which is first recorded.
This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find.
It was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829.
Before that, obviously, technology didn't exist. But obviously it did.
I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology.
He says technology is anything that was invented after you were born.
So it sums up a lot of what we're talking about.
Danny Hillis actually has an update on that -- he says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet.
Which also, I think, gets into a little bit of our current idea.
But I was interested in another definition of technology.
Something, again, that went back to something more fundamental.
Something that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that, I came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to work for me in my investigations.
And I'm, this morning, going to talk about this for the first time.
So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud.
The question that I came up with was this question: what does technology want? And by that, I don't mean, does it want chocolate or vanilla? By what it wants, I mean, what are its inherent trends and biases?
What are its tendencies over time? One way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms, which we've heard a lot about.
And the trick that Richard Dawkins does, which is to say, to look at them as simply as genes, as vehicles for genes.
So he's saying, what do genes want? The selfish gene.
And I'm applying a similar trick to say, what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology? What does technology want?
Obviously, this in an incomplete question, just as looking at an organism as only a gene is an incomplete way of looking at it.
But it's still very, very productive. So I'm attempting to say, if we take technology's view of the world, what does it want?
And I think once we ask that question we have to go back, actually, to life. Because obviously, if we keep extending the origins of technology far back, I think we come back to life at some point.
So that's where I want to begin my little exploration, is in life.
And like you heard from the previous speakers, we don't really know what life there is on Earth right now.
We have really no idea.
Craig Venter's tremendous and brilliant attempt to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great.
Brian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on Earth.
And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects, just to see what's on life. And if we did that with our little Martian probe, which we have not done on Earth, we would begin to see some incredible species.
This is not on another planet. These are things that are hidden away on our planet.
This is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen.
Each one of these organisms that we've described -- that you've seen from Jamie and others, these magnificent things -- what they're doing, each one of them, is they're hacking the rules of life.
I can't think of a single general principle of biology that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism.
Every single thing that we can think of -- and if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits, you'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life, because every single one of them is hacking something about it.
This is a solar-powered sea slug. It's a nudibranch that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy.
This is another version of that. This is a sea dragon, and the one on the bottom, the blue one, is a juvenile that has not yet swallowed the acid, has not yet taken in the brown-green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy.
These are hacks, and if we looked at the general shape of the approaches to hacking life there are, current consensus, six kingdoms. Six different broad approaches: the plants, the animals, the fungi, the protests -- the little things -- the bacteria and the Archaea bacteria. The Archaeas.
Those are the general approaches to life. That's one way to look at life on Earth today.
But a more interesting way, the current way to take the long view, is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective.
And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution go over the linear time, we have it coming out from the center.
So in the center is the most primitive, and this is a genealogical chart of all life on earth. This is all the same six kingdoms.
You see 4,000 representative species, and you can see where we are.
But what I like about this is it shows that every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved.
Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans.
They've been around just as long and gone through just the same kind of trial and error to get here.
But we see that each one of these is actually hacking, and has a different way of finding out how to do life.
And if we take the long-term trends of life, if we begin to say, what does evolution want? There's several things that we see.
One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth have we ever been where we don't find life.
We find life at the bottom of every long-term, long-distance drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up -- and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock.
And wherever life is, it never retreats. It's ubiquitous and it wants to be more.
More and more of the inert matter of the globe is being touched and animated by life.
The second thing is is we see diversity. We also see specialization.
We see the movement from a general-purpose cell to the more specific and specialized.
And we see a drift towards complexity that's very intuitive.
And actually, we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time.
And the last thing, I bring back this nudibranch.
One of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability. And by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life.
Like those chloroplast cells -- they're completely surrounded by other life.
They never touch the inner matter. There is more and more co-evolution.
And so the general, long-term trends of evolution are roughly these five: ubiquity, diversity, specialization, complexity and socialization. Now, I took that and said, OK, what are the long-term trends in technology?
And again, my question is, what does technology want?
And so, remarkably, I discovered that there's also a drift toward specialization.
That we see there's a general hammer, and hammers become more and more specific over time.
There's obviously diversity. Huge numbers of things.
This is all the contents of a Japanese home.
I actually had my daughter -- gave her a tally counter, and I gave her an assignment last summer to go around and count the number of species of technology in our household.
And it came up with 6,000 different species of products.
I did some research and found out that the King of England, Henry VIII, had only about 7,000 items in his household.
And he was the King of England, and that was the entire wealth of England at the time.
So we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things.
This is a scene from Star Wars where the 3PO comes out and he sees machines making machines. How depraved!
Well, this is actually what we're headed towards: world machines.
And the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies.
Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology and not non-technology, or even life.
And thirdly, the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a cliche. And I'm happy to say, I was partly responsible for that cliche that machines are becoming biological, but that's pretty evident.
So the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution. The same drives that we see towards ubiquity, towards diversity, towards socialization, towards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out, say, the evolution of armor, you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree.
I suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.
That its operations and how it works is so similar that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom.
And so it would be sort of approximately up there, coming out of the animal kingdom. And if we were to do that, we would find out -- we could actually approach technology in this way.
This is Niles Eldredge. He was the co-developer with Stephen Jay Gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium.
But as a sideline, he happens to collect cornets.
He has one of the world's largest collections -- about 500 of them.
And he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites, or snails, and to do a morphological analysis, and try to derive their genealogical history over time.
This is his chart, which is not quite published yet.
But the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom, those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made. That does not happen in biology.
When something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent.
But that does happen in technology. And it turns out that that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree, and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system.
In fact, this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that I began to think about what happens with old technology.
And it turns out that, in fact, technologies don't die.
So I suggested this to an historian of science, and he said, "Well, what about, you know, come on, what about steam cars?
They're not around anymore." Well actually, they are.
In fact, they're so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile.
And this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts for the Stanley automobile. And the thing that I liked is sort of this one-click, add-to-your-cart button -- -- for buying steam valves. I mean, it was just -- it was really there.
And so, I began to think about, well, maybe that's just a random sample.
Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way.
So I took the great big 1895 Montgomery Ward's catalog and I randomly went through it. And I took a page -- not quite a random page -- I took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made. But I took this page and I said, how many of these things are still being made?
And not antiques. I want to know how many of these things are still in production.
And the answer is: all of them.
All of them are still being produced. So you've got corn shellers.
I don't know who needs a corn sheller.
Be it corn shellers -- you've got ploughs; you've got fan mills; all these things -- and these are not, again, antiques. These are -- you can order these. You can go to the web and you can buy them now, brand-new made. So in a certain sense, technologies don't die.
In fact, you can buy, for 50 bucks, a stone-age knife made exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago.
It's short, bone handle, 50 bucks. And in fact, what's important is that this information actually never died out.
It's not just that it was resurrected. It's continued all along.
And in Papua New Guinea, they were making stone axes until two decades ago, just as a course of practical matters.
Even when we try to get rid of a technology, it's actually very hard.
So we've all heard about the Amish giving up cars.
We've heard about the Japanese giving up guns.
We've heard about this and that. But I actually went back and took what I could find, the examples in history where there have been prohibitions against technology, and then I tried to find out when they came back in, because they always came back in. And it turns out that the time, the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited, is decreasing over time. And that basically, you can delay technology, but you can't kill it. So this makes sense, because in a certain sense what culture is, is the accumulation of ideas.
That's what it's for. It's so that ideas don't die out.
And when we take that, we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again, in life's evolution -- we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life -- what they're really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens.
They're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated.
So all these steps in evolution are increasing, basically, the evolution of evolvability.
So what's happening over time in life is that the ways in which you generate these new ideas, these new hacks, are increasing. And the real tricks are ways in which you kind of explore the way of exploring.
And then what we see in the singularity, that prophesized by Kurzweil and others -- his idea that technology is accelerating evolution.
It's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas.
So if you have life hacking -- life means hacking, the game of survival -- then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game.
And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve.
That is what we call an "infinite game."
That's the definition of "infinite game." A finite game is play to win, and an infinite game is played to keep playing.
And I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force.
The origins of technology was not in 1829, but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang, and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compressed. The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot, and it was so tight in there, there was no room for any difference at all.
That's the definition. There was no temperature.
There was no difference whatsoever. And at the Big Bang, what it expanded was the potential for difference.
So as it expands and as things expand what we have is the potential for differences, diversity, options, choices, opportunities, possibilities and freedoms.
Those are all basically the same thing.
And those are the things that technology brings us.
That's what technology is bringing us: choices, possibilities, freedoms.
That's what it's about. It's this expansion of room to make differences.
And so a hammer, when we grab a hammer, that's what we're grabbing.
And that's why we continue to grab technology -- because we want those things. Those things are good.
Differences, freedom, choices, possibilities.
And each time we make a new opportunity place, we're allowing a platform to make new ones.
And I think it's really important. Because if you can imagine Mozart before the technology of the piano was invented -- what a loss to society there would be.
Imagine Van Gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints.
Imagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film.
Somewhere, today, there are millions of young children being born whose technology of self-expression has not yet been invented.
We have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference.
We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals.
That's what technology really wants.
I'm going to skip through some of the objections because I don't have answers to why there's deforestation.
I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies. I don't have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity, other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom, because it's so close to what life is about, maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life.
Maybe in some ways the fact that what we're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it.
It's a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields, but it's a really good thing to use to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village.
Our humanity is actually defined by technology.
All the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology. This is the infinite game.
That's what we're talking about.
You see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution.
It's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more.
And it's actually a way of playing the game, of playing all the games.
That's what technology wants.
And so when I think about what technology wants, I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here -- and I really believe this -- every person here has an assignment. And your assignment is to spend your life discovering what your assignment is.
That recursive nature is the infinite game.
And if you play that well, you'll have other people involved, so even that game extends and continues even when you're gone.
That is the infinite game. And what technology is is the medium in which we play that infinite game.
And so I think that we should embrace technology because it is an essential part of our journey in finding out who we are.
Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/mike_degruy_hooked_by_octopus.html</url>
I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age.
I grew up in Mobile, Alabama -- somebody's got to be from Mobile, right? -- and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers, forming this beautiful delta.
And the delta has alligators crawling in and out of rivers filled with fish and cypress trees dripping with snakes, birds of every flavor.
It's an absolute magical wonderland to live in -- if you're a kid interested in animals, to grow up in.
And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay, and finally into the Gulf of Mexico.
And I remember my first real contact with octopus was probably at age five or six.
I was in the gulf, and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom.
And I reached down and picked him up, and immediately became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility.
It was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand.
It was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature.
Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands and started flashing colors, just pulsing all of these colors.
And as I looked at it, it kind of tucked its arms under it, raised into a spherical shape and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes.
I'm going, "My gosh!" I had never seen anything like this in my life!
So I marveled for a moment, and then decided it was time to release him, so I put him down.
The octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing: It landed on the bottom in the rubble and -- fwoosh! -- vanished right before my eyes.
And I knew, right then, at age six, that is an animal that I want to learn more about. So I did.
And I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology, and then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate school at the University of Hawaii.
And while a student at Hawaii, I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium.
And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays, and being the spineless guy, I thought, well I'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals I had been learning about as a student and bring them in, and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display.
Now, the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at, but they didn't really interact with people.
But the octopus did.
If you walked up to an octopus tank, especially early in the morning before anyone arrived, the octopus would rise up and look at you and you're thinking, "Is that guy really looking at me? He is looking at me!"
And you walk up to the front of the tank. Then you realize that these animals all have different personalities: Some of them would hold their ground, others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks, and one in particular, this amazing animal ...
I went up to the front of the tank, and he's just staring at me, and he had little horns come up above his eyes.
So I went right up to the front of the tank -- I was three or four inches from the front glass -- and the octopus was sitting on a perch, a little rock, and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass.
So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away, and at that time I could actually focus that close; now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone.
Anyway, there we were, staring at each other, and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank from the filtration system, and -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down.
He reaches up, takes another armful of gravel, releases it -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- same thing.
Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm.
Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm.
And then I realize the octopus won the arms race, because I was out and he had six left.
But the only way I can describe what I was seeing that day was that this octopus was playing, which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate.
So, about three years into my degree, a funny thing happened on the way to the office, which actually changed the course of my life.
A man came into the aquarium. It's a long story, but essentially he sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacific to collect animals for him, and as we left, he gave us two 16-millimeter movie cameras.
He said, "Make a movie about this expedition."
"OK, a couple of biologists making a movie -- this'll be interesting," and off we went. And we did, we made a movie, which had to be the worst movie ever made in the history of movie making, but it was a blast. I had so much fun.
And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head, thinking, "Wait a minute.
Maybe I can do this all the time.
Yeah, I'll be a filmmaker."
So I literally came back from that job, quit school, hung my filmmaking shingle and just never told anyone that I didn't know what I was doing.
It's been a good ride.
And what I learned in school though was really beneficial.
If you're a wildlife filmmaker and you're going out into the field to film animals, especially behavior, it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are, how they work and, you know, a bit about their behaviors.
But where I really learned about octopus was in the field, as a filmmaker making films with them, where you're allowed to spend large periods of time with the animals, seeing octopus being octopus in their ocean homes.
I remember I took a trip to Australia, went to an island called One Tree Island.
And apparently, evolution had occurred at a pretty rapid rate on One Tree, between the time they named it and the time I arrived, because I'm sure there were at least three trees on that island when we were there.
Anyway, one tree is situated right next to a beautiful coral reef.
In fact, there's a surge channel where the tide is moving back and forth, twice a day, pretty rapidly.
And there's a beautiful reef, very complex reef, with lots of animals, including a lot of octopus.
And not uniquely but certainly, the octopus in Australia are masters at camouflage.
there's one right there.
So our first challenge was to find these things, and that was a challenge, indeed.
But the idea is, we were there for a month and I wanted to acclimate the animals to us so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them.
So the first week was pretty much spent just getting as close as we could, every day a little closer, a little closer, a little closer.
And you knew what the limit was: they would start getting twitchy and you'd back up, come back in a few hours.
And after the first week, they ignored us.
It was like, "I don't know what that thing is, but he's no threat to me."
So they went on about their business and from a foot away, we're watching mating and courting and fighting and it is just an unbelievable experience.
And one of the most fantastic displays that I remember, or at least visually, was a foraging behavior.
And they had a lot of different techniques that they would use for foraging, but this particular one used vision.
And they would see a coral head, maybe 10 feet away, and start moving over toward that coral head.
And I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it, or imagined that one might be, but whatever the case, they would leap off the bottom and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head, and then the web between the arms would completely engulf the coral head, and they would fish out, swim for crabs.
And as soon as the crabs touched the arm, it was lights out.
And I always wondered what happened under that web.
So we created a way to find out, and I got my first look at that famous beak in action.
It was fantastic.
If you're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals, you might as well pick one that's fairly common.
And octopus are, they live in all the oceans.
They also live deep.
And I can't say octopus are responsible for my really strong interest in getting in subs and going deep, but whatever the case, I like that.
It's like nothing you've ever done.
If you ever really want to get away from it all and see something that you have never seen, and have an excellent chance of seeing something no one has ever seen, get in a sub.
You climb in, seal the hatch, turn on a little oxygen, turn on the scrubber, which removes the CO2 in the air you breathe, and they chuck you overboard.
Down you go. There's no connection to the surface apart from a pretty funky radio.
And as you go down, the washing machine at the surface calms down.
And it gets quiet.
And it starts getting really nice.
And as you go deeper, that lovely, blue water you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue.
And finally, it's a rich lavender, and after a couple of thousand feet, it's ink black.
And now you've entered the realm of the mid-water community.
You could give an entire talk about the creatures that live in the mid-water.
Suffice to say though, as far as I'm concerned, without question, the most bizarre designs and outrageous behaviors are in the animals that live in the mid-water community.
But we're just going to zip right past this area, this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-ocean ridge, which I think is even more extraordinary.
The mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range, 40,000 miles long, snaking around the entire globe.
And they're big mountains, thousands of feet tall, some of which are tens of thousands of feet and bust through the surface, creating islands like Hawaii.
And the top of this mountain range is splitting apart, creating a rift valley.
And when you dive into that rift valley, that's where the action is because literally thousands of active volcanoes are going off at any point in time all along this 40,000 mile range.
And as these tectonic plates are spreading apart, magma, lava is coming up and filling those gaps, and you're looking land -- new land -- being created right before your eyes.
And over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water creating enormous pressure, forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth, until it hits a magma chamber where it becomes superheated and supersaturated with minerals, reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone.
In fact, this whole area is like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings.
And this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F.
The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing.
So it immediately cools, and it can no longer hold in suspension all of the material that it's dissolved, and it precipitates out, forming black smoke.
And it forms these towers, these chimneys that are 10, 20, 30 feet tall.
And all along the sides of these chimneys is shimmering with heat and loaded with life.
You've got black smokers going all over the place and chimneys that have tube worms that might be eight to 10 feet long.
And out of the tops of these tube worms are these beautiful red plumes.
And living amongst the tangle of tube worms is an entire community of animals: shrimp, fish, lobsters, crab, clams and swarms of arthropods that are playing that dangerous game between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold.
And this whole ecosystem wasn't even known about until 33 years ago.
And it completely threw science on its head.
It made scientists rethink where life on Earth might have actually begun.
And before the discovery of these vents, all life on Earth, the key to life on Earth, was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis.
But down there, there is no sun, there is no photosynthesis; it's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it, and it's all so ephemeral.
You might film this unbelievable hydrothermal vent, which you think at the time has to be on another planet.
It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth; it looks like aliens in an alien environment.
But you go back to the same vent eight years later and it can be completely dead.
There's no hot water.
All of the animals are gone, they're dead, and the chimneys are still there creating a really nice ghost town, an eerie, spooky ghost town, but essentially devoid of animals, of course.
But 10 miles down the ridge...
pshhh! There's another volcano going.
And there's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed.
And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities is going on every 30 or 40 years all along the ridge.
And that ephemeral nature of the hydrothermal vent community isn't really different from some of the areas that I've seen in 35 years of traveling around, making films.
Where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay.
And you go back, and I'm at home, and I'm thinking, "Okay, what can I shoot ...
Ah! I know where I can shoot that.
There's this beautiful bay, lots of soft corals and stomatopods."
And you show up, and it's dead.
There's no coral, algae growing on it, and the water's pea soup.
You think, "Well, what happened?"
And you turn around, and there's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in, and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth.
And over here there's a golf course going in.
And this is the tropics.
It's raining like crazy here.
So this rainwater is flooding down the hillside, carrying with it sediments from the construction site, smothering the coral and killing it.
And fertilizers and pesticides are flowing into the bay from the golf course -- the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals, fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom -- and there's your pea soup.
But, encouragingly, I've seen just the opposite.
I've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay.
And I looked at it, just said, "Yuck," and go and work on the other side of the island.
Five years later, come back, and that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful.
It's got living coral, fish all over the place, crystal clear water, and you go, "How did that happen?"
Well, how it happened is the local community galvanized.
They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it; enacted laws and made permits required to do responsible construction and golf course maintenance and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay, and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay, and the bay recovered.
The ocean has an amazing ability to recover, if we'll just leave it alone.
I think Margaret Mead said it best.
She said that a small group of thoughtful people could change the world.
Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.
And a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay.
I'm a big fan of grassroots organizations.
I've been to a lot of lectures where, at the end of it, inevitably, one of the first questions that comes up is, "But, but what can I do?
I'm an individual. I'm one person.
And these problems are so large and global, and it's just overwhelming."
Fair enough question.
My answer to that is don't look at the big, overwhelming issues of the world.
Look in your own backyard.
Look in your heart, actually.
What do you really care about that isn't right where you live?
And fix it.
Create a healing zone in your neighborhood and encourage others to do the same.
And maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map, little dots on a map.
And in fact, the way that we can communicate today -- where Alaska is instantly knowing what's going on in China, and the Kiwis did this, and then over in England they tried to ...
and everybody is talking to everyone else -- it's not isolated points on a map anymore, it's a network we've created.
And maybe these healing zones can start growing, and possibly even overlap, and good things can happen.
So that's how I answer that question.
Look in your own backyard, in fact, look in the mirror.
What can you do that is more responsible than what you're doing now?
And do that, and spread the word.
The vent community animals can't really do much about the life and death that's going on where they live, but up here we can.
In theory, we're thinking, rational human beings.
And we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment, like those people changed the health of that bay.
Now, Sylvia's TED Prize wish was to beseech us to do anything we could, everything we could, to set aside not pin pricks, but significant expanses of the ocean for preservation, "hope spots," she calls them.
And I applaud that. I loudly applaud that.
And it's my hope that some of these "hope spots" can be in the deep ocean, an area that has historically been seriously neglected, if not abused.
The term "deep six" comes to mind: "If it's too big or too toxic for a landfill, deep six it!"
So, I hope that we can also keep some of these "hope spots" in the deep sea.
Now, I don't get a wish, but I certainly can say that I will do anything I can to support Sylvia Earle's wish.
And that I do.
Thank you very much.

I was afraid of womanhood.
Not that I'm not afraid now, but I've learned to pretend.
I've learned to be flexible.
In fact, I've developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear.
Let me explain.
Back in the '50s and '60s, when I was growing up, little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft, and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy -- really not quite clear what we were supposed to be.
There were plenty of role models all around us.
We had our mothers, our aunts, our cousins, our sisters, and of course, the ever-present media bombarding us with images and words, telling us how to be.
Now my mother was different.
She was a homemaker, but she and I didn't go out and do girlie things together, and she didn't buy me pink outfits.
Instead, she knew what I needed, and she bought me a book of cartoons.
And I just ate it up.
I drew, and I drew, and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family, I could draw, do what I wanted to do, and not have to perform, not have to speak -- I was very shy -- and I could still get approval.
I was launched as a cartoonist.
Now when we're young, we don't always know. We know there are rules out there, but we don't always know -- we don't perform them right, even though we are imprinted at birth with these things, and we're told what the most important color in the world is.
We're told what shape we're supposed to be in.
We're told what to wear -- -- and how to do our hair -- -- and how to behave.
Now the rules that I'm talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture.
We're being corrected, and the primary policemen are women, because we are the carriers of the tradition.
We pass it down from generation to generation.
Not only that -- we always have this vague notion that something's expected of us.
And on top of all off these rules, they keep changing.
We don't know what's going on half the time, so it puts us in a very tenuous position.
Now if you don't like these rules, and many of us don't -- I know I didn't, and I still don't, even though I follow them half the time, not quite aware that I'm following them -- what better way than to change them [than] with humor?
Humor relies on the traditions of a society.
It takes what we know, and it twists it.
It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress, and it makes it unexpected, and that's what elicits a laugh.
Now what if you put together women and humor?
I think you can get change.
Because women are on the ground floor, and we know the traditions so well, we can bring a different voice to the table.
Now I started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos.
I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C.
during the Civil Rights movement, the assassinations, the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement, and I think I was drawing, trying to figure out what was going on.
And then also my family was in chaos, and I drew to try to bring my family together -- -- try to bring my family together with laughter.
It didn't work.
My parents got divorced, and my sister was arrested.
But I found my place.
I found that I didn't have to wear high heels, I didn't have to wear pink, and I could feel like I fit in.
Now when I was a little older, in my 20s, I realized there are not many women in cartooning.
And I thought, "Well, maybe I can break the little glass ceiling of cartooning," and so I did. I became a cartoonist.
And then I thought -- in my 40s I started thinking, "Well, why don't I do something?
I always loved political cartoons, so why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following as well as laugh?"
Now my perspective is a particularly -- -- my perspective is a particularly American perspective.
I can't help it. I live here.
Even though I've traveled a lot, I still think like an American woman.
But I believe that the rules that I'm talking about are universal, of course -- that each culture has its different codes of behavior and dress and traditions, and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the U.S.
Consequently, we have.
Women, because we're on the ground, we know the tradition.
We have amazing antennae.
Now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists, which I so enjoy, and it's given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth, to get at the issues quickly and succinctly.
And not only that, it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect, but through the heart.
My work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world -- countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Argentina, France -- and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties.
And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard in some very difficult circumstances.
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them.
And we talk about how women have such strong perceptions, because of our tenuous position and our role as tradition-keepers, that we can have the great potential to be change-agents.
And I think, I truly believe, that we can change this thing one laugh at a time.
Thank you.

Cities are the crucible of civilization.
They have been expanding, urbanization has been expanding, at an exponential rate in the last 200 years so that by the second part of this century, the planet will be completely dominated by cities.
Cities are the origins of global warming, impact on the environment, health, pollution, disease, finance, economies, energy -- they're all problems that are confronted by having cities.
That's where all these problems come from.
And the tsunami of problems that we feel we're facing in terms of sustainability questions are actually a reflection of the exponential increase in urbanization across the planet.
Here's some numbers.
Two hundred years ago, the United States was less than a few percent urbanized.
It's now more than 82 percent.
The planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago.
China's building 300 new cities in the next 20 years.
Now listen to this: Every week for the foreseeable future, until 2050, every week more than a million people are being added to our cities.
This is going to affect everything.
Everybody in this room, if you stay alive, is going to be affected by what's happening in cities in this extraordinary phenomenon.
However, cities, despite having this negative aspect to them, are also the solution.
Because cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets that have sucked up creative people, creating ideas, innovation, wealth and so on.
So we have this kind of dual nature.
And so there's an urgent need for a scientific theory of cities.
Now these are my comrades in arms.
This work has been done with an extraordinary group of people, and they've done all the work, and I'm the great bullshitter that tries to bring it all together.
The 10 billion people on the planet in 2050 want to live in places like this, having things like this, doing things like this, with economies that are growing like this, not realizing that entropy produces things like this, this, this and this.
And the question is: are going to look like in 2050, or is it going to be this?
That's the question.
I must say, many of the indicators look like this is what it's going to look like, but let's talk about it.
So my provocative statement is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities.
And scientific theory means quantifiable -- relying on underlying generic principles that can be made into a predictive framework.
That's the quest.
Is that conceivable?
Are there universal laws?
So here's two questions that I have in my head when I think about this problem.
The first is: Are cities part of biology?
Is London a great big whale?
Is Edinburgh a horse?
Is Microsoft a great big anthill?
What do we learn from that?
We use them metaphorically -- the DNA of a company, the metabolism of a city, and so on -- is that just bullshit, metaphorical bullshit, or is there serious substance to it?
And if that is the case, how come that it's very hard to kill a city?
You could drop an atom bomb on a city, and 30 years later it's surviving.
Very few cities fail.
All companies die, all companies.
And if you have a serious theory, you should be able to predict when Google is going to go bust.
So is that just another version of this?
Well we understand this very well.
That is, you ask any generic question about this -- how many trees of a given size, how many branches of a given size does a tree have, how many leaves, what is the energy flowing through each branch, what is the size of the canopy, what is its growth, what is its mortality?
We have a mathematical framework based on generic universal principles that can answer those questions.
And the idea is can we do the same for this?
So the route in is recognizing one of the most extraordinary things about life, is that it is scalable, it works over an extraordinary range.
This is just a tiny range actually: It's us mammals; we're one of these.
The same principles, the same dynamics, the same organization is at work in all of these, including us, and it can scale over a range of 100 million in size.
And that is one of the main reasons life is so resilient and robust -- scalability.
We're going to discuss that in a moment more.
But you know, at a local level, you scale; everybody in this room is scaled.
That's called growth.
Here's how you grew.
Rat, that's a rat -- could have been you.
We're all pretty much the same.
And you see, you're very familiar with this.
You grow very quickly and then you stop.
And that line there is a prediction from the same theory, based on the same principles, that describes that forest.
And here it is for the growth of a rat, and those points on there are data points.
This is just the weight versus the age.
And you see, it stops growing.
Very, very good for biology -- also one of the reasons for its great resilience.
Very, very bad for economies and companies and cities in our present paradigm.
This is what we believe.
This is what our whole economy is thrusting upon us, particularly illustrated in that left-hand corner: hockey sticks.
This is a bunch of software companies -- and what it is is their revenue versus their age -- all zooming away, and everybody making millions and billions of dollars.
Okay, so how do we understand this?
So let's first talk about biology.
This is explicitly showing you how things scale, and this is a truly remarkable graph.
What is plotted here is metabolic rate -- how much energy you need per day to stay alive -- versus your weight, your mass, for all of us bunch of organisms.
And it's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of 10, otherwise you couldn't get everything on the graph.
And what you see if you plot it in this slightly curious way is that everybody lies on the same line.
Despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe, there's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this.
It's particularly astonishing because each one of these organisms, each subsystem, each cell type, each gene, has evolved in its own unique environmental niche with its own unique history.
And yet, despite all of that Darwinian evolution and natural selection, they've been constrained to lie on a line.
Something else is going on.
Before I talk about that, I've written down at the bottom there the slope of this curve, this straight line.
It's three-quarters, roughly, which is less than one -- and we call that sublinear.
And here's the point of that.
It says that, if it were linear, the steepest slope, then doubling the size you would require double the amount of energy.
But it's sublinear, and what that translates into is that, if you double the size of the organism, you actually only need 75 percent more energy.
So a wonderful thing about all of biology is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale.
The bigger you are systematically, according to very well-defined rules, less energy per capita.
Now any physiological variable you can think of, any life history event you can think of, if you plot it this way, looks like this.
There is an extraordinary regularity.
So you tell me the size of a mammal, I can tell you at the 90 percent level everything about it in terms of its physiology, life history, etc.
And the reason for this is because of networks.
All of life is controlled by networks -- from the intracellular through the multicellular through the ecosystem level.
And you're very familiar with these networks.
That's a little thing that lives inside an elephant.
And here's the summary of what I'm saying.
If you take those networks, this idea of networks, and you apply universal principles, mathematizable, universal principles, all of these scalings and all of these constraints follow, including the description of the forest, the description of your circulatory system, the description within cells.
One of the things I did not stress in that introduction was that, systematically, the pace of life decreases as you get bigger.
Heart rates are slower; you live longer; diffusion of oxygen and resources across membranes is slower, etc.
The question is: Is any of this true for cities and companies?
So is London a scaled up Birmingham, which is a scaled up Brighton, etc., etc.?
Is New York a scaled up San Francisco, which is a scaled up Santa Fe?
Don't know. We will discuss that.
But they are networks, and the most important network of cities is you.
Cities are just a physical manifestation of your interactions, our interactions, and the clustering and grouping of individuals.
Here's just a symbolic picture of that.
And here's scaling of cities.
This shows that in this very simple example, which happens to be a mundane example of number of petrol stations as a function of size -- plotted in the same way as the biology -- you see exactly the same kind of thing.
There is a scaling.
That is that the number of petrol stations in the city is now given to you when you tell me its size.
The slope of that is less than linear.
There is an economy of scale.
Less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are -- not surprising.
But here's what's surprising.
It scales in the same way everywhere.
This is just European countries, but you do it in Japan or China or Colombia, always the same with the same kind of economy of scale to the same degree.
And any infrastructure you look at -- whether it's the length of roads, length of electrical lines -- anything you look at has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way.
It's an integrated system that has evolved despite all the planning and so on.
But even more surprising is if you look at socio-economic quantities, quantities that have no analog in biology, that have evolved when we started forming communities eight to 10,000 years ago.
The top one is wages as a function of size plotted in the same way.
And the bottom one is you lot -- super-creatives plotted in the same way.
And what you see is a scaling phenomenon.
But most important in this, the exponent, the analog to that three-quarters for the metabolic rate, is bigger than one -- it's about 1.15 to 1.2.
Here it is, which says that the bigger you are the more you have per capita, unlike biology -- higher wages, more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger, more patents per capita, more crime per capita.
And we've looked at everything: more AIDS cases, flu, etc.
And here, they're all plotted together.
Just to show you what we plotted, here is income, GDP -- GDP of the city -- crime and patents all on one graph.
And you can see, they all follow the same line.
And here's the statement.
If you double the size of a city from 100,000 to 200,000, from a million to two million, 10 to 20 million, it doesn't matter, then systematically you get a 15 percent increase in wages, wealth, number of AIDS cases, number of police, anything you can think of.
It goes up by 15 percent, and you have a 15 percent savings on the infrastructure.
This, no doubt, is the reason why a million people a week are gathering in cities.
Because they think that all those wonderful things -- like creative people, wealth, income -- is what attracts them, forgetting about the ugly and the bad.
What is the reason for this?
Well I don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics, but underlying this is the social networks, because this is a universal phenomenon.
This 15 percent rule is true no matter where you are on the planet -- Japan, Chile, Portugal, Scotland, doesn't matter.
Always, all the data shows it's the same, despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently.
Something universal is going on.
The universality, to repeat, is us -- that we are the city.
And it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions.
So there it is, I've said it again.
So if it is those networks and their mathematical structure, unlike biology, which had sublinear scaling, economies of scale, you had the slowing of the pace of life as you get bigger.
If it's social networks with super-linear scaling -- more per capita -- then the theory says that you increase the pace of life.
The bigger you are, life gets faster.
On the left is the heart rate showing biology.
On the right is the speed of walking in a bunch of European cities, showing that increase.
Lastly, I want to talk about growth.
This is what we had in biology, just to repeat.
Economies of scale gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior.
You grow fast and then stop -- part of our resilience.
That would be bad for economies and cities.
And indeed, one of the wonderful things about the theory is that if you have super-linear scaling from wealth creation and innovation, then indeed you get, from the same theory, a beautiful rising exponential curve -- lovely.
And in fact, if you compare it to data, it fits very well with the development of cities and economies.
But it has a terrible catch, and the catch is that this system is destined to collapse.
And it's destined to collapse for many reasons -- kind of Malthusian reasons -- that you run out of resources.
And how do you avoid that? Well we've done it before.
What we do is, as we grow and we approach the collapse, a major innovation takes place and we start over again, and we start over again as we approach the next one, and so on.
So there's this continuous cycle of innovation that is necessary in order to sustain growth and avoid collapse.
The catch, however, to this is that you have to innovate faster and faster and faster.
So the image is that we're not only on a treadmill that's going faster, but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster.
We have to accelerate on a continuous basis.
And the question is: Can we, as socio-economic beings, avoid a heart attack?
So lastly, I'm going to finish up in this last minute or two asking about companies.
See companies, they scale.
The top one, in fact, is Walmart on the right.
It's the same plot.
This happens to be income and assets versus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees.
We could use sales, anything you like.
There it is: after some little fluctuations at the beginning, when companies are innovating, they scale beautifully.
And we've looked at 23,000 companies in the United States, may I say.
And I'm only showing you a little bit of this.
What is astonishing about companies is that they scale sublinearly like biology, indicating that they're dominated, not by super-linear innovation and ideas; they become dominated by economies of scale.
In that interpretation, by bureaucracy and administration, and they do it beautifully, may I say.
So if you tell me the size of some company, some small company, I could have predicted the size of Walmart.
If it has this sublinear scaling, the theory says we should have sigmoidal growth.
There's Walmart. Doesn't look very sigmoidal.
That's what we like, hockey sticks.
But you notice, I've cheated, because I've only gone up to '94.
Let's go up to 2008.
That red line is from the theory.
So if I'd have done this in 1994, I could have predicted what Walmart would be now.
And then this is repeated across the entire spectrum of companies.
There they are. That's 23,000 companies.
They all start looking like hockey sticks, they all bend over, and they all die like you and me.
Thank you.

<title>Geoffrey West: The surprising math of cities and corporations</title>
<description>Physicist Geoffrey West has found that simple, mathematical laws govern the properties of cities -- that wealth, crime rate, walking speed and many other aspects of a city can be deduced from a single number: the city's population. In this mind-bending talk from TEDGlobal he shows how it works and how similar laws hold for organisms and corporations.</description>

I have been teaching for a long time, and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students.
In 1931, my grandmother -- bottom left for you guys over here -- graduated from the eighth grade.
She went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived.
It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head; and she needed to go there to get the information, because that's how you learned.
Fast-forward a generation: this is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove, where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse.
And he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher, stored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head, and take it with him, because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world.
When I was a kid, we had a set of encyclopedias at my house.
It was purchased the year I was born, and it was extraordinary, because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.
The information was inside my house and it was awesome.
This was different than either generation had experienced before, and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level.
But the information was closer to me.
I could get access to it.
In the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching, we really see the advent of the Internet.
Right about the time that the Internet gets going as an educational tool, I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas, small town Kansas, where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely, small-town, rural Kansas school district, where I was teaching my favorite subject, American government.
My first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach American government, loved the political system.
Kids in the 12th grade: not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system.
Year two: learned a few things -- had to change my tactic.
And I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves.
I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it.
I posed a problem in front of them, which was to put on an election forum for their own community.
They produced fliers. They called offices.
They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries.
They produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates.
They invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well, and really had this robust experiential learning.
The older teachers -- more experienced -- looked at me and went, "Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done."
"She doesn't know what she's in for."
But I knew that the kids would show up, and I believed it, and I told them every week what I expected out of them.
And that night, all 90 kids -- dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it.
I had to just sit and watch.
It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic.
It meant something to them.
And they will step up.
From Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona, where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years, this time with middle school students.
Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government.
Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography.
Again, "thrilled" to learn.
But what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona, was I had this really in a truly public school, and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities.
And one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina, which is the gentleman that the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after.
And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us.
We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses.
There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip.
The problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful, and they know what to do with it.
And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive.
I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world, that they could identify that had done a similar thing.
I asked them to produce a little movie about it.
It's the first time we'd done this.
Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer, but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it.
It was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves, what they're willing to share.
The last question of the assignment is: how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people?
The things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary.
Fast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today.
I teach at the Science Leadership Academy, which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the school district of Philadelphia.
We are a nine through 12 public school, but we do school quite differently.
I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned, and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past, of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school, and to a moment when we have information surplus.
So what do you do when the information is all around you?
Why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information?
In Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program, so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday, taking them home, getting access to information.
And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students, is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process.
We deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test, and I am here to share with you: it is not learning.
That is the absolute wrong thing to ask, to tell kids to never be wrong.
To ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn.
So we did this project, and this is one of the artifacts of the project.
I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure.
My students produced these info-graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill.
I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info-graphics that existed in a lot of mass media, and take a look at what were the interesting components of it, and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from American history.
And they had certain criteria to do it.
They were a little uncomfortable with it, because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it.
They can talk -- they're very smooth, and they can write very, very well, but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them.
But I gave them the room to just do the thing.
Go create. Go figure it out.
Let's see what we can do.
And the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint.
This was done in like two or three days.
And this is the work of the student that consistently did it.
And when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?"
And they immediately went, "There it is."
Didn't read anything. "There it is."
And I said, "Well what makes it great?"
And they're like, "Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color.
And there's some ... " And they went through all that we processed out loud.
And I said, "Go read it."
And they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome."
And then we went to another one -- it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information -- and spent an hour talking about the learning process, because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect, or whether or not it was what I could create.
It asked them to create for themselves, and it allowed them to fail, process, learn from.
And when we do another round of this in my class this year, they will do better this time, because learning has to include an amount of failure, because failure is instructional in the process.
There are a million pictures that I could click through here, and had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites -- of students learning, of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information, but instead, ask them what they can do with it.
Ask them really interesting questions.
They will not disappoint.
Ask them to go to places, to see things for themselves, to actually experience the learning, to play, to inquire.
This is one of my favorite photos, because this was taken on Tuesday, when I asked the students to go to the polls.
This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting, and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that.
But this is learning too, because we asked them to go out into real spaces.
The main point is that, if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning, empowering student voice and embracing failure, we're missing the mark.
And everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities, because we won't get there with a standardized test, and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer.
We know how to do this better, and it's time to do better.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/alan_russell_on_regenerating_our_bodies.html</url>
I'm going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope.
When we go to the physician today -- when we go to the doctor's office and we walk in, there are words that we just don't want to hear.
There are words that we're truly afraid of.
Diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, heart failure, lung failure -- things that we know are debilitating diseases, for which there's relatively little that can be done.
And what I want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease, why it's important, why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already hasn't, and where we are clinically today, and where we might go tomorrow, and what some of the hurdles are.
And we're going to do all of that in 18 minutes, I promise.
I want to start with this slide, because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it.
This was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human.
It was basically a regenerative medicine issue.
Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand.
It's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale.
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there.
We know that if we have a damaged hip, you can put an artificial hip in.
And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover.
This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine.
This is not regenerative medicine.
Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago.
The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like -- and I'll come back to that theme a few times -- instead of doing that, we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue.
So that at the end of the treatment, you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment.
Very few good ideas -- if you agree that this is a good idea -- very few good ideas are truly novel.
And this is just the same.
If you look back in history, Charles Lindbergh, who was better known for flying airplanes, was actually one of the first people along with Alexis Carrel, one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller, to begin to think about, could you culture organs?
And they published this book in 1937, where they actually began to think about, what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs?
We've come a long way since then.
I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on.
But before doing that, what I'd like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you.
Many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life, and reducing poverty, and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe.
One of the challenges is that the richer we are, the longer we live.
And the longer we live, the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older.
This is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population over the age of 65.
And you can basically see that the richer a country is, the older the people are within it.
Why is this important?
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now?
If the average age of your population is 30, then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again, maybe a little bit of asthma.
If the average age in your country is 45 to 55, now the average person is looking at diabetes, early-onset diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery disease -- things that are inherently more difficult to treat, and much more expensive to treat.
Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here.
This is from "The Untied States of America."
In 1930, there were 41 workers per retiree.
41 people who were basically outside of being really sick, paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease.
In 2010, two workers per retiree in the U.S.
And this is matched in every industrialized, wealthy country in the world.
How can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this?
This is age versus cost of health care.
And you can see that right around age 45, 40 to 45, there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care.
It's actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies, you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care, plotted over your lifetime.
And about seven years before you're about to die, there's a spike.
And you can actually -- -- we won't get into that.
There are very few things, very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what I would call healthy aging.
I'd suggest there are four things, and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system.
All those things do is change who pays.
They don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is.
One thing you can do is not treat. You can ration health care.
We won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing.
You can prevent.
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention.
But perhaps most interesting, to me anyway, and most important, is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression, and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom.
Think of it in terms of diabetes, for instance.
Today, with diabetes, what do we do?
We diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic, and then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.
And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy.
But eventually it stops working, and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease.
Why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease, perhaps even before it was symptomatic?
And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it, but if it worked, we would truly be able to do something different.
This video, I think, gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically.
This is a newt re-growing its limb.
If a newt can do this kind of thing, why can't we?
I'll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment.
But what we're talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body, for tissues and for organs themselves.
So today's reality is that if we get sick, the message is we will treat your symptoms, and you need to adjust to a new way of life.
I would pose to you that tomorrow -- and when tomorrow is we could debate, but it's within the foreseeable future -- we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation.
There's a limb prosthetic up here, similar actually one on the soldier that's come back from Iraq.
There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs.
Imagine if instead of facing that, they could actually face the regeneration of that limb.
It's a wild concept.
I'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept.
But it's applicable, again, to every organ system.
How can we do that?
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body.
We need to learn to speak the body's language.
And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus.
A mammalian fetus, if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy, will re-grow that limb.
So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms.
It's a natural process, but it is lost as we age.
In a child, before the age of about six months, if they lose their fingertip in an accident, they'll re-grow their fingertip.
By the time they're five, they won't be able to do that anymore.
So to engage in that conversation with the body, we need to speak the body's language.
And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today.
I'm going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body.
The first is cellular therapies.
Clearly, we heal ourselves in a natural process, using cells to do most of the work.
Therefore, if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body, they may do the healing.
Secondly, we can use materials.
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials.
If we can invent materials, design materials, or extract materials from a natural environment, then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself.
And finally, we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal.
I'm going to show you an example of each of these, and I'm going to start with materials.
Steve Badylak -- who's at the University of Pittsburgh -- about a decade ago had a remarkable idea.
And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig, if you threw away all the cells, and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active, may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself.
And he asked a very important question.
He asked the question, if I take that material, which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine, and I place it somewhere else on a person's body, would it give a tissue-specific response, or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear?
I wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling.
The picture I'm about to show you However, for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish -- even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends -- the lights are down. This is a good time to look at your feet, check your Blackberry, do anything other than look at the screen.
What I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer.
And although -- it's good to laugh before we look at this.
This is the reality of diabetes.
I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics, diabetic ulcers, we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment, which is amputation, if you can't heal it.
So I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long.
This is a diabetic ulcer. It's tragic.
The treatment for this is amputation.
This is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes, and has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact.
And this lady decided, after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer, that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented.
That's what the wound looked like 11 weeks later.
That material contained only natural signals.
And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn't have before.
There's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you -- I'll let you know when you can look again.
This is a horse. The horse is not in pain.
If the horse was in pain, I wouldn't show you this slide.
The horse just has another nostril that's developed because of a riding accident.
Just a few weeks after treatment -- in this case, taking that material, turning it into a gel, and packing that area, and then repeating the treatment a few times -- and the horse heals up.
And if you took an ultrasound of that area, it would look great.
Here's a dolphin where the fin's been re-attached.
There are now 400,000 patients around the world who have used that material to heal their wounds.
Could you regenerate a limb?
DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project to begin the process of asking that question.
And I'll show you the 15 million dollar picture.
This is a 78 year-old man who's lost the end of his fingertip.
Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips.
After treatment that's what it looks like.
This is happening today.
This is clinically relevant today.
There are materials that do this. Here are the heart patches.
But could you go a little further?
Could you, say, instead of using material, can I take some cells along with the material, and remove a damaged piece of tissue, put a bio-degradable material on there?
You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish.
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital.
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish.
He chills the dish, it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish.
It's the coolest stuff.
Now I'm going to show you cell-based regeneration.
And what I'm going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient.
Again, if you're squeamish, you don't want to watch.
But this one's kind of cool.
So this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had, with a difference.
In this case, at the end of the bypass operation, you're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient.
And I'm standing up here because at one point I'm going to show you just how early this technology is.
Here go the stem cells, right into the beating heart of the patient.
And if you look really carefully, it's going to be right around this point you'll actually see a back-flush.
You see the cells coming back out.
We need all sorts of new technology, new devices, to get the cells to the right place at the right time.
Just a little bit of data, a tiny bit of data.
This was a randomized trial.
At this time this was an N of 20. Now there's an N of about 100.
Basically, if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass, they get a little bit better.
If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass, for these particular patients, they became asymptomatic.
These are now two years out.
The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early, and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state.
This is the same procedure, but now done minimally invasively, with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure.
There go the cells.
We don't have time to go into all of those details, but basically, that works too.
You can take patients who are less sick, and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy.
Here's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet, but I think very soon will be.
This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh, along with a number of colleagues around the world.
They've decided that liposuction fluid, which -- in the United States, we have a lot of liposuction fluid.
It's a great source of stem cells.
Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid.
So you could go in, you could get your tummy-tuck.
Out comes the liposuction fluid, and in this case, the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons.
All done in the lab.
And I think fairly soon, you will see patients being treated with their own fat-derived, or adipose-derived, stem cells.
I talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease.
Here's just one example before I close up.
This is equally tragic.
We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army, who have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq.
Many of those patients are very severely burned.
And if there's anything that's been learned about burn, it's that we don't know how to treat it.
Everything that is done to treat burn -- basically we do a sodding approach.
We make something over here, and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound, and we try and get the two to take.
In this case here, a new, wearable bio-reactor has been designed -- it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR -- by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh.
And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed.
The gun that you see there sprays cells.
That's going to spray cells over that area.
The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment, deliver other things as well at the same time, and therefore we will seed that lawn, as opposed to try the sodding approach.
It's a completely different way of doing it.
So my 18 minutes is up.
So let me finish up with some good news, and maybe a little bit of bad news.
The good news is that this is happening today.
It's very powerful work.
Clearly the images kind of get that across.
It's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter-disciplinary.
Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen.
A number of governments, and a number of regions, have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease.
The Japanese government were perhaps the first, when they decided to invest first 3 billion, later another 2 billion in this field.
It's no coincidence.
Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age.
They need this to work or their health system dies.
So they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area.
The European Union, same thing.
China, the same thing.
China just launched a national tissue-engineering center.
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars.
In the United States we've had a somewhat different approach.
Oh, for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president.
We've had a different approach.
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along.
But there's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way.
And I'm going to finish up with a quote, maybe a little cheap shot, at the director of the NIH, who's a very charming man.
Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago, to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 27.5 billion dollars that he's going to get next year and focus it, in a strategic way, to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients.
And at the end of a very testy meeting, what the NIH director said was, "Your vision is larger than our appetite."
I'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision, but together we can change his appetite.
Thank you.

I should tell you that when I was asked to be here, I thought to myself that well, it's TED.
And these TEDsters are -- you know, as innocent as that name sounds -- these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world.
And what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that?
And so I thought perhaps a really civilized-sounding British accent might help things a bit.
And then I thought no, no. I should just get up there and be myself and just talk the way I really talk because, after all, this is the great unveiling.
And so I thought I'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you.
Although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen's English because I am from Queens, New York.
But the theme of this session, of course, is invention.
And while I don't have any patents that I'm aware of, you will be meeting a few of my inventions today.
I suppose it's fair to say that I am interested in the invention of self or selves.
We're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits, unique developmental experiences, geographical and historical contexts.
But then what?
To what extent do we self-construct, do we self-invent?
How do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity?
Like, what if one could be anyone at any time?
Well my characters, like the ones in my shows, allow me to play with the spaces between those questions.
And so I've brought a couple of them with me.
And well, they're very excited.
What I should tell you -- what I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks.
So feel free to think of this as Sarah University.
Okay. Okay. Oh, well.
Oh, wonderful.
Good evening everybody.
Thank you so very much for having me here today.
Ah, thank you very much. My name is Lorraine Levine.
Oh my! There's so many of you.
Hi sweetheart. Okay.
Anyway, I am here because of a young girl, Sarah Jones.
She's a very nice, young black girl.
Well you know, she calls herself black -- she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her.
But anyway.
She has me here because she puts me in her show, what she calls her one-woman show.
And you know what that means, of course.
That means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work.
But I don't mind.
Frankly, I'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this, you know.
Really, it's amazing.
Not only, of course, the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities.
There are so many celebrities running around here.
I saw -- Glenn Close I saw earlier. I love her.
And she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe.
Isn't that adorable?
So many others you see, they're just wonderful.
It's lovely to know they're concerned, you know.
And -- oh, I saw Goldie Hawn.
Oh, Goldie Hawn. I love her, too; she's wonderful. Yeah.
You know, she's only half Jewish.
Did you know that about her?
Yeah. But even so, a wonderful talent.
And I -- you know, when I saw her, such a wonderful feeling.
Yeah, she's lovely.
But anyway, I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel.
It's such an eye-opening experience to be here.
You're all so responsible for this world that we live in today.
You know, I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl.
And you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time -- you're all so young.
You know, your parents must be very proud.
But I -- I also appreciate the diversity that you have here.
I noticed it's very multicultural.
You know, when you're standing up here, you can see all the different people.
It's like a rainbow.
It's okay to say rainbow. Yeah.
I just -- I can't keep up with whether you can say, you know, the different things.
What are you allowed to say or not say?
I just -- I don't want to offend anybody. You know.
But anyway, you know, I just think that to be here with all of you accomplished young people -- literally, some of you, the architects building our brighter future.
You know, it's heartening to me.
Even though, quite frankly, some of your presentations are horrifying, absolutely horrifying.
It's true. It's true.
You know, between the environmental degradation and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about.
And of course, we know it's all because of the -- all the ...
Well, I don't know how else to say it to you, so I'll just say it my way: the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the, you know, the bankers and the Wall Street. You know it.
Anyway.
The point is, I'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess.
So I salute each of you and your stellar achievements.
Thank you for all that you do.
And congratulations on being such big makhers that you've become TED meisters.
So, happy continued success.
Congratulations. Mazel tov.
Hi. Hi.
Thank you everybody.
Sorry, this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything, to be here right now.
My name is Noraida. And I'm just -- I'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference that you're doing and everything like that.
I am Dominican-American.
Actually, you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic, otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City.
But I don't know if there's any other Dominican people here, but I know that Juan Enriquez, he was here yesterday.
And I think he's Mexican, so that's -- honestly, that's close enough for me right now. So -- I just -- I'm sorry.
I'm just trying not to be nervous because this is a very wonderful experience for me and everything.
And I just -- you know I'm not used to doing the public speaking.
And whenever I get nervous I start to talk really fast.
Nobody can understand nothing I'm saying, which is very frustrating for me, as you can imagine.
I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath.
But then on top of that, you know, Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes.
So then I'm like, should I be nervous, you know, because maybe it's better.
And I'm just trying not to panic and freak out. So I like, take a deep breath.
Okay. Sorry. So anyway, what I was trying to say is that I really love TED.
Like, I love everything about this. It's amazing.
Like, it's -- I can't get over this right now.
And, like, people would not believe, seriously, where I'm from, that this even exists.
You know, like even, I mean I love like the name, the -- TED.
I mean I know it's a real person and everything, but I'm just saying that like, you know, I think it's very cool how it's also an acronym, you know, which is like, you know, is like very high concept and everything like that.
I like that.
And actually, I can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything.
Because, actually, I'm a sophomore at college right now.
At my school -- actually I was part of co-founding an organization, which is like a leadership thing, you know, like you guys, you would really like it and everything.
And the organization is called DA BOMB, A\and DA BOMB -- not like what you guys can build and everything -- it's like, DA BOMB, it means like Dominican -- it's an acronym -- Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies.
So, I know, see, like the name is like a little bit long, but with the war on terror and everything, the Dean of Student Activities has asked us to stop saying DA BOMB and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea, whatever.
So, basically like DA BOMB -- what Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does is, basically, we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me.
I am a working mother, and I also go to school full-time.
And, you know, it's like -- it's so important to have like role models out there.
I mean, I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different, whatever.
But like even at my job -- like, I just got promoted.
Right now it's very exciting actually for me because I'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director under the Senior Vice President for Business Development -- that's my new title.
So, but I think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me, like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning.
And if everybody, like all people really had access to that, it would be a very different world out there, as I know you know.
So, I think all people, we need that, but especially, I look at people like me, you know like, I mean, Latinos -- we're about to be the majority, in like two weeks.
So, we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else.
So, I'm very happy that you're, you know, doing this kind of thing, making the talks available online.
That's very good. I love that.
And I just -- I love you guys. I love TED.
And if you don't mind, privately now, in the future, I'm going to think of TED as an acronym for Technology, Entertainment and Dominicans.
Thank you very much.
So, that was Noraida, and just like Lorraine and everybody else you're meeting today, these are folks who are based on real people from my real life: friends, neighbors, family members.
I come from a multicultural family.
In fact, the older lady you just met: very, very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother's side.
It's a long story, believe me.
But on top of my family background, my parents also sent me to the United Nations school, where I encountered a plethora of new characters, including Alexandre, my French teacher, okay.
Well, you know, it was beginner French, that I am taking with her, you know.
And it was Madame Bousson, you know, she was very [French].
It was like, you know, she was there in the class, you know, she was kind of typically French.
You know, she was very chic, but she was very filled with ennui, you know.
And she would be there, you know, kind of talking with the class, you know, talking about the, you know, the existential futility of life, you know.
And we were only 11 years old, so it was not appropriate.
But [German].
Yes, I took German for three years, [German], and it was quite the experience because I was the only black girl in the class, even in the UN school.
Although, you know, it was wonderful.
The teacher, Herr Schtopf, he never discriminated.
Never. He always, always treated each of us, you know, equally unbearably during the class.
So, there were the teachers and then there were my friends, classmates from everywhere, many of whom are still dear friends to this day.
And they've inspired many characters as well.
For example, a friend of mine.
Well, I just wanted to quickly say good evening.
My name is Praveen Manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity.
Of course, TED, the reputation precedes itself all over the world.
But, you know, I am originally from India, and I wanted to start by telling you that once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to TED in California, originally, I was very pleased and, frankly, relieved because, you know, I am a human rights advocate.
And usually my work, it takes me to Washington D.C.
And there, I must attend these meetings, mingling with some tiresome politicians, trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown.
So, you can just imagine -- right.
So, but I'm thrilled to be joining all of you here.
I wish we had more time together, but that's for another time. Okay? Great.
And, sadly, I don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody I brought, but -- I'm trying to behave myself, it's my first time here.
But I do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize, if you saw "Bridge and Tunnel."
Uh, well, thank you.
Good evening.
My name is Pauline Ning, and first I want to tell you that I'm -- of course I am a member of the Chinese community in New York.
But when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED, I said, well, you know, first, I don't know that, you know -- before two years ago, you would not find me in front of an audience of people, much less like this because I did not like to give speeches because I feel that, as an immigrant, I do not have good English skills for speaking.
But then, I decided, just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, I try anyway.
My daughter -- my daughter wrote that, she told me, "Always start your speech with humor."
But my background -- I want to tell you story only briefly.
My husband and I, we brought our son and daughter here in 1980s to have the freedom we cannot have in China at that time.
And we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition, but it's very hard.
You know, as immigrant, I would speak Chinese to them, and they would always answer me back in English.
They love rock music, pop culture, American culture.
But when they got older, when the time comes for them to start think about getting married, that's when we expect them to realize, a little bit more, their own culture.
But that's where we had some problems.
My son, he says he is not ready to get married.
And he has a sweetheart, but she is American woman, not Chinese.
It's not that it's bad, but I told him, "What's wrong with a Chinese woman?"
But I think he will change his mind soon.
So, then I decide instead, I will concentrate on my daughter.
The daughter's marriage is very special to the mom.
But first, she said she's not interested.
She only wants to spend time with her friends.
And then at college, it's like she never came home.
And she doesn't want me to come and visit.
So I said, "What's wrong in this picture?"
So, I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend.
But she told me, "Mom, you don't have to worry about boys because I don't like them."
And I said, "Yes, men can be difficult, but all women have to get used to that."
She said, "No Mom. I mean, I don't like boys. I like girls.
I am lesbian."
So, I always teach my kids to respect American ideas, but I told my daughter that this is one exception -- -- that she is not gay, she is just confused by this American problem.
But she told me, "Mom, it's not American."
She said she is in love -- in love with a nice Chinese girl.
So, these are the words I am waiting to hear, but from my son, not my daughter.
But at first I did not know what to do.
But then, over time, I have come to understand that this is who she is.
So, even though sometimes it's still hard, I will share with you that it helps me to realize society is more tolerant, usually because of places like this, because of ideas like this, and people like you, with an open mind.
So I think maybe TED, you impact people's lives in the ways maybe even you don't realize.
So, for my daughter's sake, I thank you for your ideas worth spreading.
Thank you. Xie xie.
Good evening. My name is Habbi Belahal.
And I would like to first of all thank Sarah Jones for putting all of the pressure on the only Arab who she brought with her to be last today.
I am originally from Jordan.
And I teach comparative literature at Queens College.
It is not Harvard.
But I feel a bit like a fish out of water.
But I am very proud of my students.
And I see that a few of them did make it here to the conference.
So you will get the extra credit I promised you.
But, while I know that I may not look like the typical TED-izen, as you would say, I do like to make the point that we in global society, we are never as different as the appearances may suggest.
So, if you will indulge me, I will share quickly with you a bit of verse, which I memorized as a young girl at 16 years of age.
So, back in the ancient times.
[Arabic] And this roughly translates: "Please, let me hold your hand.
I want to hold your hand.
I want to hold your hand.
And when I touch you, I feel happy inside.
It's such a feeling that my love, I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide."
Well, so okay, but please, please, but please.
If it is sounding familiar, it is because I was at the same time in my life listening to the Beatles.
On the radio [unclear], they were very popular.
So, all of that is to say that I like to believe that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another, there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme.
And I pray that this is the way that we will self-invent, in time.
That's all, shukran. Thank you very much for the opportunity.
Okay? Great.
Thank you all very much. It was lovely.
Thank you for having me.
Thank you very, very much. I love you.
Well, you have to let me say this.
I just -- thank you.
I want to thank Chris and Jacqueline, and just everyone for having me here.
It's been a long time coming, and I feel like I'm home.
And I know I've performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere, but this is honestly one of the best audiences I've ever experienced.
The whole thing is amazing, and so don't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon.

<title>Sarah Jones: A one-woman global village</title>
<description>In this hilariously lively performance, actress Sarah Jones channels an opinionated elderly Jewish woman, a fast-talking Dominican college student and more, giving TED2009 just a sample of her spectacular character range.</description>
<keywords>New York,culture,humanity,humor,performance,storytelling,theater</keywords>
<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_skoll_makes_movies_that_make_change.html</url>
I've actually been waiting by the phone And in fact, in 2000, I was ready to talk about eBay, but no call.
In 2003, I was ready to do a talk about the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call.
In 2004, I started Participant Productions and we had a really good first year, and no call.
And finally, I get a call last year, and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams.
You've got a cruel sense of humor, TED.
When I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley, I had some misgivings.
But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood.
And, in fact, some advantages to owning your own media company.
And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley have a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.
Hollywood has its sex symbols, and the Valley has its sex symbols.
Hollywood has its rivalries, and the Valley has its rivalries.
Hollywood gathers around power tables, and the Valley gathers around power tables.
So it turned out there was a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.
But I'm actually here today to tell a story.
And part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak, he said, people think of you as a bit of an enigma, and they want to know what drives you a bit.
And what really drives me is a vision of the future that I think we all share.
It's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability.
And when we heard a lot of the presentations over the last couple of days, Ed Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey, I think we all realized how far we have to go to get to this new version of humanity that I like to call "Humanity 2.0."
And it's also something that resides in each of us, to close what I think are the two big calamities in the world today.
One is the gap in opportunity -- this gap that President Clinton last night called uneven, unfair and unsustainable -- and, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and disease and all these evils that we see around us.
But perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.
And someone, at some point, came up with this very bad idea that an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world.
And I think that's just a horrible thing.
And so chapter one really begins today, with all of us, because within each of us is the power to equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps.
And if the men and women of TED can't make a difference in the world, I don't know who can.
And for me, a lot of this started when I was younger and my family used to go camping in upstate New York.
And there really wasn't much to do there for the summer, except get beaten up by my sister or read books.
And so I used to read authors like James Michener and James Clavell and Ayn Rand.
And their stories made the world seem a very small and interconnected place.
And it struck me that if I could write stories that were about this world as being small and interconnected, that maybe I could get people interested in the issues that affected us all, and maybe engage them to make a difference.
I didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living, so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent, so I could write these stories as quickly as I could.
I then had a bit of a wake-up call when I was 14.
And my dad came home one day and announced that he had cancer, and it looked pretty bad.
And what he said was, he wasn't so much afraid that he might die, but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life.
And knock on wood, he's still alive today, many years later.
But for a young man that made a real impression on me, that one never knows how much time one really has.
So I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering.
I started a couple of businesses that I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom.
One of those businesses was a computer rental business called Micros on the Move, which is very well named, because people kept stealing the computers.
So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business, so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there.
And while I was there, I made friends with a fellow named Pierre Omidyar, who is here today. And Pierre, I apologize for this. This is a photo from the old days.
And just after I'd graduated, Pierre came to me with this idea to help people buy and sell things online with each other.
And with the wisdom of my Stanford degree, I said, "Pierre, what a stupid idea."
And needless to say, I was right.
But right after that, Pierre -- in '96, Pierre and I left our full-time jobs to build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story, you know.
The company went public two years later and is today one of the best known companies in the world.
Hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries, and so on.
But for me, personally, it was a real change.
I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto and living off their leftovers, to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources.
And I wanted to figure out how I could take the blessing of these resources and share it with the world.
And around that time, I met John Gardner, who is a remarkable man.
He was the architect of the Great Society programs under Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s.
And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do, or anyone could do, to make a difference in the long-term issues facing humanity.
And John said, "Bet on good people doing good things.
Bet on good people doing good things."
And that really resonated with me.
I started a foundation to bet on these good people doing good things.
These leading, innovative, nonprofit folks, who are using business skills in a very leveraged way to solve social problems.
People today we call social entrepreneurs.
And to put a face on it, people like Muhammad Yunus, who started the Grameen Bank, has lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world, won the Nobel Peace Prize.
But there's also a lot of people that you don't know.
Folks like Ann Cotton, who started a group called CAMFED in Africa, because she felt girls' education was lagging.
And she started it about 10 years ago, and today, she educates over a quarter million African girls.
And somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale, who started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company, and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis, also known as black fever.
And by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease, which is really a scourge in the developing world.
And so this is one way to bet on good people doing good things.
And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change that I find really is powerful.
It's what we call, "Invest, connect and celebrate."
And invest: if you see good people doing good things, invest in them. Invest in their organizations, or in business. Invest in these folks.
Connecting them together through conferences -- like a TED -- brings so many powerful connections, or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship that my foundation does at Oxford every year.
And celebrate them: tell their stories, because not only are there good people doing good work, but their stories can help close these gaps of hope.
And it was this last part of the mission, the celebrate part, that really got me back to thinking when I was a kid and wanted to tell stories to get people involved in the issues that affect us all.
And a light bulb went off, which was, first, that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers.
And then the next light bulb was, better than just writing, what about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way?
And I thought about the films that inspired me, films like "Gandhi" and "Schindler's List."
And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today.
And there really wasn't a specific company that was focused on the public interest.
So, in 2003, I started to make my way around Los Angeles to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company and I was met with a lot of encouragement.
One of the lines of encouragement that I heard over and over was, "The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you, who think you're going to come to this town and make movies."
And then of course, there was the other adage.
"The surest way to become a millionaire is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business."
Undeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productions with the vision to be a global media company focused on the public interest.
And our mission is to produce entertainment that creates and inspires social change.
And we don't just want people to see our movies and say, that was fun, and forget about it.
We want them to actually get involved in the issues.
In 2005, we launched our first slate of films, "Murder Ball," "North Country," "Syriana" and "Good Night and Good Luck."
And much to my surprise, they were noticed.
We ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films.
And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy.
Perhaps more importantly, tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs and the activism programs that we created to go around the movies.
And we had an online component of that, our community sect called Participate.net.
But with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and the Sierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film, there was actually something they could do to make a difference.
One of these films in particular, called "North Country," was actually kind of a box office disaster.
But it was a film that starred Charlize Theron and it was about women's rights, women's empowerment, domestic violence and so on.
And we released the film at the same time that the Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act.
And with screenings on the Hill, and discussions, and with our social sector partners, like the National Organization of Women, the film was widely credited with influencing the successful renewal of the act.
And that to me, spoke volumes, because it's -- the film started about a true-life story about a woman who was harassed, sued her employer, led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act, and the Violence Against Women Act and others.
And then the movie about this person doing these things, then led to this greater renewal.
And so again, it goes back to betting on good people doing good things.
Speaking of which, our fellow TEDster, Al -- I first saw Al do his slide show presentation on global warming in May of 2005.
At that point, I thought I knew something about global warming.
I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem.
And after we saw his slide show, it became clear that it was much more urgent.
And so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, and with Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David, and Davis Guggenheim, who was running documentaries for Participant at the time.
And with Al's blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film, because we felt that we could get the message out there far more quickly than having Al go around the world, speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time.
And you know, there's another adage in Hollywood, that nobody knows nothing about anything.
And I really thought this was going to be a straight-to-PBS charitable initiative.
And so it was a great shock to all of us when the film really captured the public interest, and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland, and most of Scandinavia.
We've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.
and it's really changed the debate on global warming.
It was also a pretty good year for this guy.
We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming.
And for Participant, this is just the start.
Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world.
And we have 10 films in production right now, and dozens others in development.
I'll quickly talk about a few coming up.
One is "Charlie Wilson's War," with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.
And it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, and how he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.
And we're also doing a movie called "The Kite Runner," based on the book "The Kite Runner," also about Afghanistan.
And we think once people see these films, they'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world and the Middle East in general.
We premiered a film called "The Chicago 10" at Sundance this year.
It's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in 1968, Abby Hoffman and crew, and, again, a story about a small group of individuals who did make change in the world.
And a documentary that we're doing on Jimmy Carter and his Mid-East peace efforts over the years.
And in particular, we've been following him on his recent book tour, which, as many of you know, has been very non-controversial -- -- which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie.
In closing, I'd like to say that everybody has the opportunity to make change in their own way.
And all the people in this room have done so through their business lives, or their philanthropic work, or their other interests.
And one thing that I've learned is that there's never one right way to make change.
One can do it as a tech person, or as a finance person, or a nonprofit person, or as an entertainment person, but every one of us is all of those things and more.
And I believe if we do these things, we can close the opportunity gaps, we can close the hope gaps.
And I can imagine, if we do this, the headlines in 10 years might read something like these: "New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero," "U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil" -- -- "Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate 10 Years of Peaceful Coexistence."
And I like this one, "Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro."
And finally, an eBay listing for one well-traveled slide show, now obsolete, museum piece. Please contact Al Gore.
And I believe that, working together, we can make all of these things happen.
And I want to thank you all for having me here today.
It's been a real honor. Thank you.
Oh, thank you.

<title>Jeff Skoll: My journey into movies that matter</title>
<description>Film producer Jeff Skoll talks about his film company, Participant Productions, and the people who've inspired him to do good.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/dr_seyi_oyesola_tours_a_hospital_in_nigeria.html</url>
Just to put everything in context, and to kind of give you a background to where I'm coming from, so that a lot of the things I'm going to say, and the things I'm going to do -- or things I'm going to tell you I've done -- you will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am.
I graduated high school in Cleveland, Ohio, 1975.
And just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad, we went back home.
Finished university education, got a medical degree, 1986.
And by the time I was an intern house officer, I could barely afford to maintain my mother's 13-year-old car -- and I was a paid doctor.
This brings us to why a lot of us, who are professionals, are now, as they say, in diaspora.
Now, are we going to make that a permanent thing, where we all get trained, and we leave, and we don't go back?
Perhaps not, I should certainly hope not -- because that is not my vision.
All right, for good measure, that's where Nigeria is on the African map, and just there is the Delta region that I'm sure everybody's heard of.
People getting kidnapped, where the oil comes from, the oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria.
But, critical poverty: this slide is from a presentation I gave not that long ago. Gapminder.org tells the story of the gap between Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care.
Very interesting.
How many people do you think are on that taxi?
And believe it or not, that is a taxi in Nigeria.
And the capital -- well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria -- Lagos, that's a taxi, and you have police on them.
So, tell me, how many policemen do you think are on this taxi? And now? Three.
So, when these kind of people -- and, believe me, it's not just the police that use these taxis in Lagos. We all do. I've been on one of these, and I didn't have a helmet, either.
And it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us on a taxi like this falls off, has an accident and needs a hospital.
Believe it or not, some of us do survive.
Some of us do survive malaria; we do survive AIDS.
And like I tell my family, and my wife reminds me every time, "You're risking your life, you know, every time you go to that country."
And she's right. Every time you go there, you know that if you actually need critical care -- critical care of any sort -- if you have an accident -- of which there are many, there are accidents everywhere -- where do they go?
Where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff?
I'm not saying instead of, I'm saying as well as, AIDS, TB, malaria, typhoid -- the list goes on.
I'm saying, where do they go when they're like me?
When I go back home -- and I do all kinds of things, I teach, I train -- but I catch one of these things, or I'm chronically ill with one of those, where do they go?
What's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled?
I think it's quite significant. This is where they go.
These are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden -- this is a major hospital. In fact, it's from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria.
Now that is less than a year old, in an operating room.
That's sterilizing equipment in Nigeria.
You remember all that oil?
Yes, I'm sorry if it upsets some of you, but I think you need to see this. That's the floor, OK?
You can say some of this is education.
You can say it's hygiene. I'm not pleading poverty.
I'm saying we need more than just, you know, vaccination, malaria, AIDS, because I want to be treated in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there.
In fact, when I start running around saying, "Hey, boys and girls, you're cardiologists in the U.S., can you come home with me and do a mission?"
I want them to think, "Well there's some hope."
Now, have a look at that. That's the anesthesiology machine.
And that's my specialty, right?
Anesthesiology and critical care -- look at that bag.
It's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the U.K.
And believe me, these are current pictures.
Now, if something like this, which has happened in the U.K., that's where they go. This is the intensive care unit in which I work.
All right, this is a slide from a talk I gave about intensive care units in Nigeria, and jokingly we refer to it as "Expensive Scare."
Because it's scary and it's expensive, but we need to have it, OK?
So, these are the problems.
There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are, are there?
I think we all know. And several speakers before and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems.
These are a few of them. So, what did I do?
There we go -- we're going on a mission.
We're going to do some open-heart surgery. I was the only Brit, on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons, cardiac nurse, intensive care nurse.
We all went out and did a mission and we've done three of them so far.
Just so you know, I do believe in missions, I do believe in aid and I do believe in charity. They have their place, but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier?
Because it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission.
Health is wealth, in the words of Hans Rosling.
You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first.
So, here we are, mission. Big trouble.
Open-heart surgery in Nigeria -- big trouble.
That's Mike, Mike comes out from Mississippi.
Does he look like he's happy?
It took us two days just to organize the place, but hey, you know, we worked on it. Does he look happy?
Yes, that's the medical advice the committee chairman says, "Yes, I told you, you weren't going to be able to, you can't do this, I just know it."
Look, that's the technician we had. So yes, you go on, all right?
I got him to come with me -- anesthesia tech -- come with me from the U.K.
Yes, let's just go work this thing out.
See, that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally.
We get a lot of donated equipment.
Equipment that's obsolete, equipment that doesn't quite work, or it works and you can't fix it. And there's nothing wrong with that, so long as we use it and we move on.
But we had problems with it. We had severe problems there.
He had to get on the phone. This guy was always on the phone.
So what we going to do now?
It looks like all these Americans are here and yes, one Brit, and he's not going to do anything -- he thinks he's British actually, and he's actually Nigerian, I just thought about that.
We eventually got it working, is the truth, but it was one of these. Even older than the one you saw.
The reason I have this picture here, this X-ray, it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X-rays.
Do you figure where that is? It was on a window.
I mean, what's an X-ray viewing box? Please.
Well, nowadays everything's on PAX anyway.
You look at your X-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them, you email them. But we were still using X-rays, but we didn't even have a viewing box!
And we were doing open-heart surgery.
OK, I know it's not AIDS, I know it's not malaria, but we still need this stuff. Oh yeah, echo -- this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready.
People still believe in Voodoo. Heart disease, VSD, hole in the heart, tetralogies.
You still get people who believe in it and they came.
At 67 percent oxygen saturation, the normal is about 97.
Her condition, open-heart surgery that as she required, would have been treated when she was a child.
We had to do these for adults. So, we did succeed and we still do.
We've done three. We're planning another one in July in the north of the country. So, we certainly still do open-heart, but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in -- we ship everything, instruments. We had explosions because the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it.
The oxygen tanks didn't quite work right.
But how many did we do the first one? 12.
We did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully.
Here is our very first patient, out of intensive care, and just watch that chair, all right?
This is what I mean about appropriate technology.
That's what he was doing, propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work.
Have you seen one of those before?
No? Yes? Doesn't matter, it worked.
I'm sure you've all seen or heard this before: "We, the willing, have been doing so much with so little for so long -- -- we are now qualified to do anything with nothing."
Thank you. Sustainable Solutions -- this was my first company.
This one's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing.
So, we put my hand in my pocket and say, "Guys, let's just buy stuff.
Let's go set up a company that teaches people, educates them, gives them the tools they need to keep going."
And that's a perfect example of one.
Usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital, you buy a different one for children, you buy a different one for transport. This one will do everything, and it will do it at half the price and doesn't need compressed air.
If you're in America and you don't know about this one, we do, because we make it our duty to find out what's appropriate technology for Africa -- what's appropriately priced, does the job, and we move on. Anesthesia machine: multi-parameter monitor, operating lights, suction.
This little unit here -- remember your little 12-volt plug in the car, that charges your, whatever, Game Boy, telephone?
That's exactly how the outlets are designed.
Yes, it will take a solar panel. Yes a solar panel will charge it.
But if you've got mains as well, it will charge the batteries in there.
And guess what? We have a little pedal charger too, just in case.
And guess what, if it all fails, if you can find a car that's still got a live battery and you stick it in, it will still work. Then you can customize it.
Is it dental surgery you want? General surgery you want?
Decide which instruments, stock it up with consumables.
And currently we're working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site.
The technology for oxygen delivery is not new.
Oxygen concentrators are very old technology. What is new, and what we will have in a few months, I hope, is that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce oxygen on site. Zeolite -- it's not new -- zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is 78 percent of air.
If you take nitrogen out, what's left? Oxygen, pretty much.
So that's not new. What we're doing is applying this technology to it.
These are the basic features of my device, or our device.
This is what makes it so special.
Apart from the awards it's won, it's portable and it's certified. It's registered, the MHRA -- and the CE mark, for those who don't know, for Europe, is the equivalent of the FDA in the U.S.
If you compare it with what's on the market, price-wise, size-wise, ease of use, complexity ...
This picture was taken last year.
These are members of my graduating class, 1986.
It was in this gentleman's house in the Potomac, for those of you who are familiar with Maryland.
There are too many of us outside and everybody, just to borrow a bit from Hans -- Hans Rosling, he's my guy -- if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention, it's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions that are appropriate for Africa -- looking at the culture, looking at the people, looking at how much money they've got.
African people, because they will do it with a passion, I hope.
And lots and lots of that little bit down there, sacrifice.
You have to do it. Africans have to do it, in conjunction with everyone else.
Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/annie_lennox_why_i_am_an_hiv_aids_activist.html</url>
I'm going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV/AIDS campaigner.
And this is the name of my campaign: SING Campaign.
In November of 2003, I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela's 46664 Foundation -- that is his HIV/AIDS foundation.
And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island.
And that's me with Youssou N'Dour, onstage, having the time of my life.
The next day, all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island, where he was going to give a conference to the world's press, standing in front of his former prison cell.
You can see the bars of the window there.
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us.
In that moment in time, Mandela told the world's press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country; that post-apartheid Rainbow Nation, a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims, the most vulnerable of all, were women and children.
This was a huge impact on my mind, because I am a woman and I am a mother, and I hadn't realized that the HIV/AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way.
And so I committed -- when I left South Africa, when I left Capetown, I told myself, "This is going to be something that I have to talk about.
I have to serve."
And so, subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences, interviews, talking and using my platform as a musician, with my commitment to Mandela -- out of respect for the tremendous, unbelievable work that he had done.
Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela, everyone reveres Nelson Mandela.
But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa, his country, the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus?
I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there, they would be shocked.
I was very, very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat, the founder of Treatment Action Campaign, an incredible campaigner and activist.
I met him at a 46664 event.
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now.
This is a tool -- this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV, people who are living with HIV.
And in a way because of the stigma, by wearing this t-shirt I say, "Yes, we can talk about this issue.
It doesn't have to be in the closet."
I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I'm very proud to be a member of that incredible organization.
It's a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women, most of whom are HIV-positive.
They work in the field.
They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus.
They have education programs.
They bring out the issues of stigma.
It's quite extraordinary what they do.
And yes, my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds.
A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do, and are still continuing to do in South Africa.
So this is my SING Campaign.
SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me.
I've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years -- I went to about 12 different countries.
Here I am in Oslo in Norway, getting a nice, fat check; singing in Hong Kong, trying to get people to raise money.
In Johannesburg, I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white, middle-class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart, the whole nature, of this terrible tragedy that is taking place, that people are tending to avoid, because they are fatigued, and they really don't quite know what the solutions are.
Aaron Motsoaledi, the current health minister, attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him, and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change, which is absolutely necessary.
This is in the Scottish Parliament.
I've subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV.
And I was showing them my experiences and trying to, again, raise awareness.
And once again, in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore.
And it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus.
I'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe -- he's the director of UNAIDS.
And I'm very honored by the fact that Michel invited me, only a few months ago, to become a UNAIDS ambassador.
And in this way, I've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach.
The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015.
It's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will.
This can happen.
And here I am with a pregnant woman, who is HIV positive and we're smiling, both of us are smiling, because we're very confident, because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to.
And her baby will receive PMTCT, which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus.
Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life.
It's one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic.
Now, I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile.
This is Avelile -- she goes with me wherever I go.
I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV/AIDS orphans.
Avelile's mother had HIV virus -- she died from AIDS-related illness.
Avelile had the virus, she was born with the virus.
And here she is at seven years old, weighing no more than a one year-old baby.
At this point in her life, she's suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia.
We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her -- an adorable child.
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal.
They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her.
And we didn't know when we left the hospital -- because we filmed her story -- we didn't know if she was going to survive.
So, it was obviously -- it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience, this one child, you know, that story.
Five months later, we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again.
And I'm getting -- the hairs on my -- I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms.
They're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you.
This is the transformation that took place.
Isn't it extraordinary?
That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile.
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation.
So, I would like to say to you, each one in the audience, if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care, and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals, specifically five and six, should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world -- especially in sub-Saharan Africa -- could you please stand up.
I think that's fair to say, it's almost everyone in the hall.
Thank you very much.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/rebecca_mackinnon_let_s_take_back_the_internet.html</url>
So I begin with an advertisement inspired by George Orwell that Apple ran in 1984.
Big Brother: We are one people with one will, one resolve, one cause.
Our enemies shall talk themselves to death, and we will fight them with their own confusion.
We shall prevail.
On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh.
And you'll see why 1984 won't be like "1984."
Rebecca MacKinnon: So the underlying message of this video remains very powerful even today.
Technology created by innovative companies will set us all free.
Fast-forward more than two decades: Apple launches the iPhone in China and censors the Dalai Lama out along with several other politically sensitive applications at the request of the Chinese government for its Chinese app store.
The American political cartoonist Mark Fiore also had his satire application censored in the United States because some of Apple's staff were concerned it would be offensive to some groups.
His app wasn't reinstated until he won the Pulitzer Prize.
The German magazine Stern, a news magazine, had its app censored because the Apple nannies deemed it to be a little bit too racy for their users, and despite the fact that this magazine is perfectly legal for sale on newsstands throughout Germany.
And more controversially, recently, Apple censored a Palestinian protest app after the Israeli government voiced concerns that it might be used to organize violent attacks.
So here's the thing.
We have a situation where private companies are applying censorship standards that are often quite arbitrary and generally more narrow than the free speech constitutional standards that we have in democracies.
Or they're responding to censorship requests by authoritarian regimes that do not reflect consent of the governed.
Or they're responding to requests and concerns by governments that have no jurisdiction over many, or most, of the users and viewers who are interacting with the content in question.
So here's the situation.
In a pre-Internet world, sovereignty over our physical freedoms, or lack thereof, was controlled almost entirely by nation-states.
But now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace.
And their decisions about software coding, engineering, design, terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives.
And their sovereignties, cross-cutting, globally interlinked, can in some ways challenge the sovereignties of nation-states in very exciting ways, but sometimes also act to project and extend it at a time when control over what people can and cannot do with information has more effect than ever on the exercise of power in our physical world.
After all, even the leader of the free world needs a little help from the sultan of Facebookistan if he wants to get reelected next year.
And these platforms were certainly very helpful to activists in Tunisia and Egypt this past spring and beyond.
As Wael Ghonim, the Google-Egyptian-executive by day, secret-Facebook-activist by night, famously said to CNN after Mubarak stepped down, "If you want to liberate a society, just give them the Internet."
But overthrowing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated.
On the left there's a photo taken by an Egyptian activist who was part of the storming of the Egyptian state security offices in March.
And many of the agents shredded as many of the documents as they could and left them behind in piles.
But some of the files were left behind intact, and activists, some of them, found their own surveillance dossiers full of transcripts of their email exchanges, their cellphone text message exchanges, even Skype conversations.
And one activist actually found a contract from a Western company for the sale of surveillance technology to the Egyptian security forces.
And Egyptian activists are assuming that these technologies for surveillance are still being used by the transitional authorities running the networks there.
And in Tunisia, censorship actually began to return in May -- not nearly as extensively as under President Ben Ali.
But you'll see here a blocked page of what happens when you try to reach certain Facebook pages and some other websites that the transitional authorities have determined might incite violence.
In protest over this, blogger Slim Amamou, who had been jailed under Ben Ali and then became part of the transitional government after the revolution, he resigned in protest from the cabinet.
But there's been a lot of debate in Tunisia about how to handle this kind of problem.
In fact, on Twitter, there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution who said, "Well actually, we do want democracy and free expression, but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off-bounds because it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy.
But the problem is, how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions and how do you make sure that they do not abuse their power?
As Riadh Guerfali, the veteran digital activist from Tunisia, remarked over this incident, "Before, things were simple: you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other.
Today, things are a lot more subtle."
Welcome to democracy, our Tunisian and Egyptian friends.
The reality is that even in democratic societies today, we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks.
In fact, in the United States, whatever you may think of Julian Assange, even people who are not necessarily big fans of his are very concerned about the way in which the United States government and some companies have handled Wikileaks.
Amazon webhosting dropped Wikileaks as a customer after receiving a complaint from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman, despite the fact that Wikileaks had not been charged, let alone convicted, of any crime.
So we assume that the Internet is a border-busting technology.
This is a map of social networks worldwide, and certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world -- which is either a good or a bad thing, depending on how you like the way Facebook manages its service.
But borders do persist in some parts of cyberspace.
In Brazil and Japan, it's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons.
But if you look at China, Vietnam and a number of the former Soviet states, what's happening there is more troubling.
You have a situation where the relationship between government and local social networking companies is creating a situation where, effectively, the empowering potential of these platforms is being constrained because of these relationships between companies and government.
Now in China, you have the "great firewall," as it's well-known, that blocks Facebook and Twitter and now Google+ and many of the other overseas websites.
And that's done in part with the help from Western technology.
But that's only half of the story.
The other part of the story are requirements that the Chinese government places on all companies operating on the Chinese Internet, known as a system of self-discipline.
In plain English, that means censorship and surveillance of their users.
And this is a ceremony I actually attended in 2009 where the Internet Society of China presented awards to the top 20 Chinese companies that are best at exercising self-discipline -- i.e. policing their content.
And Robin Li, CEO of Baidu, China's dominant search engine, was one of the recipients.
In Russia, they do not generally block the Internet and directly censor websites.
But this is a website called Rospil that's an anti-corruption site.
And earlier this year, there was a troubling incident where people who had made donations to Rospil through a payments processing system called Yandex Money suddenly received threatening phone calls from members of a nationalist party who had obtained details about donors to Rospil through members of the security services who had somehow obtained this information from people at Yandex Money.
This has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the Internet to hold government accountable.
So we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is mediated through the Internet, which is comprised primarily of privately owned and operated services.
So the important question, I think, is not this debate over whether the Internet is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys.
Of course, it's going to empower whoever is most skilled at using the technology and best understands the Internet in comparison with whoever their adversary is.
The most urgent question we need to be asking today is how do we make sure that the Internet evolves in a citizen-centric manner.
Because I think all of you will agree that the only legitimate purpose of government is to serve citizens, and I would argue that the only legitimate purpose of technology is to improve our lives, not to manipulate or enslave us.
So the question is, we know how to hold government accountable.
We don't necessarily always do it very well, but we have a sense of what the models are, politically and institutionally, to do that.
How do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace accountable to the public interest when most CEO's argue that their main obligation is to maximize shareholder profit?
And government regulation often isn't helping all that much.
You have situations, for instance, in France where president Sarkozy tells the CEO's of Internet companies, "We're the only legitimate representatives of the public interest."
But then he goes and champions laws like the infamous "three-strikes" law that would disconnect citizens from the Internet for file sharing, which has been condemned by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression as being a disproportionate violation of citizens' right to communications, and has raised questions amongst civil society groups about whether some political representatives are more interested in preserving the interests of the entertainment industry than they are in defending the rights of their citizens.
And here in the United Kingdom there's also concern over a law called the Digital Economy Act that's placing more onus on private intermediaries to police citizen behavior.
So what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a citizen-centric Internet in the future, we need a broader and more sustained Internet freedom movement.
After all, companies didn't stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course, or employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course, just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do.
It was the result of decades of sustained activism, shareholder advocacy and consumer advocacy.
Similarly, governments don't enact intelligent environmental and labor laws just because politicians wake up one day.
It's the result of very sustained and prolonged political activism that you get the right regulations, and that you get the right corporate behavior.
We need to make the same approach with the Internet.
We also are going to need political innovation.
Eight hundred years ago, approximately, the barons of England decided that the Divine Right of Kings was no longer working for them so well, and they forced King John to sign the Magna Carta, which recognized that even the king who claimed to have divine rule still had to abide by a basic set of rules.
This set off a cycle of what we can call political innovation, which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed -- which was implemented for the first time by that radical revolutionary government in America across the pond.
So now we need to figure out how to build consent of the networked.
And what does that look like?
At the moment, we still don't know.
But it's going to require innovation that's not only going to need to focus on politics, on geopolitics, but it's also going to need to deal with questions consumer choice and even software design and engineering.
Each and every one of us has a vital part to play in building the kind of world in which government and technology serve the world's people and not the other way around.
Thank you very much.

<title>Rebecca MacKinnon: Let's take back the Internet!</title>
<description>In this powerful talk from TEDGlobal, Rebecca MacKinnon describes the expanding struggle for freedom and control in cyberspace, and asks: How do we design the next phase of the Internet with accountability and freedom at its core, rather than control? She believes the internet is headed for a "Magna Carta" moment when citizens around the world demand that their governments protect free speech and their right to connection.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/misha_glenny_investigates_global_crime_networks.html</url>
These are grim economic times, fellow TEDsters, grim economic times indeed.
And so, I would like to cheer you up with one of the great, albeit largely unknown, commercial success stories of the past 20 years.
Comparable, in its own very peculiar way, to the achievements of Microsoft or Google.
And it's an industry which has bucked the current recession with equanimity.
I refer to organized crime.
Now organized crime has been around for a very long time, I hear you say, and these would be wise words, indeed.
But in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP.
I like to call it the Global Shadow Economy, or McMafia, for short.
So what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime?
Well, of course, there is globalization, technology, communications, all that stuff, which we'll talk about a little bit later.
But first, I would like to take you back to this event: the collapse of communism.
All across Eastern Europe, a most momentous episode in our post-war history.
Now it's time for full disclosure.
This event meant a great deal to me personally.
I had started smuggling books across the Iron Curtain to Democratic opposition groups in Eastern Europe, like Solidarity in Poland, when I was in my teens.
I then started writing about Eastern Europe, and eventually I became the BBC's chief correspondent for the region, which is what I was doing in 1989.
And so when 425 million people finally won the right to choose their own governments, I was ecstatic, but I was also a touch worried about some of the nastier things lurking behind the wall.
It wasn't long, for example, before ethnic nationalism reared its bloody head in Yugoslavia.
And amongst the chaos, amidst the euphoria, it took me a little while to understand that some of the people who had wielded power before 1989, in Eastern Europe, continued to do so after the revolutions there.
Obviously there were characters like this.
But there were also some more unexpected people who played a critical role in what was going on in Eastern Europe.
Like this character. Remember these guys?
They used to win the gold medals in weightlifting and wrestling, every four years in the Olympics, and they were the great celebrities of communism, with a fabulous lifestyle to go with it.
They used to get great apartments in the center of town, casual sex on tap, and they could travel to the West very freely, which was a great luxury at the time.
It may come as a surprise, but they played a critical role in the emergence of the market economy in Eastern Europe.
Or as I like to call them, they are the midwives of capitalism.
Here are some of those same weightlifters after their 1989 makeover.
Now in Bulgaria -- this photograph was taken in Bulgaria -- when communism collapsed all over Eastern Europe, it wasn't just communism; it was the state that collapsed as well.
That means your police force wasn't working.
The court system wasn't functioning properly.
So what was a business man in the brave new world of East European capitalism going to do to make sure that his contracts would be honored?
Well, he would turn to people who were called, rather prosaically by sociologists, privatized law enforcement agencies.
We prefer to know them as the mafia.
And in Bulgaria, the mafia was soon joined with 14,000 people who were sacked from their jobs in the security services between 1989 and 1991.
Now, when your state is collapsing, your economy is heading south at a rate of knots, the last people you want coming on to the labor market are 14,000 men and women whose chief skills are surveillance, are smuggling, building underground networks and killing people.
But that's what happened all over Eastern Europe.
Now, when I was working in the 1990s, I spent most of the time covering the appalling conflict in Yugoslavia.
And I couldn't help notice that the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities, the paramilitary organizations, were actually the same people running the organized criminal syndicates.
And I came to think that behind the violence lay a sinister criminal enterprise.
And so I resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal underworld by talking to policemen, by talking to victims, by talking to consumers of illicit goods and services.
But above all else, by talking to the gangsters themselves.
And the Balkans was a fabulous place to start.
Why? Well of course there was the issue of law and order collapsing, but also, as they say in the retail trade, it's location, location, location.
And what I noticed at the beginning of my research that the Balkans had turned into a vast transit zone for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world.
Heroin, cocaine, women being trafficked into prostitution and precious minerals.
And where were they heading?
The European Union, which by now was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization, transforming it into the most affluent consumer market in history, eventually comprising some 500 million people.
And a significant minority of those 500 million people like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash sleeping with prostitutes, sticking 50 Euro notes up their nose and employing illegal migrant laborers.
Now, organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way as any other business.
It has zones of production, like Afghanistan and Columbia.
It has zones of distribution, like Mexico and the Balkans.
And then, of course, it has zones of consumption, like the European Union, Japan and of course, the United States.
The zones of production and distribution tend to lie in the developing world, and they are often threatened by appalling violence and bloodshed.
Take Mexico, for example.
Six thousand people killed there in the last 18 months as a direct consequence of the cocaine trade.
But what about the Democratic Republic of Congo?
Since 1998, five million people have died there.
It's not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers, but it's the biggest conflict on this planet since the Second World War.
And why is it? Because mafias from all around the world cooperate with local paramilitaries in order to seize the supplies of the rich mineral resources of the region.
In the year 2000, 80 percent of the world's coltan was sourced to the killing fields of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
Now, coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone, in almost every laptop and games console.
The Congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia in exchange for weapons, and the mafia would then sell it on to Western markets.
And it is this Western desire to consume that is the primary driver of international organized crime.
Now, let me show you some of my friends in action, caught conveniently on film by the Italian police, and smuggling duty-not-paid cigarettes.
Now, cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap.
The European Union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world.
So if you can smuggle them into the E.U., there are very handsome profits to be made, and I want to show you this to demonstrate the type of resources available to these groups.
This boat is worth one million Euros when it's new.
And it's the fastest thing on European waters.
From 1994, for seven years, 20 of these boats made the trip across the Adriatic, from Montenegro to Italy, every single night.
And as a consequence of this trade, Britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue.
And instead that money went to underwrite the wars in Yugoslavia and line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals.
Now Italian police, when this trade started, had just two boats which could go at the same speed.
And this is very important, because the only way you can catch these guys is if they run out of gas.
Sometimes the gangsters would bring with them women being trafficked into prostitution, and if the police intervened, they would hurl the women into the sea so that the police had to go and save them from drowning, rather than chasing the bad guys.
So I have shown you this to demonstrate how many boats, how many vessels it takes to catch one of these guys.
And the answer is six vessels.
And remember, 20 of these speed boats were coming across the Adriatic every single night.
So what were these guys doing with all the money they were making?
Well, this is where we come to globalization, because that was not just the deregulation of global trade.
It was the liberalization of international financial markets.
And boy, did that make it easy for the money launderers.
The last two decades have been the champagne era for dirty lucre.
In the 1990s, we saw financial centers around the world competing for their business, and there was simply no effective mechanism to prevent money laundering.
And a lot of licit banks were also happy to accept deposits from very dubious sources without questions being asked.
But at the heart of this, is the offshore banking network.
Now these things are an essential part of the money laundering parade, and if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion and transnational organized crime, money laundering, you have to get rid of them.
On a positive note, we at last have someone in the White House who has consistently spoken out against these corrosive entities.
And if anyone is concerned about what I believe is the necessity for new legislation, regulation, effective regulation, I say, let's take a look at Bernie Madoff, who is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail.
Bernie Madoff stole 65 billion dollars.
That puts him up there on the Olympus of gangsters with the Colombian cartels and the major Russian crime syndicates, but he did this for decades in the very heart of Wall Street, and no regulator picked up on it.
So how many other Madoffs are there on Wall Street or in the city of London, fleecing ordinary folk and money laundering?
Well I can tell you, it's quite a few of them.
Let me go on to the 101 of international organized crime now.
And that is narcotics. Our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning.
This one, however, is in central British Columbia where I photographed it.
It's one of the tens of thousands of mom-and-pop grow-ops in B.C.
which ensure that over five percent of the province's GDP is accounted for by this trade.
Now, I was taken by inspector Brian Cantera, of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, to a cavernous warehouse east of Vancouver to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated by the RCMP from the smugglers who are sending it, of course, down south to the United States where there is an insatiable market for B.C. Bud, as it's called, in part because it's marketed as organic, which of course goes down very well in California.
Now, even by the police's admission, this makes not a dent in the profits, really, of the major exporters.
Since the beginning of globalization, the global narcotics market has expanded enormously.
There has, however, been no concomitant increase in the resources available to police forces.
This, however, may all be about to change, because something very strange is going on.
The United Nations recognized earlier this -- it was last month actually -- that Canada has become a key area of distribution and production of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs.
Interestingly, the market share of heroin and cocaine is going down, because the pills are getting ever better at reproducing their highs.
Now that is a game changer, because it shifts production away from the developing world and into the Western world.
When that happens, it is a trend which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the West.
The drugs policy which we've had in place for 40 years is long overdue for a very serious rethink, in my opinion.
Now, the recession.
Well, organized crime has already adapted very well to the recession.
Not surprising, the most opportunistic industry in the whole world.
And it has no rules to its regulatory system.
Except, of course, it has two business risks: arrest by law enforcement, which is, frankly, the least of their worries, and competition from other groups, i.e. a bullet in the back of the head.
What they've done is they've shifted their operations.
People don't smoke as much dope, or visit prostitutes quite so frequently during a recession.
And so instead, they have invaded financial and corporate crime in a big way, but above all, two sectors, and that is counterfeit goods and cybercrime.
And it's been terribly successful.
I would like to introduce you to Mr. Pringle.
Or perhaps I should say, more accurately, Señor Pringle.
I was introduced to this bit of kit by a Brazilian cybercriminal.
We sat in a car on the Avenue Paulista in São Paulo, together.
Hooked it up to my laptop, and within about five minutes he had penetrated the computer security system of a major Brazilian bank.
It's really not that difficult.
And it's actually much easier because the fascinating thing about cybercrime is that it's not so much the technology.
The key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering.
Or to use the technical term for it, there's one born every minute.
You would not believe how easy it is to persuade people to do things with their computers which are objectively not in their interest.
And it was very soon when the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this, of course, the quickest way to a person's wallet is through the promise of sex and love.
I expect some of you remember the ILOVEYOU virus, one of the very great worldwide viruses that came.
I was very fortunate when the ILOVEYOU virus came out, because the first person I received it from was an ex-girlfriend of mine.
Now, she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time, but love was not amongst them.
And so as soon as I saw this drop into my inbox, I dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin and spared myself a very nasty infection.
So, cybercrime, do watch out for it.
One thing that we do know that the Internet is doing is the Internet is assisting these guys.
These are mosquitos who carry the malarial parasite which infests our blood when the mosy has had a free meal at our expense.
Now, Artesunate is a very effective drug at destroying the parasite in the early days of infection.
But over the past year or so, researchers in Cambodia have discovered that what's happening is the malarial parasite is developing a resistance.
And they fear that the reason why it's developing a resistance is because Cambodians can't afford the drugs on the commercial market, and so they buy it from the Internet.
And these pills contain only low doses of the active ingredient.
Which is why the parasite is beginning to develop a resistance.
The reason I say this is because we have to know that organized crime impacts all sorts of areas of our lives.
You don't have to sleep with prostitutes or take drugs in order to have a relationship with organized crime.
They affect our bank accounts.
They affect our communications, our pension funds.
They even affect the food that we eat and our governments.
This is no longer an issue of Sicilians from Palermo and New York.
There is no romance involved with gangsters in the 21st Century.
This is a mighty industry, and it creates instability and violence wherever it goes.
It is a major economic force and we need to take it very, very seriously.
It's been a privilege talking to you.
Thank you very much.

<title>Misha Glenny: How global crime networks work</title>
<description>Journalist Misha Glenny spent several years in a courageous investigation of organized crime networks worldwide, which have grown to an estimated 15% of the global economy. From the Russian mafia, to giant drug cartels, his sources include not just intelligence and law enforcement officials but criminal insiders.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/elaine_morgan_says_we_evolved_from_aquatic_apes.html</url>
Well, this is 2009.
And it's the Bicentenary of Charles Darwin.
And all over the world, eminent evolutionists are anxious to celebrate this.
on almost every aspect of Darwin and his life, and how he changed our thinking.
I say almost every aspect, because there is one aspect of this story which they have thrown no light on.
And they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it and to talk about something else.
So I'm going to talk about it.
It's the question of, why are we so different from the chimpanzees?
We get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related -- hardly any genes of difference, very, very closely related.
And yet, when you look at the phenotypes, there's a chimp, there's a man; they're astoundingly different, no resemblance at all.
I'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff about culture or psychology, or behavior.
I'm talking about ground-base, nitty-gritty, measurable physical differences.
They, that one, is hairy and walking on four legs.
That one is a naked biped. Why?
I mean -- if I'm a good Darwinist, I've got to believe there's a reason for that.
If we changed so much, something must have happened.
What happened?
Now 50 years ago, that was a laughably simple question.
Everybody knew the answer.
They knew what happened.
The ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees; our ancestors went out onto the plain.
That explained everything.
We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass, or to chase after animals, or to free our hands for weapons.
And we got so overheated in the chase that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away.
Everybody knew that, for generations.
But then, in the '90s, something began to unravel.
The paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely at the accompanying microfauna that lived in the same time and place as the hominids.
And they weren't savanna species.
And they looked at the herbivores. And they weren't savanna herbivores.
And then they were so clever, they found a way to analyze fossilized pollen.
Shock, horror.
The fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation.
Some of it even came from lianas, those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle.
So we're left with a situation where we know that our earliest ancestors were moving around on four legs in the trees, before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence.
This is not something I've made up.
It's not a minority theory.
Everybody agrees with it.
Professor Tobias came over from South Africa and spoke to University College London.
He said, "Everything I've been telling you for the last 20 years, forget about it. It was wrong.
We've got to go back to square one and start again."
It made him very unpopular. They didn't want to go back to square one.
I mean, it's a terrible thing to happen.
You've got this beautiful paradigm.
You've believed it through generations.
Nobody has questioned it.
You've been constructing fanciful things on top of it, relying on it to be as solid as a rock.
And now it's whipped away from under you.
What do you do? What does a scientist do in that case?
Well, we know the answer because Thomas S. Kuhn wrote a seminal treatise about this back in 1962.
He said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is, guess what -- they carry on as if nothing had happened.
If they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question.
So they say, "Yes it's wrong, but supposing it was right ..."
And the only other option open to them is to stop asking the questions.
So that is what they have done now.
That's why you don't hear them talking about it. It's yesterday's question.
Some of them have even elevated it into a principle.
It's what we ought to be doing.
Aaron Filler from Harvard said, "Isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures?
I mean, why don't we talk about, well, there's chromosomes, and there's genes.
And we just record what we see."
Charles Darwin must be spinning in his grave!
He knew all about that kind of science.
And he called it hypothesis-free science.
And he despised it from the bottom of his heart.
And if you're going to say, "I'm going to stop talking about selective pressures," you can take "The Origin of Species" and throw it out of the window, for it's about nothing else but selective pressures.
And the irony of it is, that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse where we didn't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up.
There was one waiting in the wings.
It had been waiting there since 1960 when Alister Hardy, a marine biologist, said, "I think what happened, perhaps our ancestors had a more aquatic existence for some of the time."
He kept it to himself for 30 years.
But then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose.
All his colleagues said, "This is outrageous.
You've exposed us to public ridicule!
You must never do that again."
And at that time, it became set in stone: the aquatic theory should be dumped with the UFOs and the yetis, as part of the lunatic fringe of science.
Well I don't think that.
I think that Hardy had a lot going for him.
I'd like to talk about just a handful of what have been called the hallmarks of mankind, the things that made us different from everybody else, and all our relatives.
Let's look at our naked skin.
It's obvious that most of the things we think about that have lost their body hair, mammals without body hair, are aquatic ones, like the dugong, the walrus, the dolphin, the hippopotamus, the manatee.
And a couple of wallowers-in-mud like the babirusa.
And you're tempted to think, well perhaps, could that be why we are naked?
I suggested it and people said, "No no no.
I mean, look at the elephant.
You've forgotten all about the elephant haven't you?"
So back in 1982 I said, "Well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor."
Peals of merry laughter!
"That crazy woman. She's off again. She'll say anything won't she?"
But by now, everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.
This has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors.
The last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros.
Last year in Florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros and said, "Seems to have spent most of its time in the water."
So this is a close connection between nakedness and water.
As an absolute connection, it only works one way.
You can't say all aquatic animals are naked, because look at the sea otter.
But you can say that every animal that has become naked has been conditioned by water, in its own lifetime, or the lifetime of its ancestors. I think this is significant.
The only exception is the naked Somalian mole-rat, which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground.
And take bipedality.
Here you can't find anybody to compare it with, because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs.
But you can say this: all the apes and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs, if they want to, for a short time.
There is only one circumstance in which they always, all of them, walk on two legs, and that is when they are wading through water.
Do you think that's significant?
David Attenborough thinks it's significant, as the possible beginning of our bipedalism.
Look at the fat layer.
We have got, under our skin, a layer of fat, all over: nothing in the least like that in any other primate.
Why should it be there?
Well they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals, the fat that in most land mammals is deposited inside the body wall, around the kidneys and the intestines and so on, has started to migrate to the outside, and spread out in a layer inside the skin.
In the whale it's complete: no fat inside at all, all in blubber outside.
We cannot avoid the suspicion that in our case it's started to happen.
We have got skin lined with this layer.
It's the only possible explanation of why humans, if they're very unlucky, can become grossly obese, in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate, physically impossible.
Something very odd, matter-of-factly, never explained.
The question of why we can speak.
We can speak.
And the gorilla can't speak. Why?
Nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that -- purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath.
You can't even train a gorilla to say "Ah" on request.
The only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath are the diving animals and the diving birds.
It was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak.
And then again, there is the fact that we are streamlined.
Trying to imagine a diver diving into water -- hardly makes a splash.
Try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver, and you can see that, compared with gorilla, we are halfway to being shaped like a fish.
I am trying to suggest that, for 40-odd years, this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe, and it is not lunatic fringe.
And the ironic thing about it is that they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own, which they've all agreed on, and they love.
There is nothing there.
They are staving off the aquatic theory to protect a vacuum.
How do they react when I say these things?
One very common reaction I've heard about 20 times is, "But it was investigated.
They conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning, when Hardy put forward his article."
I don't believe it.
For 35 years I've been looking for any evidence of any incident of that kind, and I've concluded that that's one of the urban myths.
It's never been done.
I ask people sometimes, and they say, "I like the aquatic theory!
Everybody likes the aquatic theory.
Of course they don't believe it, but they like it."
Well I say, "Why do you think it's rubbish?"
They say "Well ...
everybody I talk to says it's rubbish.
And they can't all be wrong, can they?"
The answer to that, loud and clear, is, "Yes! They can all be wrong."
History is strewn with the cases when they've all got it wrong.
And if you've got a scientific problem like that, you can't solve it by holding a head count, and saying, "More of us say yes than say no."
Apart from that, some of the heads count more than others.
Some of them have come over.
There was Professor Tobias. He's come over.
Daniel Dennett, he's come over.
Sir David Attenborough, he's come over.
Anybody else out there? Come on in.
The water is lovely.
And now we've got to look to the future.
Ultimately one of three things is going to happen.
Either they will go on for the next 40 years, 50 years, 60 years.
"Yeah well we don't talk about that. Let's talk about something interesting."
That would be very sad.
The second thing that could happen is that some young genius will arrive, and say, "I've found it.
It was not the savanna, it was not the water, it was this!"
No sign of that happening either.
I don't think there is a third option.
So the third thing that might happen is a very beautiful thing.
If you look back at the early years of the last century, there was a stand-off, a lot of bickering and bad feeling between the believers in Mendel, and the believers in Darwin.
It ended with a new synthesis: Darwin's ideas and Mendel's ideas blending together.
And I think the same thing will happen here.
You'll get a new synthesis.
Hardy's ideas and Darwin's ideas will be blended together.
And we can move forward from there, and really get somewhere.
That would be a beautiful thing.
It would be very nice for me if it happened soon.
Because I'm older now than George Burns was when he said, "At my age, I don't even buy green bananas."
So if it's going to come and it's going to happen, what's holding it up?
I can tell you that in three words.
Academia says no.
They decided in 1960, "That belongs with the UFOs and the yetis."
And it's not easy to change their minds.
The professional journals won't touch it with a barge pole.
The textbooks don't mention it.
The syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked, let alone look for a reason to it.
"Horizon," which takes its cue from the academics, won't touch it with a barge pole.
So we never hear the case put for it, except in jocular references to people on the lunatic fringe.
I don't know quite where this diktat comes from.
Somebody up there is issuing the commandment, "Thou shalt not believe in the aquatic theory.
And if you hope to make progress in this profession, and you do believe it, you'd better keep it to yourself, because it will get in your way."
So I get the impression that some parts of the scientific establishment are morphing into a kind of priesthood.
But you know, that makes me feel good, because Richard Dawkins has told us how to treat a priesthood.
He says, "Firstly, you've got to refuse to give it all the excessive awe and reverence it's been trained to receive."
Right. I'll go ahead with that.
And secondly, he says, "You must never be afraid to rock the boat."
I'll go along with that too.
Thank you very much.

You know, when Chris first approached me to speak at TED, I said no, because I felt like I wasn't going to be able to make that personal connection, you know, that I wanted to.
It's such a large conference.
But he explained to me that he was in a bind, and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal and star power that the conference was known for -- so I said fine, Ted -- I mean Chris. I'll come on two conditions.
One -- I want to speak as early in the morning as possible.
And two -- I want to pick the theme for TED 2006.
And luckily he agreed. And the theme, in two years, is going to be "Cute Pictures Of Puppies."
I invented the Placebo Camera.
It doesn't actually take pictures, but it's a hell of a lot cheaper, and you still feel like you were there.
"Dear Sir, Good day, compliments of the day, and my best wishes to you and family. I know this letter will come to you surprisingly, but let it not be a surprise to you, for nature has a way of arriving unannounced, and, as an adage says, originals are very hard to find, but their echoes sound louder. So I decided to contact you myself, for you to assure me of safety and honesty, if I have to entrust any amount of money under your custody.
I am Mister Michael Bangoora, the son of late Mister Tiamu Bangoora -- who was the Minister of Finance in Sierra Leone -- but was killed during a civil war.
Knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment, and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business, on which premise I write you.
Before my father death, he had the sum of 23 million United States dollars, which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war.
This fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country, before the outbreak of war. When the war broke out, the rebel leader demanded that the fund be given to him, my father insisted it was not in his possession, and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund.
Meanwhile, my mother and I is the only person who knows about the fund because my father always confide in me.
I quickly made an arrangement with a Red Cross relief worker, who used his official van to transport the money to Lungi Airport, Freetown, although he did not know the real contents of the box.
The fund was deposited as a family reassure, in a safe, reliable security company in Dakar, Senegal, where I was only given temporary asylum.
I do not wish to invest the money in Senegal due to unfavorable economic climate, and so close to my country.
The only assistance I need from you, which I know you would do for me, are the following: one, be a silent partner and receive the funds in your account in trust; two, provide a bank account under your control to which the funds will be remitted; three, receive the funds into your account in trust; take out your commission; and leave the rest of the money until I arrive, after the transfer is complete.
Sincerely, Mister Michael Bangoora."
This is really embarrassing.
I was told backstage that I have 18 minutes.
I only prepared 15.
So if it's cool, I'd like to just wait for three.
I'm really sorry.
What's your name?
Mark Serfaas. It's pretty cool, huh? Pursuing happiness.
Are you a virgin? Virgin?
I mean -- no, I mean like in the TED sense?
Are you? Oh, yeah. So what are you, like, a thousand, two thousand, somewhere in there? Huh? Oh?
You don't know what I'm talking about?
Ah, Mark -- Serfaas.
1,860 -- am I good?
And that's nothing to be ashamed of.
That's nothing to be ashamed of.
Yeah, I was hanging out with some Google guys last night.
Really cool, we were getting wasted.
And they were telling me that Google software has gotten so advanced that, based on your interaction with Google over your lifetime, they can actually predict what you are going to say next.
And I was like, "Get the fuck out of here. That's crazy."
But they said, "No, but don't show anyone," but they slipped up.
And they said that I could just type in "What was I going to say next?"
and my name, and it would tell me. And I have to tell you, right now, this is an unadulterated piece of software, this is a real Internet browser and this is an actual Google site, and we're going to test it out live today.
What was I going to say next? And "Ze Frank" -- that's me.
Am I feeling lucky?
Am I feeling lucky?
Audience: Yes.
Ze Frank: Oh. Amazing.
In March of 2001 -- I filmed myself dancing to Madonna's "Justify My Love."
On a Thursday, I sent out a link to a website that featured those clips to 17 of my closest friends, as part of my -- an invitation to my -- an invitation to my th -- th -- 26th birthday party.
By Monday, over a million people were coming to this site a day.
Within a week, I received a call from Earthlink that said, due to a 10 cents per megabyte overage charge, I owed them 30,000 dollars.
Needless to say, I was able to leave my job.
And, finally, you know, become freelance.
But some people refer to me more of -- as, like, an Internet guru or -- swami.
I -- I knew I had something.
I'd basically distilled a very difficult-to-explain and complex philosophy, which I won't get into here, because it's a little too deep for all of you, but -- it's about what makes websites popular, and, you know, it's -- it's unfortunate that I don't have more time.
Maybe I can come back next year, or something like that.
I'm obsessed with email. I get a lot of it.
Four years later, I still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people I don't know, and it's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures, you know?
It's like a microscope to the rest of the world.
You can kind of peer into other people's lives, and I also feel like I get a lot of inspiration from the average user.
For example, somebody wrote me.
They said, "Hey Ze, if you ever come to Boulder, you should rock out with us," and I said, "Why wait?"
And they said, "Hey Ze, thanks for rocking out, but I meant the kind of rocking out where we'd be naked."
And that was embarrassing.
But you know, it's kind of a collaboration between me and the fans, so I said, "Sure."
I hear a lot of you whispering.
And I know what you're saying. You're saying, "Holy crap, how is his presentation so smooth?"
And I have to say that it's not all me this year.
I guess Chris has to take some credit here, because in years past, I guess there's been some sort of subpar speakers at TED. I don't know.
And so, this year, Chris sent us a TED Conference simulator.
Which really allowed us as speakers to get there, in the trenches, and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience.
And I gotta say that, you know, it's really, really great to be here.
I'd like to tell all of you a little joke. Not just the good stuff, though.
You can do heckler mode.
Voice: Hey, moron, get off the stage.
ZF: You get off the stage.
Voice: We want Malcolm Gladwell.
In case you run over time.
I'd -- just one last thing I'd like to say, I'd, really -- like to thank all of you for being here.
And frog mode.
"Ah, the first time that I made love to a rock shrimp ..."
It's true. Some people say to me, they say, "Ze, you're doing all this stuff, this Internet stuff, and you're not making any money.
"Why?" And I say, "Mom, Dad -- "I'm trying." You know, I don't know if you're all aware of this, but the video -- the video game market, kids are playing these video games, oh, but, supposedly, there's tons of money.
I mean, like, I think, 100,000 dollars or so a year is being spent on these things. So I decided to try my hand.
I came up with a few games.
This is called "Atheist."
I figured it'd be popular with the young kids.
Look, I'll move around and say some things.
So that didn't go over so well.
I don't really understand why you're laughing.
Should have done this before I tried to pitch it.
"Buddhist," of course, looks very, very similar to "Atheist."
But you come back as a duck.
And this is great because, you know, for a quarter, you can play this for a long time.
And Chris had said in an email that, you know, we should really bring something new to TED, something that we haven't shown anyone.
So, I made this for TED. It's "Christian."
It's the third in the series.
I'm hoping it's going to do well this year.
Do you have a preference? Good choice.
So you can wait for the Second Coming -- which is -- a random number between one and 500 million.
So really, what are we talking about here? Oh, tech joy.
Tech joy, to me, means something, because I get a lot of joy out of tech.
And in fact, making things using technology -- and I'm being serious here, even though I'm using my sarcastic voice -- I won't -- hold on. Making things, you know -- making things actually does give me a lot of joy.
It's the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life, and it's that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project -- where you know you still have something to do, but it's not finished, and you're not starting something -- that really fills my entire life.
And so, what I've done is, I started getting interested in creating online social spaces to share that feeling with people who don't consider themselves artists.
We're in a culture of guru-ship. It's so hard to use some software because, you know, it's unapproachable, people feel like they have to read the manual.
So I try to -- -- I try to create these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves, and, hopefully -- whoa, I'm like -- on the page, but it doesn't exist.
It's, like -- seriously, though -- I try to create meaningful environments for people to express themselves.
Here I created a contest called, "When Office Supplies Attack," which, I think, really resonated with the -- working population.
Over 500 entries in three weeks, toilet paper fashion.
Again, people from all over the country doing -- the watch is particularly incredible.
Online drawing tools -- you've probably seen a lot of them.
I think they're wonderful.
I think it's a chance for people to get to play with crayons and all that kind of stuff. But I'm interested in the process, the process of creating, as the real event that I'm interested in.
And the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing, and they get bummed out at this, sort of, you know, stick figure, awful little thing that they created.
And eventually, it just makes them stop playing with it, or draw, you know, they draw penises and things like that.
So, the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool.
In other words, it's a helping tool.
You can draw your simple stick figure, and then it collaborates with you to create, sort of, like, a post-war German etching.
So you can -- in fact, it's tuned to be better at drawing things that look worse. So, we go ahead, and we start scribbling, and -- so the idea is that you can really, you know, partake in this process, but watch something really crappy look beautiful.
And here are some of my favorites. This is the little trap marionette that was submitted to me. Here we are, very cool.
Darling. Beautiful stuff.
I mean this is incredible. This is an 11-year-old girl -- drew this and submitted it. It's just gorgeous.
I'm -- I'm dead serious here. I'm actually -- this is not a joke.
But, I think, it's a -- it's a really fun and wonderful thing.
So this is called the "Fiction Project." This is an online space, which is -- it's basically a refurbished message board that encourages collaborative fiction writing.
These are haikus.
None of the haikus were written by the same person, and in fact, no line was -- you know, each line is contributed by a different person at a different -- at a different time.
I think that the "now tied up, tied down, mistress cruel approaches me, now tied down, it's up."
It's -- it's an amazing way, and I'll tell you, if you come home, and your spouse, or whoever it is, says, "Let's talk" -- that, like, chills you to the very core.
But it's peripheral activities, like these, that allow people to get together, doing fun things.
They actually get to know each other, and it's sort of like low-threshold peripheral activities that I think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital that we're lacking. And very, very quickly -- I love puppets. Here's a puppet.
It dances to music. Lotte Reiniger, an amazing shadow puppeteer in the '20s, that started doing more elaborate things.
I became interested in puppets, and I just want to show one last thing to you.
Oh, this is how you make puppets.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Ze Frank.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/omar_ahmad_political_change_with_pen_and_paper.html</url>
One of the things that defines a TEDster is you've taken your passion, and you've turned it into stewardship.
You actually put action to the issues you care about.
But what you're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials to help you out.
So, how do you do that?
One of the things I should probably tell you is, I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career, and that sort of warped my framework.
So, when you start to think about politicians, you've got to realize these are strange creatures.
Other than the fact that they can't tell directions, and they have very strange breeding habits, how do you actually work with these things?
What we need to understand is: What drives the political creature?
And there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart: One is reputation and influence.
These are the primary tools by which a politician can do his job.
The second one -- unlike most animals, which is survival of the species -- this is preservation of self.
Now you may think it's money, but that's actually sort of a proxy to what I can do to preserve myself.
Now, the challenge with you moving your issue forward is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time.
So, what doesn't work, in terms of getting your issue to be important?
You can send them an email.
Well, unfortunately, I've got so many Viagra ads coming at me, your email is lost.
It doesn't matter, it's spam.
How about you get on the phone?
Well, chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone, "Yes, they called, and they said they didn't like it."
That doesn't move.
Face to face would work, but it's hard to set it up.
It's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work.
Yes, contributions actually do make a difference and they set a context for having a conversation, but it takes some time to build up.
So what actually works?
And the answer is rather strange.
It's a letter.
We live in a digital world, but we're fairly analog creatures.
Letters actually work.
Even the top dog himself takes time every day to read 10 letters that are picked out by staff.
I can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean.
So, how are you going to write your letter?
First of all, you're going to pick up an analog device: a pen.
I know these are tough, and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it, but this is actually critical.
And it is critical that you actually handwrite your letter.
It is so novel to see this, that somebody actually picked up an analog device and has written to me.
Second of all, I'm going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month.
Here's my promise to you: If you are consistent and do this, within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and say, "What do you think?"
Now, I'm going to give you a four paragraph format to work with.
Now, when you approach these animals, you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them, and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness.
So in paragraph number one, what I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this: You appreciate them.
You may not appreciate the person, you may not appreciate anything else, but maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig.
When animals are going to make a point, they make the point.
They don't spend a lot of time dicking around.
So, here you go.
Paragraph number two: You may actually have to just get very blunt and say what's really on your mind.
When you do this, don't attack people; you attack tactics.
Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere.
Paragraph number three: When animals are attacked or cornered, they will fight to the death, so you have to give them an exit.
Most of the time, if they have an exit strategy, they should take it.
"Obviously, you're intelligent.
If you had the right information, you would have done the right thing."
Lastly, you want to be the nurturing agent.
You're the safe place to come in to.
So, in paragraph number four, you're going to tell people, "If no one is providing you with this information, let me help."
Animals do displays. They do two things: They warn you or they try to attract you and say, "We need to mate."
You're going to do that by the way you sign your letter.
You do a number of things: you're a vice president, you volunteer, you do something else.
Why is is this important?
Because this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature: that you have influence in a large sphere, and that my preservation depends on you.
Here is one very quick hack, especially for the feds in the audience.
Here's how you mail your letter.
First of all, you send the original to the district office.
So, you send the copy to the main office.
If they follow protocol, they'll pick up the phone and say, "Hey, do you have the original?"
Then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler and says, "Oh, this is an important letter."
And you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read.
So, what your letter means: I've got to tell you, we are all in a party, and political officials are the pinatas.
We are harangued, lectured to, sold, marketed, but a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication.
I got this letter when I was first elected, and I still carry it to every council meeting I go to.
This is an opportunity at real dialogue, and if you have stewardship and want to communicate, that dialogue is incredibly powerful.
So when you do that, here's what I can promise: You're going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the forest.
Get writing.

<keywords>business,culture,politics,social change</keywords>
<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/kate_hartman_the_art_of_wearable_communication.html</url>
My name is Kate Hartman.
And I like to make devices that play with the ways that we relate and communicate.
So I'm specifically interested in how we, as humans, relate to ourselves, each other and the world around us.
So just to give you a bit of context, as June said, I'm an artist, a technologist and an educator.
I teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics.
And much of what I do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form.
And so anytime I talk about what I do, I like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter.
And it's pretty simple.
Everybody's got one -- all of you.
I can guarantee, everyone in this room, all of you over there, the people in the cushy seats, the people up top with the laptops -- we all have bodies.
Don't be ashamed.
It's something that we have in common and they act as our primary interfaces for the world.
And so when working as an interaction designer, or as an artist who deals with participation -- creating things that live on, in or around the human form -- it's really a powerful space to work within.
So within my own work, I use a broad range of materials and tools.
So I communicate through everything from radio transceivers to funnels and plastic tubing.
And to tell you a bit about the things that I make, the easiest place to start the story is with a hat.
And so it all started several years ago, late one night when I was sitting on the subway, riding home, and I was thinking.
And I tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little.
And so I was thinking about how it might be great if I could just take all these noises -- like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head -- if I could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that I could share them with somebody else.
And so I went home, and I made a prototype of this hat.
And I called it the Muttering Hat, because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you, but you could detach them and share them with somebody else.
So I make other hats as well.
This one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat.
It's fairly self-explanatory.
It physically carves out conversation space for one.
And when you speak out loud, the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears.
And so when I make these things, it's really not so much about the object itself, but rather the negative space around the object.
So what happens when a person puts this thing on?
What kind of an experience do they have?
And how are they transformed by wearing it?
So many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves.
So this particular device is called the Gut Listener.
And it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards.
And so some of these things are actually more geared toward expression and communication.
And so the Inflatable Heart is an external organ that can be used by the wearer to express themselves.
So they can actually inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions.
So they can express everything from admiration and lust to anxiety and angst.
And some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences.
So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments.
And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange, but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered.
And in the end, some of these things just act as invitations.
So the Ear Bender literally puts something out there so someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say.
So even though I'm really interested in the relationship between people, I also consider the ways in which we relate to the world around us.
And so when I was first living in New York City a few years back, I was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how I would like to better relate to them.
And I thought, "Well, hey!
Maybe if I want to better relate to walls, maybe I need to be more wall-like myself."
So I made a wearable wall that I could wear as a backpack.
And so I would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that I could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me.
And so jumping off of that, thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world, I have this ongoing project called Botanicalls -- which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols.
So when a plant is thirsty, it can actually make a phone call or post a message to a service like Twitter.
And so this really shifts the human/plant dynamic, because a single house plant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time.
And so kind of thinking about scale, my most recent obsession is actually with glaciers -- of course.
And so glaciers are these magnificent beings, and there's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them, but what I'm particularly interested in is in human-glacier relations.
Because there seems to be an issue.
The glaciers are actually leaving us.
They're both shrinking and retreating -- and some of them have disappeared altogether.
And so I actually live in Canada now, so I've been visiting one of my local glaciers.
And this one's particularly interesting, because, of all the glaciers in North America, it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year.
They actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier.
And this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter.
When I meet a glacier for the very first time, what do I do?
There's no kind of social protocol for this.
I really just don't even know how to say hello.
Do I carve a message in the snow?
Or perhaps I can assemble one out of dot and dash ice cubes -- ice cube Morse code.
Or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool, like an icy megaphone that I can use to amplify my voice when I direct it at the ice.
But really the most satisfying experience I've had is the act of listening, which is what we need in any good relationship.
And I was really struck by how much it affected me.
This very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier.
And so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days, I actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit.
And so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice.
And once again, it's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug.
So, yea, this is actually just the beginning.
These are initial musings for this project.
And just as with the wall, how I wanted to be more wall-like, with this project, I'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace.
And so my intent is to actually just take the next 10 years and go on a series of collaborative projects where I work with people from different disciplines -- artists, technologists, scientists -- to kind of work on this project of how we can improve human-glacier relations.
So beyond that, in closing, I'd just like to say that we're in this era of communications and device proliferation, and it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy, but I think what's really important is thinking about how we can simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world.
Thanks.

So if you've been following the news, you've heard that there's a pack of giant asteroids headed for the United States, all scheduled to strike within the next 50 years.
Now I don't mean actual asteroids made of rock and metal.
That actually wouldn't be such a problem, because if we were really all going to die, we would put aside our differences, we'd spend whatever it took, and we'd find a way to deflect them.
I'm talking instead about threats that are headed our way, but they're wrapped in a special energy field that polarizes us, and therefore paralyzes us.
Last March, I went to the TED conference, and I saw Jim Hansen speak, the NASA scientist who first raised the alarm about global warming in the 1980s, and it seems that the predictions he made back then are coming true.
This is where we're headed in terms of global temperature rises, and if we keep on going the way we're going, we get a four- or five-degree-Centigrade temperature rise by the end of this century.
Hansen says we can expect about a five-meter rise in sea levels.
This is what a five-meter rise in sea levels would look like.
Low-lying cities all around the world will disappear within the lifetime of children born today.
Hansen closed his talk by saying, "Imagine a giant asteroid on a collision course with Earth.
That is the equivalent of what we face now.
Yet we dither, taking no action to deflect the asteroid, even though the longer we wait, the more difficult and expensive it becomes."
Of course, the left wants to take action, but the right denies that there's any problem.
All right, so I go back from TED, and then the following week, I'm invited to a dinner party in Washington, D.C., where I know that I'll be meeting a number of conservative intellectuals, including Yuval Levin, and to prepare for the meeting, I read this article by Levin in National Affairs called "Beyond the Welfare State."
Levin writes that all over the world, nations are coming to terms with the fact that the social democratic welfare state is turning out to be untenable and unaffordable, dependent upon dubious economics and the demographic model of a bygone era.
All right, now this might not sound as scary as an asteroid, but look at these graphs that Levin showed.
This graph shows the national debt as a percentage of America's GDP, and as you see, if you go all the way back to the founding, we borrowed a lot of money to fight the Revolutionary War.
Wars are expensive. But then we'd pay it off, pay it off, pay it off, and then, oh, what's this? The Civil War. Even more expensive.
Borrow a lot of money, pay it off, pay it off, pay it off, get down to near zero, and bang! -- World War I.
Once again, the same process repeats.
Now then we get the Great Depression and World War II.
We rise to an astronomical level, around 118 percent of GDP, really unsustainable, really dangerous.
But we pay it off, pay it off, pay it off, and then, what's this?
Why has it been rising since the '70s?
It's partly due to tax cuts that were unfunded, but it's due primarily to the rise of entitlement spending, especially Medicare.
We're approaching the levels of indebtedness we had at World War II, and the baby boomers haven't even retired yet, and when they do, this is what will happen.
This is data from the Congressional Budget Office showing its most realistic forecast of what would happen if current situations and expectations and trends are extended.
All right, now what you might notice is that these two graphs are actually identical, not in terms of the x- and y-axes, or in terms of the data they present, but in terms of their moral and political implications, they say the same thing.
Let me translate for you.
"We are doomed unless we start acting now.
What's wrong with you people on the other side in the other party?
Can't you see reality? If you won't help, then get the hell out of the way."
We can deflect both of these asteroids.
These problems are both technically solvable.
Our problem and our tragedy is that in these hyper-partisan times, the mere fact that one side says, "Look, there's an asteroid," means that the other side's going to say, "Huh? What?
No, I'm not even going to look up. No."
To understand why this is happening to us, and what we can do about it, we need to learn more about moral psychology.
So I'm a social psychologist, and I study morality, and one of the most important principles of morality is that morality binds and blinds.
It binds us into teams that circle around sacred values but thereby makes us go blind to objective reality.
Think of it like this.
Large-scale cooperation is extremely rare on this planet.
There are only a few species that can do it.
That's a beehive. That's a termite mound, a giant termite mound.
And when you find this in other animals, it's always the same story.
They're always all siblings who are children of a single queen, so they're all in the same boat.
They rise or fall, they live or die, as one.
There's only one species on the planet that can do this without kinship, and that, of course, is us.
This is a reconstruction of ancient Babylon, and this is Tenochtitlan.
Now how did we do this? How did we go from being hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago to building these gigantic cities in just a few thousand years?
It's miraculous, and part of the explanation is this ability to circle around sacred values.
As you see, temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations.
This is an image of Muslims circling the Kaaba in Mecca.
It's a sacred rock, and when people circle something together, they unite, they can trust each other, they become one.
It's as though you're moving an electrical wire through a magnetic field that generates current.
When people circle together, they generate a current.
We love to circle around things.
We circle around flags, and then we can trust each other.
We can fight as a team, as a unit.
But even as morality binds people together into a unit, into a team, the circling blinds them.
It causes them to distort reality.
We begin separating everything into good versus evil.
Now that process feels great. It feels really satisfying.
But it is a gross distortion of reality.
You can see the moral electromagnet operating in the U.S. Congress.
This is a graph that shows the degree to which voting in Congress falls strictly along the left-right axis, so that if you know how liberal or conservative someone is, you know exactly how they voted on all the major issues.
And what you can see is that, in the decades after the Civil War, Congress was extraordinarily polarized, as you would expect, about as high as can be.
But then, after World War I, things dropped, and we get this historically low level of polarization.
This was a golden age of bipartisanship, at least in terms of the parties' ability to work together and solve grand national problems.
But in the 1980s and '90s, the electromagnet turns back on.
Polarization rises.
It used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals could all work together in Congress.
They could rearrange themselves, form bipartisan committees, but as the moral electromagnet got cranked up, the force field increased, Democrats and Republicans were pulled apart.
It became much harder for them to socialize, much harder for them to cooperate.
Retiring members nowadays say that it's become like gang warfare.
Did anybody notice that in two of the three debates, Obama wore a blue tie and Romney wore a red tie?
Do you know why they do this?
It's so that the Bloods and the Crips will know which side to vote for.
The polarization is strongest among our political elites.
Nobody doubts that this is happening in Washington.
But for a while, there was some doubt as to whether it was happening among the people.
Well, in the last 12 years it's become much more apparent that it is.
So look at this data. This is from the American National Elections Survey.
And what they do on that survey is they ask what's called a feeling thermometer rating.
So, how warm or cold do you feel about, you know, Native Americans, or the military, the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, all sorts of groups in American life.
The blue line shows how warmly Democrats feel about Democrats, and they like them.
You know, ratings in the 70s on a 100-point scale.
Republicans like Republicans. That's not a surprise.
But when you look at cross-party ratings, you find, well, that it's lower, but actually, when I first saw this data, I was surprised.
That's actually not so bad. If you go back to the Carter and even Reagan administrations, they were rating the other party 43, 45. It's not terrible.
It drifts downwards very slightly, but now look what happens under George W. Bush and Obama.
It plummets. Something is going on here.
The moral electromagnet is turning back on, and nowadays, just very recently, Democrats really dislike Republicans.
Republicans really dislike the Democrats. We're changing.
It's as though the moral electromagnet is affecting us too.
It's like put out in the two oceans and it's pulling the whole country apart, pulling left and right into their own territories like the Bloods and the Crips.
Now, there are many reasons why this is happening to us, and many of them we cannot reverse.
We will never again have a political class that was forged by the experience of fighting together in World War II against a common enemy.
We will never again have just three television networks, all of which are relatively centrist.
And we will never again have a large group of conservative southern Democrats and liberal northern Republicans making it easy, making there be a lot of overlap for bipartisan cooperation.
So for a lot of reasons, those decades after the Second World War were an historically anomalous time.
We will never get back to those low levels of polarization, I believe.
But there's a lot that we can do. There are dozens and dozens of reforms we can do that will make things better, because a lot of our dysfunction can be traced directly to things that Congress did to itself in the 1990s that created a much more polarized and dysfunctional institution.
These changes are detailed in many books.
These are two that I strongly recommend, and they list a whole bunch of reforms.
I'm just going to group them into three broad classes here.
So if you think about this as the problem of a dysfunctional, hyper-polarized institution, well, the first step is, do what you can so that fewer hyper-partisans get elected in the first place, and when you have closed party primaries, and only the most committed Republicans and Democrats are voting, you're nominating and selecting the most extreme hyper-partisans.
So open primaries would make that problem much, much less severe.
But the problem isn't primarily that we're electing bad people to Congress.
From my experience, and from what I've heard from Congressional insiders, most of the people going to Congress are good, hard-working, intelligent people who really want to solve problems, but once they get there, they find that they are forced to play a game that rewards hyper-partisanship and that punishes independent thinking.
You step out of line, you get punished.
So there are a lot of reforms we could do that will counteract this.
For example, this "Citizens United" ruling is a disaster, because it means there's like a money gun aimed at your head, and if you step out of line, if you try to reach across the aisle, there's a ton of money waiting to be given to your opponent to make everybody think that you are a terrible person through negative advertising.
But the third class of reforms is that we've got to change the nature of social relationships in Congress.
The politicians I've met are generally very extroverted, friendly, very socially skillful people, and that's the nature of politics. You've got to make relationships, make deals, you've got to cajole, please, flatter, you've got to use your personal skills, and that's the way politics has always worked.
But beginning in the 1990s, first the House of Representatives changed its legislative calendar so that all business is basically done in the middle of the week.
Nowadays, Congressmen fly in on Tuesday morning, they do battle for two days, then they fly home Thursday afternoon.
They don't move their families to the District.
They don't meet each other's spouses or children.
There's no more relationship there.
And trying to run Congress without human relationships is like trying to run a car without motor oil.
Should we be surprised when the whole thing freezes up and descends into paralysis and polarization?
A simple change to the legislative calendar, such as having business stretch out for three weeks and then they get a week off to go home, that would change the fundamental relationships in Congress.
So there's a lot we can do, but who's going to push them to do it?
There are a number of groups that are working on this.
No Labels and Common Cause, I think, have very good ideas for changes we need to do to make our democracy more responsive and our Congress more effective.
But I'd like to supplement their work with a little psychological trick, and the trick is this.
Nothing pulls people together like a common threat or a common attack, especially an attack from a foreign enemy, unless of course that threat hits on our polarized psychology, in which case, as I said before, it can actually pull us apart.
Sometimes a single threat can polarize us, as we saw.
But what if the situation we face is not a single threat but is actually more like this, where there's just so much stuff coming in, it's just, "Start shooting, come on, everybody, we've got to just work together, just start shooting."
Because actually, we do face this situation.
This is where we are as a country.
So here's another asteroid.
We've all seen versions of this graph, right, which shows the changes in wealth since 1979, and as you can see, almost all the gains in wealth have gone to the top 20 percent, and especially the top one percent.
Rising inequality like this is associated with so many problems for a democracy.
Especially, it destroys our ability to trust each other, to feel that we're all in the same boat, because it's obvious we're not.
Some of us are sitting there safe and sound in gigantic private yachts.
Other people are clinging to a piece of driftwood.
We're not all in the same boat, and that means nobody's willing to sacrifice for the common good.
The left has been screaming about this asteroid for 30 years now, and the right says, "Huh, what? Hmm? No problem. No problem."
Now, why is that happening to us? Why is the inequality rising?
Well, one of the largest causes, after globalization, is actually this fourth asteroid, rising non-marital births.
This graph shows the steady rise of out-of-wedlock births since the 1960s.
Most Hispanic and black children are now born to unmarried mothers.
Whites are headed that way too.
Within a decade or two, most American children will be born into homes with no father.
This means that there's much less money coming into the house.
But it's not just money. It's also stability versus chaos.
As I know from working with street children in Brazil, Mom's boyfriend is often a really, really dangerous person for kids.
Now the right has been screaming about this asteroid since the 1960s, and the left has been saying, "It's not a problem. It's not a problem."
The left has been very reluctant to say that marriage is actually good for women and for children.
Now let me be clear. I'm not blaming the women here.
I'm actually more critical of the men who won't take responsibility for their own children and of an economic system that makes it difficult for many men to earn enough money to support those children.
But even if you blame nobody, it still is a national problem, and one side has been more concerned about it than the other.
The New York Times finally noticed this asteroid with a front-page story last July showing how the decline of marriage contributes to inequality.
We are becoming a nation of just two classes.
When Americans go to college and marry each other, they have very low divorce rates.
They earn a lot of money, they invest that money in their kids, some of them become tiger mothers, the kids rise to their full potential, and the kids go on to become the top two lines in this graph.
And then there's everybody else: the children who don't benefit from a stable marriage, who don't have as much invested in them, who don't grow up in a stable environment, and who go on to become the bottom three lines in that graph.
So once again, we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing.
As before, we've got a problem, we've got to start working on this, we've got to do something, and what's wrong with you people that you don't see my threat?
But if everybody could just take off their partisan blinders, we'd see that these two problems actually are best addressed together.
Because if you really care about income inequality, you might want to talk to some evangelical Christian groups that are working on ways to promote marriage.
But then you're going to run smack into the problem that women don't generally want to marry someone who doesn't have a job.
So if you really care about strengthening families, you might want to talk to some liberal groups who are working on promoting educational equality, who are working on raising the minimum wage, who are working on finding ways to stop so many men from being sucked into the criminal justice system and taken out of the marriage market for their whole lives.
So to conclude, there are at least four asteroids headed our way.
How many of you can see all four?
Please raise your hand right now if you're willing to admit that all four of these are national problems.
Please raise your hands.
Okay, almost all of you.
Well, congratulations, you guys are the inaugural members of the Asteroids Club, which is a club for all Americans who are willing to admit that the other side actually might have a point.
In the Asteroids Club, we don't start by looking for common ground.
Common ground is often very hard to find.
No, we start by looking for common threats because common threats make common ground.
Now, am I being naive? Is it naive to think that people could ever lay down their swords, and left and right could actually work together?
I don't think so, because it happens, not all that often, but there are a variety of examples that point the way.
This is something we can do.
Because Americans on both sides care about the decline in civility, and they've formed dozens of organizations, at the national level, such as this one, down to many local organizations, such as To The Village Square in Tallahassee, Florida, which tries to bring state leaders together to help facilitate that sort of working together human relationship that's necessary to solve Florida's problems.
Americans on both sides care about global poverty and AIDS, and on so many humanitarian issues, liberals and evangelicals are actually natural allies, and at times they really have worked together to solve these problems.
And most surprisingly to me, they sometimes can even see eye to eye on criminal justice.
For example, the incarceration rate, the prison population in this country has quadrupled since 1980.
Now this is a social disaster, and liberals are very concerned about this.
The Southern Poverty Law Center is often fighting the prison-industrial complex, fighting to prevent a system that's just sucking in more and more poor young men.
But are conservatives happy about this?
Well, Grover Norquist isn't, because this system costs an unbelievable amount of money.
And so, because the prison-industrial complex is bankrupting our states and corroding our souls, groups of fiscal conservatives and Christian conservatives have come together to form a group called Right on Crime.
And at times they have worked with the Southern Poverty Law Center to oppose the building of new prisons and to work for reforms that will make the justice system more efficient and more humane.
So this is possible. We can do it.
Let us therefore go to battle stations, not to fight each other, but to begin deflecting these incoming asteroids.
And let our first mission be to press Congress to reform itself, before it's too late for our nation.
Thank you.

<title>Jonathan Haidt: How common threats can make common ground</title>
<description>If an asteroid were headed for Earth, we'd all band together and figure out how to stop it, just like in the movies, right? And yet, when faced with major, data-supported, end-of-the-world problems in real life, too often we retreat into partisan shouting and stalemate. Jonathan Haidt shows us a few of the very real asteroids headed our way -- some pet causes of the left wing, some of the right -- and suggests how both wings could work together productively to benefit humanity as a whole.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_armstrong_architecture_that_repairs_itself.html</url>
All buildings today have something in common.
They're made using Victorian technologies.
This involves blueprints, industrial manufacturing and construction using teams of workers.
All of this effort results in an inert object.
And that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities.
This is not sustainable.
I believe that the only way that it is possible for us to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities is by connecting them to nature, not insulating them from it.
Now, in order to do this, we need the right kind of language.
Living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world, through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism.
And this is the conversion of one group of substances into another, either through the production or the absorption of energy.
And this is the way in which living materials make the most of their local resources in a sustainable way.
So, I'm interested in the use of metabolic materials for the practice of architecture.
But they don't exist. So I'm having to make them.
I'm working with architect Neil Spiller at the Bartlett School of Architecture, and we're collaborating with international scientists in order to generate these new materials from a bottom up approach.
That means we're generating them from scratch.
One of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanczyc, and he's really interested in the transition from inert to living matter.
Now, that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in, when we're thinking about sustainable materials.
So, Martin, he works with a system called the protocell.
Now all this is -- and it's magic -- is a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it.
And it has no DNA.
This little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living.
It is able to move around its environment.
It can follow chemical gradients.
It can undergo complex reactions, some of which are happily architectural.
So here we are. These are protocells, patterning their environment.
We don't know how they do that yet.
Here, this is a protocell, and it's vigorously shedding this skin.
Now, this looks like a chemical kind of birth.
This is a violent process.
Here, we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into carbonate.
And that's the shell around that globular fat.
They are quite brittle. So you've only got a part of one there.
So what we're trying to do is, we're trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom-up construction approaches for architecture, which contrast the current, Victorian, top-down methods which impose structure upon matter.
That can't be energetically sensible.
So, bottom-up materials actually exist today.
They've been in use, in architecture, since ancient times.
If you walk around the city of Oxford, where we are today, and have a look at the brickwork, which I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days, you'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone.
And if you look even closer, you'll see, in that limestone, there are little shells and little skeletons that are piled upon each other.
And then they are fossilized over millions of years.
Now a block of limestone, in itself, isn't particularly that interesting.
It looks beautiful.
But imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere.
Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide.
Would it give this block of limestone new properties?
Well, most likely it would. It might be able to grow.
It might be able to self-repair, and even respond to dramatic changes in the immediate environment.
So, architects are never happy with just one block of an interesting material.
They think big. Okay?
So when we think about scaling up metabolic materials, we can start thinking about ecological interventions like repair of atolls, or reclamation of parts of a city that are damaged by water.
So, one of these examples would of course be the historic city of Venice.
Now, Venice, as you know, has a tempestuous relationship with the sea, and is built upon wooden piles.
So we've devised a way by which it may be possible for the protocell technology that we're working with to sustainably reclaim Venice.
And architect Christian Kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city.
So, here is the technology we have today.
This is our protocell technology, effectively making a shell, like its limestone forefathers, and depositing it in a very complex environment, against natural materials.
We're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this.
Now, this is the very interesting part.
We don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals.
What we need it to do is to be creatively crafted around the wooden piles.
So, you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light, toward the dark foundations.
We've observed this in the laboratory.
The protocells can actually move away from the light.
They can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species.
So that these don't just exist as one entity, we kind of chemically engineer them.
And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone very specifically, around the foundations of Venice, effectively petrifying it.
Now, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while.
It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case-by-case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice.
But gradually, as the buildings are repaired, we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city.
An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide.
Also it will attract the local marine ecology, who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture.
So, this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way.
But perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere.
This is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it, which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for First World countries.
So, in summary, I'm generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to Victorian technologies, and building architectures from a bottom-up approach.
Secondly, these metabolic materials have some of the properties of living systems, which means they can perform in similar ways.
They can expect to have a lot of forms and functions within the practice of architecture.
And finally, an observer in the future marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one.
Thank you.

<title>Rachel Armstrong: Architecture that repairs itself?</title>
<description>Venice is sinking. To save it, Rachel Armstrong says we need to outgrow architecture made of inert materials and, well, make architecture that grows itself. She proposes a not-quite-alive material that does its own repairs and sequesters carbon, too.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/elyn_saks_seeing_mental_illness.html</url>
So I'm a woman with chronic schizophrenia.
I've spent hundreds of days in psychiatric hospitals.
I might have ended up spending most of my life on the back ward of a hospital, but that isn't how my life turned out.
In fact, I've managed to stay clear of hospitals for almost three decades, perhaps my proudest accomplishment.
That's not to say that I've remained clear of all psychiatric struggles.
After I graduated from the Yale Law School and got my first law job, my New Haven analyst, Dr. White, announced to me that he was going to close his practice in three months, several years before I had planned to leave New Haven.
White had been enormously helpful to me, and the thought of his leaving shattered me.
My best friend Steve, sensing that something was terribly wrong, flew out to New Haven to be with me.
Now I'm going to quote from some of my writings: "I opened the door to my studio apartment.
Steve would later tell me that, for all the times he had seen me psychotic, nothing could have prepared him for what he saw that day.
For a week or more, I had barely eaten.
I was gaunt. I walked as though my legs were wooden.
My face looked and felt like a mask.
I had closed all the curtains in the apartment, so in the middle of the day the apartment was in near total darkness.
The air was fetid, the room a shambles.
Steve, both a lawyer and a psychologist, has treated many patients with severe mental illness, and to this day he'll say I was as bad as any he had ever seen.
'Hi,' I said, and then I returned to the couch, where I sat in silence for several moments.
'Thank you for coming, Steve.
Crumbling world, word, voice.
Tell the clocks to stop.
Time is. Time has come.' 'White is leaving,' Steve said somberly.
'I'm being pushed into a grave. The situation is grave,' I moan.
'Gravity is pulling me down.
I'm scared. Tell them to get away.'" As a young woman, I was in a psychiatric hospital on three different occasions for lengthy periods.
My doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia, and gave me a prognosis of "grave."
That is, at best, I was expected to live in a board and care, and work at menial jobs.
Fortunately, I did not actually enact that grave prognosis.
Instead, I'm a chaired Professor of Law, Psychology and Psychiatry at the USC Gould School of Law, I have many close friends and I have a beloved husband, Will, who's here with us today.
Thank you.
He's definitely the star of my show.
I'd like to share with you how that happened, and also describe my experience of being psychotic.
I hasten to add that it's my experience, because everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way.
Let's start with the definition of schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia is a brain disease.
Its defining feature is psychosis, or being out of touch with reality.
Delusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of the illness.
Delusions are fixed and false beliefs that aren't responsive to evidence, and hallucinations are false sensory experiences.
For example, when I'm psychotic I often have the delusion that I've killed hundreds of thousands of people with my thoughts.
I sometimes have the idea that nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain.
Occasionally, I have hallucinations, like one time I turned around and saw a man with a raised knife.
Imagine having a nightmare while you're awake.
Often, speech and thinking become disorganized to the point of incoherence.
Loose associations involves putting together words that may sound a lot alike but don't make sense, and if the words get jumbled up enough, it's called "word salad."
Contrary to what many people think, schizophrenia is not the same as multiple personality disorder or split personality.
The schizophrenic mind is not split, but shattered.
Everyone has seen a street person, unkempt, probably ill-fed, standing outside of an office building muttering to himself or shouting.
This person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia.
But schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array of socioeconomic status, and there are people with the illness who are full-time professionals with major responsibilities.
Several years ago, I decided to write down my experiences and my personal journey, and I want to share some more of that story with you today to convey the inside view.
So the following episode happened the seventh week of my first semester of my first year at Yale Law School.
Quoting from my writings: "My two classmates, Rebel and Val, and I had made the date to meet in the law school library on Friday night to work on our memo assignment together.
But we didn't get far before I was talking in ways that made no sense.
'Memos are visitations,' I informed them.
'They make certain points. The point is on your head.
Pat used to say that. Have you killed you anyone?' Rebel and Val looked at me as if they or I had been splashed in the face with cold water.
'What are you talking about, Elyn?' 'Oh, you know, the usual. Who's what, what's who, heaven and hell. Let's go out on the roof.
It's a flat surface. It's safe.' Rebel and Val followed and they asked what had gotten into me.
'This is the real me,' I announced, waving my arms above my head.
And then, late on a Friday night, on the roof of the Yale Law School, I began to sing, and not quietly either.
'Come to the Florida sunshine bush.
Do you want to dance?' 'Are you on drugs?' one asked. 'Are you high?' 'High? Me? No way, no drugs.
Come to the Florida sunshine bush, where there are lemons, where they make demons.' 'You're frightening me,' one of them said, and Rebel and Val headed back into the library.
I shrugged and followed them.
Back inside, I asked my classmates if they were having the same experience of words jumping around our cases as I was.
'I think someone's infiltrated my copies of the cases,' I said.
'We've got to case the joint.
I don't believe in joints, but they do hold your body together.'" -- It's an example of loose associations. -- "Eventually I made my way back to my dorm room, and once there, I couldn't settle down.
My head was too full of noise, too full of orange trees and law memos I could not write and mass murders I knew I would be responsible for.
Sitting on my bed, I rocked back and forth, moaning in fear and isolation."
This episode led to my first hospitalization in America.
I had two earlier in England.
Continuing with the writings: "The next morning I went to my professor's office to ask for an extension on the memo assignment, and I began gibbering unintelligably as I had the night before, and he eventually brought me to the emergency room.
Once there, someone I'll just call 'The Doctor' and his whole team of goons swooped down, lifted me high into the air, and slammed me down on a metal bed with such force that I saw stars.
Then they strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed with thick leather straps.
A sound came out of my mouth that I'd never heard before: half groan, half scream, barely human and pure terror.
Then the sound came again, forced from somewhere deep inside my belly and scraping my throat raw."
This incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization.
One of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing me against my will was that I was "gravely disabled."
To support this view, they wrote in my chart that I was unable to do my Yale Law School homework.
I wondered what that meant about much of the rest of New Haven.
During the next year, I would spend five months in a psychiatric hospital.
At times, I spent up to 20 hours in mechanical restraints, arms tied, arms and legs tied down, arms and legs tied down with a net tied tightly across my chest.
I never struck anyone.
I never harmed anyone. I never made any direct threats.
If you've never been restrained yourself, you may have a benign image of the experience.
There's nothing benign about it.
Every week in the United States, it's been estimated that one to three people die in restraints.
They strangle, they aspirate their vomit, they suffocate, they have a heart attack.
It's unclear whether using mechanical restraints is actually saving lives or costing lives.
While I was preparing to write my student note for the Yale Law Journal on mechanical restraints, I consulted an eminent law professor who was also a psychiatrist, and said surely he would agree that restraints must be degrading, painful and frightening.
He looked at me in a knowing way, and said, "Elyn, you don't really understand: These people are psychotic.
They're different from me and you.
They wouldn't experience restraints as we would."
I didn't have the courage to tell him in that moment that, no, we're not that different from him.
We don't like to be strapped down to a bed and left to suffer for hours any more than he would.
In fact, until very recently, and I'm sure some people still hold it as a view, that restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe.
I've never met a psychiatric patient who agreed with that view.
Today, I'd like to say I'm very pro-psychiatry but very anti-force.
I don't think force is effective as treatment, and I think using force is a terrible thing to do to another person with a terrible illness.
Eventually, I came to Los Angeles to teach at the University of Southern California Law School.
For years, I had resisted medication, making many, many efforts to get off.
I felt that if I could manage without medication, I could prove that, after all, I wasn't really mentally ill, it was some terrible mistake.
My motto was the less medicine, the less defective.
My L.A. analyst, Dr. Kaplan, was urging me just to stay on medication and get on with my life, but I decided I wanted to make one last college try to get off.
Quoting from the text: "I started the reduction of my meds, and within a short time I began feeling the effects.
After returning from a trip to Oxford, I marched into Kaplan's office, headed straight for the corner, crouched down, covered my face, and began shaking.
All around me I sensed evil beings poised with daggers.
They'd slice me up in thin slices or make me swallow hot coals.
Kaplan would later describe me as 'writhing in agony.' Even in this state, what he accurately described as acutely and forwardly psychotic, I refused to take more medication.
The mission is not yet complete.
Immediately after the appointment with Kaplan, I went to see Dr. Marder, a schizophrenia expert who was following me for medication side effects.
He was under the impression that I had a mild psychotic illness.
Once in his office, I sat on his couch, folded over, and began muttering.
'Head explosions and people trying to kill.
Is it okay if I totally trash your office?' 'You need to leave if you think you're going to do that,' said Marder.
'Okay. Small. Fire on ice. Tell them not to kill me.
Tell them not to kill me. What have I done wrong?
Hundreds of thousands with thoughts, interdiction.' 'Elyn, do you feel like you're dangerous to yourself or others?
I think you need to be in the hospital.
I could get you admitted right away, and the whole thing could be very discrete.' 'Ha, ha, ha.
You're offering to put me in hospitals?
Hospitals are bad, they're mad, they're sad.
One must stay away. I'm God, or I used to be.'" At that point in the text, where I said "I'm God, or I used to be," my husband made a marginal note.
He said, "Did you quit or were you fired?"
"'I give life and I take it away.
Forgive me, for I know not what I do.' Eventually, I broke down in front of friends, and everybody convinced me to take more medication.
I could no longer deny the truth, and I could not change it.
The wall that kept me, Elyn, Professor Saks, separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past, lay smashed and in ruins."
Everything about this illness says I shouldn't be here, but I am. And I am, I think, for three reasons: First, I've had excellent treatment.
Four- to five-day-a-week psychoanalytic psychotherapy for decades and continuing, and excellent psychopharmacology.
Second, I have many close family members and friends who know me and know my illness.
These relationships have given my life a meaning and a depth, and they also helped me navigate my life in the face of symptoms.
Third, I work at an enormously supportive workplace at USC Law School.
This is a place that not only accommodates my needs but actually embraces them.
It's also a very intellectually stimulating place, and occupying my mind with complex problems has been my best and most powerful and most reliable defense against my mental illness.
Even with all that — excellent treatment, wonderful family and friends, supportive work environment — I did not make my illness public until relatively late in life, and that's because the stigma against mental illness is so powerful that I didn't feel safe with people knowing.
If you hear nothing else today, please hear this: There are not "schizophrenics."
There are people with schizophrenia, and these people may be your spouse, they may be your child, they may be your neighbor, they may be your friend, they may be your coworker.
So let me share some final thoughts.
We need to invest more resources into research and treatment of mental illness.
The better we understand these illnesses, the better the treatments we can provide, and the better the treatments we can provide, the more we can offer people care, and not have to use force.
Also, we must stop criminalizing mental illness.
It's a national tragedy and scandal that the L.A. County Jail is the biggest psychiatric facility in the United States.
American prisons and jails are filled with people who suffer from severe mental illness, and many of them are there because they never received adequate treatment.
I could have easily ended up there or on the streets myself.
A message to the entertainment industry and to the press: On the whole, you've done a wonderful job fighting stigma and prejudice of many kinds.
Please, continue to let us see characters in your movies, your plays, your columns, who suffer with severe mental illness.
Portray them sympathetically, and portray them in all the richness and depth of their experience as people and not as diagnoses.
Recently, a friend posed a question: If there were a pill I could take that would instantly cure me, would I take it?
The poet Rainer Maria Rilke was offered psychoanalysis.
He declined, saying, "Don't take my devils away, because my angels may flee too."
My psychosis, on the other hand, is a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifying that all my angels have already fled.
So would I take the pill? In an instant.
That said, I don't wish to be seen as regretting the life I could have had if I'd not been mentally ill, nor am I asking anyone for their pity.
What I rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share is more important than the mental illness we may not.
What those of us who suffer with mental illness want is what everybody wants: in the words of Sigmund Freud, "to work and to love."
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. You're very kind.
Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_thrun_google_s_driverless_car.html</url>
As a boy, I loved cars.
When I turned 18, I lost my best friend to a car accident.
Like this.
And then I decided I'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year.
Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report, but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars.
I saw the concept first in the DARPA Grand Challenges where the U.S. government issued a prize to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert.
And even though a hundred teams were there, these cars went nowhere.
So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car.
We built the hardware and the software.
We made it learn from us, and we set it free in the desert.
And the unimaginable happened: it became the first car to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge, winning Stanford 2 million dollars.
Yet I still hadn't saved a single life.
Since, our work has focused on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves -- any street in California.
We've driven 140,000 miles.
Our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving.
It's the perfect driving mechanism.
We've driven in cities, like in San Francisco here.
We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1.
We've encountered joggers, busy highways, toll booths, and this is without a person in the loop; the car just drives itself.
In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles, people didn't even notice.
Mountain roads, day and night, and even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco.
Sometimes our cars get so crazy, they even do little stunts.
Oh, my God.
What?
Second It's driving itself.
Sebastian Thrun: Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life, but I can do something for all the people who died.
Do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people?
And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error, and can therefore be prevented by machines?
Do you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of two or three if we didn't rely on human precision on staying in the lane -- improve body position and therefore drive a little bit closer together on a little bit narrower lanes, and do away with all traffic jams on highways?
Do you realize that you, TED users, spend an average of 52 minutes per day in traffic, wasting your time on your daily commute?
You could regain this time.
This is four billion hours wasted in this country alone.
And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted.
Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology, and I'm really looking forward to a time when generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars.
Thank you.

<title>Sebastian Thrun: Google's driverless car</title>
<description>Sebastian Thrun helped build Google's amazing driverless car, powered by a very personal quest to save lives and reduce traffic accidents. Jawdropping video shows the DARPA Challenge-winning car motoring through busy city traffic with no one behind the wheel, and dramatic test drive footage from TED2011 demonstrates how fast the thing can really go.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/rob_harmon_how_the_market_can_keep_streams_flowing.html</url>
This is a river.
This is a stream.
This is a river.
This is happening all over the country.
There are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the United States.
On this map, the colored areas represent water conflicts.
Similar problems are emerging in the east as well.
The reasons vary state to state, but mostly in the details.
There are 4,000 miles of dewatered streams in Montana alone.
They would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife.
They're the veins of the ecosystem, and they're often empty veins.
I want to tell you the story of just one of these streams because it's an archetype for the larger story.
This is Prickly Pear Creek.
It runs through a populated area from East Helena to Lake Helena.
It supports wild fish including cutthroat, brown and rainbow trout.
Nearly every year for more than a hundred years, it's looked like this in the summer.
How did we get here?
Well, it started back in the late 1800s when people started settling in places like Montana.
In short, there was a lot of water and there weren't very many people.
But as more people showed up wanting water, the folks who were there first got a little concerned, and in 1865, Montana passed its first water law.
It basically said, everybody near the stream can share in the stream.
Oddly, a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream, and the folks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers.
There were precedent-setting suits in 1870 and 1872, both involving Prickly Pear Creek.
And in 1921, the Montana Supreme Court ruled in a case involving Prickly Pear that the folks who were there first had the first, or "senior water rights."
These senior water rights are key.
The problem is that all over the west now it looks like this.
Some of these creeks have claims for 50 to 100 times more water than is actually in the stream.
And the senior water rights holders, if they don't use their water right, they risk losing their water right, along with the economic value that goes with it.
So they have no incentive to conserve.
So it's not just about the number of people; the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you don't use it.
So after decades of lawsuits and 140 years, now, of experience, we still have this.
It's a broken system.
There's a disincentive to conserve, because, if you don't use your water right, you can lose your water right.
And I'm sure you all know, this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities.
Okay. Now I'm going to change gears here.
Most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation's free, and some of you'll be happy to know that it involves beer.
There's another thing happening around the country, which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint.
They're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water, they're trying to be really efficient with their water use, and they're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand.
Well, it's a national problem, but I'm going to tell you another story from Montana, and it involves beer.
I bet you didn't know, it takes about 5 pints of water to make a pint of beer.
If you include all the drain, it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer.
Now the brewers in Montana have already done a lot to reduce their water consumption, but they still use millions of gallons of water.
I mean, there's water in beer.
So what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem?
These ecosystems are really important to the Montana brewers and their customers.
After all, there's a strong correlation between water and fishing, and for some, there's a strong correlation between fishing and beer.
So the Montana brewers and their customers are concerned, and they're looking for some way to address the problem.
So how can they address this remaining water footprint?
Remember Prickly Pear.
Up until now, business water stewardship has been limited to measuring and reducing, and we're suggesting that the next step is to restore.
Remember Prickly Pear.
It's a broken system.
You've got a disincentive to conserve, because if you don't use your water right, you risk losing your water right.
Well, we decided to connect these two worlds -- the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks.
In some states, senior water rights holders can leave their water in-stream while legally protecting it from others and maintaining their water right.
After all, it is their water right, and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream, it's their right to do so.
But they have no incentive to do so.
So, working with local water trusts, we created an incentive to do so.
We pay them to leave their water in-stream.
That's what's happening here.
This individual has made the choice and is closing this water diversion, leaving the water in the stream.
He doesn't lose the water right, he just chooses to apply that right, or some portion of it, to the stream, instead of to the land.
Because he's the senior water rights holder, he can protect the water from other users in the stream.
Okay?
He gets paid to leave the water in the stream.
This guy's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream.
We then take the measured water, we divide it into thousand-gallon increments.
Each increment gets a serial number and a certificate, and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems.
The brewers pay to restore water to the stream.
It provides a simple, inexpensive and measurable way to return water to these degraded ecosystems, while giving farmers an economic choice and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints an easy way to deal with them.
After 140 years of conflict and 100 years of dry streams, a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved, we put together a market-based, willing buyer, willing seller solution -- It's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints a real opportunity to put water where it's critically needed, into these degraded ecosystems, while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice about how their water is used.
These transactions create allies, not enemies.
They connect people rather than dividing them.
And they provide needed economic support for rural communities.
And most importantly, it's working.
We've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems.
We've connected senior water rights holders with brewers in Montana, with hotels and tea companies in Oregon and with high-tech companies that use a lot of water in the Southwest.
And when we make these connections, we can and we do turn this into this.
Thank you very much.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/tavi_gevinson_a_teen_just_trying_to_figure_it_out.html</url>
Four years ago today, exactly, actually, I started a fashion blog called Style Rookie.
Last September of 2011, I started an online magazine for teenage girls called Rookiemag.com.
My name's Tavi Gevinson, and the title of my talk is "Still Figuring It Out," and the MS Paint quality of my slides was a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme, and has nothing to do with my inability to use PowerPoint.
So I edit this site for teenage girls. I'm a feminist.
I am kind of a pop culture nerd, and I think a lot about what makes a strong female character, and, you know, movies and TV shows, these things have influence. My own website.
So I think the question of what makes a strong female character often goes misinterpreted, and instead we get these two-dimensional superwomen who maybe have one quality that's played up a lot, like a Catwoman type, or she plays her sexuality up a lot, and it's seen as power.
But they're not strong characters who happen to be female.
They're completely flat, and they're basically cardboard characters.
The problem with this is that then people expect women to be that easy to understand, and women are mad at themselves for not being that simple, when, in actuality, women are complicated, women are multifaceted -- not because women are crazy, but because people are crazy, and women happen to be people.
So the flaws are the key.
I'm not the first person to say this.
What makes a strong female character is a character who has weaknesses, who has flaws, who is maybe not immediately likable, but eventually relatable.
I don't like to acknowledge a problem without also acknowledging those who work to fix it, so just wanted to acknowledge shows like "Mad Men," movies like "Bridesmaids," whose female characters or protagonists are complex, multifaceted.
Lena Dunham, who's on here, her show on HBO that premiers next month, "Girls," she said she wanted to start it because she felt that every woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions, and that feels accurate for all people, but you don't see women represented like that as much.
Congrats, guys.
But I don't feel that — I still feel that there are some types of women who are not represented that way, and one group that we'll focus on today are teens, because I think teenagers are especially contradictory and still figuring it out, and in the '90s there was "Freaks and Geeks" and "My So-Called Life," and their characters, Lindsay Weir and Angela Chase, I mean, the whole premise of the shows were just them trying to figure themselves out, basically, but those shows only lasted a season each, and I haven't really seen anything like that on TV since.
So this is a scientific diagram of my brain — — around the time when I was, when I started watching those TV shows.
I was ending middle school, starting high school -- I'm a sophomore now — and I was trying to reconcile all of these differences that you're told you can't be when you're growing up as a girl.
You can't be smart and pretty.
You can't be a feminist who's also interested in fashion.
You can't care about clothes if it's not for the sake of what other people, usually men, will think of you.
So I was trying to figure all that out, and I felt a little confused, and I said so on my blog, and I said that I wanted to start a website for teenage girls that was not this kind of one-dimensional strong character empowerment thing because I think one thing that can be very alienating about a misconception of feminism is that girls then think that to be a feminist, they have to live up to being perfectly consistent in your beliefs, never being insecure, never having doubts, having all of the answers. And this is not true, and, actually, reconciling all the contradictions I was feeling became easier once I understood that feminism was not a rulebook but a discussion, a conversation, a process, and this is a spread from a zine that I made last year when I -- I mean, I think I've let myself go a bit on the illustration front since.
But, yeah.
So I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publication for teenage girls and ask people to submit their writing, their photography, whatever, to be a member of our staff.
I got about 3,000 emails.
My editorial director and I went through them and put together a staff of people, and we launched last September.
And this is an excerpt from my first editor's letter, where I say that Rookie, we don't have all the answers, we're still figuring it out too, but the point is not to give girls the answers, and not even give them permission to find the answers themselves, but hopefully inspire them to understand that they can give themselves that permission, they can ask their own questions, find their own answers, all of that, and Rookie, I think we've been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out.
So I'm not saying, "Be like us," and "We're perfect role models," because we're not, but we just want to help represent girls in a way that shows those different dimensions.
I mean, we have articles called "On Taking Yourself Seriously: How to Not Care What People Think of You," but we also have articles like, oops -- I'm figuring it out!
Ha ha.
If you use that, you can get away with anything.
We also have articles called "How to Look Like You Weren't Just Crying in Less than Five Minutes."
So all of that being said, I still really appreciate those characters in movies and articles like that on our site, that aren't just about being totally powerful, maybe finding your acceptance with yourself and self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those.
So what I you to take away from my talk, the lesson of all of this, is to just be Stevie Nicks.
Like, that's all you have to do.
Because my favorite thing about her, other than, like, everything, is that she is very -- has always been unapologetically present on stage, and unapologetic about her flaws and about reconciling all of her contradictory feelings and she makes you listen to them and think about them, and yeah, so please be Stevie Nicks.
Thank you.

So what does the happiest man in the world look like?
He certainly doesn't look like me.
He looks like this.
His name is Matthieu Ricard.
So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world?
Well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain.
And you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI, versus the right prefrontal cortex.
And Matthieu's happiness measure is off the charts.
He's by far the happiest man ever measured by science.
Which leads us to a question: What was he thinking when he was being measured?
Perhaps something very naughty.
Actually, he was meditating on compassion.
Matthieu's own experience is that compassion is the happiest state ever.
Reading about Matthieu was one of the pivotal moments of my life.
My dream is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime -- and to do that by creating the conditions for inner peace and compassion on a global scale.
And learning about Matthieu gave me a new angle to look at my work.
Matthieu's brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore.
Compassion is something that creates happiness.
Compassion is fun.
And that mind-blowing insight changes the entire game.
Because if compassion was a chore, nobody's going to do it, except maybe the Dalai Lama or something.
But if compassion was fun, everybody's going to do it.
Therefore, to create the conditions for global compassion, all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun.
But fun is not enough.
What if compassion is also profitable?
What if compassion is also good for business?
Then, every boss, every manager in the world, will want to have compassion -- like this.
That would create the conditions for world peace.
So, I started paying attention to what compassion looks like in a business setting.
Fortunately, I didn't have to look very far.
Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes -- in Google, my company.
I know there are other compassionate companies in the world, but Google is the place I'm familiar with because I've been there for 10 years, so I'll use Google as the case study.
Google is a company born of idealism.
It's a company that thrives on idealism.
And maybe because of that, compassion is organic and widespread company-wide.
In Google, expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern.
It's sort of a funny pattern.
It starts with a small group of Googlers taking the initiative to do something.
And they don't usually ask for permission; they just go ahead and do it, and then other Googlers join in, and it just gets bigger and bigger.
And sometimes it gets big enough to become official.
So in other words, it almost always starts from the bottom up.
And let me give you some examples.
The first example is the largest annual community event -- where Googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities -- was initiated and organized by three employees before it became official, because it just became too big.
Another example, three Googlers -- a chef, an engineer and, most funny, a massage therapist -- three of them, they learned about a region in India where 200,000 people live without a single medical facility.
So what do they do?
They just go ahead and start a fundraiser.
And they raise enough money to build this hospital -- the first hospital of its kind for 200,000 people.
During the Haiti earthquake, a number of engineers and product managers spontaneously came together and stayed overnight to build a tool to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones.
And expressions of compassion are also found in our international offices.
In China for example, one mid-level employee initiated the largest social action competition in China, involving more than 1,000 schools in China, working on issues such as education, poverty, health care and the environment.
There is so much organic social action all around Google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts.
And this idea, again, came from the grassroots, from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job.
And I found it fascinating that the social responsibility team was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy.
It was two persons saying, "Let's do this," and the company said, "Yes."
So it turns out that Google is a compassionate company, because Googlers found compassion to be fun.
But again, fun is not enough.
There are also real business benefits.
So what are they?
The first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders.
What does that mean?
There are three components of compassion.
There is the affective component, which is, "I feel for you."
There is the cognitive component, which is, "I understand you."
And there is a motivational component, which is, "I want to help you."
So what has this got to do with business leadership?
According to a very comprehensive study led by Jim Collins, and documented in the book "Good to Great," it takes a very special kind of leader to bring a company from goodness to greatness.
And he calls them "Level 5 leaders."
These are leaders who, in addition to being highly capable, possess two important qualities, and they are humility and ambition.
These are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good.
And because they're ambitious for a greater good, they feel no need to inflate their own egos.
And they, according to the research, make the best business leaders.
And if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion, we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion -- understanding people and empathizing with people -- inhibits, tones down, what I call the excessive self-obsession that's in us, therefore creating the conditions for humility.
The motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good.
In other words, compassion is the way to grow Level 5 leaders.
And this is the first compelling business benefit.
The second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce.
Employees mutually inspire each other towards greater good.
It creates a vibrant, energetic community where people admire and respect each other.
I mean, you come to work in the morning, and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in India.
It's like how can you not be inspired by those people -- your own coworkers?
So this mutual inspiration promotes collaboration, initiative and creativity.
It makes us a highly effective company.
So, having said all that, what is the secret formula for brewing compassion in the corporate setting?
In our experience, there are three ingredients.
The first ingredient is to create a culture of passionate concern for the greater good.
So always think: how is your company and your job serving the greater good?
Or, how can you further serve the greater good?
This awareness of serving the greater good is very self-inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in.
That's one.
The second ingredient is autonomy.
So in Google, there's a lot of autonomy.
And one of our most popular managers jokes that, this is what he says, "Google is a place where the inmates run the asylum."
And he considers himself one of the inmates.
If you already have a culture of compassion and idealism and you let your people roam free, they will do the right thing in the most compassionate way.
The third ingredient is to focus on inner development and personal growth.
Leadership training in Google, for example, places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities, such as self-awareness, self-mastery, empathy and compassion, because we believe that leadership begins with character.
We even created a seven-week curriculum on emotion intelligence, which we jokingly call "Searching Inside Yourself."
It's less naughty than it sounds.
So I'm an engineer by training, but I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course, which I find kind of funny, because this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotion intelligence.
What a company.
So "Search Inside Yourself" -- how does it work?
It works in three steps.
The first step is attention training.
Attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities.
Therefore, any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training.
The idea here is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time.
And this creates the foundation for emotion intelligence.
The second step follows the first step.
The second step is developing self-knowledge and self-mastery.
So using the supercharged attention from step one, we create a high-resolution perception into the cognitive and emotive processes.
What does that mean?
It means being able to observe our thought stream and the process of emotion with high clarity, objectivity and from a third-person perspective.
And once you can do that, you create the kind of self-knowledge that enables self-mastery.
The third step, following the second step, is to create new mental habits.
What does that mean? Imagine this.
Imagine whenever you meet any other person, any time you meet a person, your habitual, instinctive first thought is, "I want you to be happy.
I want you to be happy."
Imagine you can do that.
Having this habit, this mental habit, changes everything at work.
Because this good will is unconsciously picked up by other people, and it creates trust, and trust creates a lot of good working relationships.
And this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace.
Someday, we hope to open-source "Search Inside Yourself" so that everybody in the corporate world will at least be able to use it as a reference.
And in closing, I want to end the same place I started, with happiness.
I want to quote this guy -- the guy in robes, not the other guy -- the Dalai Lama, who said, "If you want others to be happy, practice compassion.
If you want to be happy, practice compassion."
I found this to be true, both on the individual level and at a corporate level.
And I hope that compassion will be both fun and profitable for you too.
Thank you.

<title>Chade-Meng Tan: Everyday compassion at Google</title>
<description>Google's "Jolly Good Fellow," Chade-Meng Tan, talks about how the company practices compassion in its everyday business -- and its bold side projects.</description>
<keywords>business,charter for compassion,culture</keywords>
<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/karen_tse_how_to_stop_torture.html</url>
In 1994, I walked into a prison in Cambodia, and I met a 12-year-old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel.
And as I looked into his eyes, I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political prisoners, that I would never have written a letter for him, because he was not a 12-year-old boy who had done something important for anybody.
He was not a political prisoner.
He was a 12-year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle.
What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia, but of the 113 developing countries that torture, 93 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured.
And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool.
We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst, but, in fact, 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners.
It is for people who are in broken-down legal systems, and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation -- it's cheaper than having a legal system, cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel -- it is what happens most of the time.
I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community, if we make a decision, to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime, but it will require three things.
First is the training, empowerment, and connection of defenders worldwide.
The second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel.
And the third is commitment.
So in the year 2000, I began to wonder, what if we came together?
Could we do something for these 93 countries?
And I founded International Bridges to Justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in courtrooms.
My first experiences, though, did come from Cambodia, and at the time I remember first coming to Cambodia and there were, in 1994, still less than 10 attorneys in the country because the Khmer Rouge had killed them all.
And even 20 years later, there was only 10 lawyers in the country, so consequently you'd walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year-old boys, you'd meet women and you'd say, "Why are you here?" Women would say, "Well I've been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime, but they can't find him."
So it's just a place where there was no rule of law.
The first group of defenders came together and I still remember, as I was training, I said, "Okay, what do you do for an investigation?"
And there was silence in the class, and finally one woman stood up, [inaudible name], and she said "Khrew," which means "teacher."
She said, "I have defended more than a hundred people, and I've never had to do any investigation, because they all come with confessions."
And we talked about, as a class, the fact that number one, the confessions might not be reliable, but number two, we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this, especially as it was now against the law.
And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws.
And I still remember the first cases where they came, all 25 together, she would stand up, and they were in the back, and they would support her, and the judges kept saying, "No, no, no, no, we're going to do things the exact same way we've been doing them."
But one day the perfect case came, and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller, she was sitting outside of a house.
She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was, but the police came, they got her, there was nothing on her.
She was pregnant at the time. She had cigarette burns on her. She'd miscarried.
And when they brought her case to the judge, for the first time he stood up and he said, "Yes, there's no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released."
And the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see, they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cambodia.
But Cambodia is not alone.
I used to think, well is it Cambodia?
Or is it other countries?
But it is in so many countries.
In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn't a 12-year-old boy, it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone.
Or a woman, I picked up her baby, really cute baby, I said "Your baby is so cute."
It wasn't a baby, she was three.
And she said "Yeah, but she's why I'm here," because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison.
And when I walked up to the prison director, I said, "You've got to let her out.
A judge would let her out."
And he said, "Okay, we can talk about it, but look at my prison. Eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer. What can we do?"
So lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases.
But we realized that it's not only the training of the lawyers, but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference.
For example, in Cambodia, it was that [inaudible name] did not go alone but she had 24 lawyers with her who stood up together. And in the same way, in China, they always tell me, "It's like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together."
Or in Zimbabwe, where I remember Innocent, after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said, "I've been here for one year, eight years, 12 years without a lawyer," he came and we had a training together and he said, "I have heard it said" -- because he had heard people mumbling and grumbling -- "I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources."
And then he said, "But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice."
And with that, he successfully organized 68 lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases.
The key that we see, though, is training and then early access.
I was recently in Egypt, and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers, and what they told me is that they said, "Hey, look, we don't have police on the streets now. The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution. They were torturing everybody all the time."
And I said, "But there's been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here.
What's going on?"
I met with one of the development agencies, and they were training prosecutors and judges, which is the normal bias, as opposed to defenders.
And they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual.
I said, "I'm gonna copy this."
It had everything in it. Lawyers can come at the police station. It was perfect.
Prosecutors were perfectly trained.
But I said to them, "I just have one question, which is, by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor's office, what had happened to them?"
And after a pause, they said, "They had been tortured."
So the pieces are, not only the training of the lawyers, but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel, because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured.
And as I tell you this, I'm also aware of the fact that it sounds like, "Oh, okay, it sounds like we could do it, but can we really do it?"
Because it sounds big.
And there are many reasons why I believe it's possible.
The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment.
It's not only Innocent, who I told you about in Zimbabwe, but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces.
We have a program called JusticeMakers, and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things, but how can we support them?
So it's an online contest where it's only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice.
And there are 30 JusticeMakers throughout the world, from Sri Lanka to Swaziland to the DRC, who with five thousand dollars do amazing things, through SMS programs, through paralegal programs, through whatever they can do.
And it's not only these JusticeMakers, but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward.
So in China, for instance, great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished.
And I was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers, and said, "How can we get this out? How can we make sure that this is implemented?
This is fantastic." And he said to me, "Well, do you have money?" And I said, "No." And he said, "That's okay, we can still figure it out."
And on December 4, he organized three thousand members of the Youth Communist League, from 14 of the top law schools, who organized themselves, developed posters with the new laws, and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights.
So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders.
We need to systematically implement early access to counsel.
But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this.
And people often say to me, "You know, this is great, but it's wildly idealistic.
Never going to happen."
And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery, or end apartheid.
It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit.
Now, there's one of our favorite poems from the defenders, which they share from each other, is: "Take courage friends, the road is often long, the path is never clear, and the stakes are very high, but deep down, you are not alone."
And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders, but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it, we can end torture as an investigative tool.
I end always, because I'm sure the questions are -- and I'd be happy to talk to you at any point -- "But what can I really do?"
Well, I would say this. First of all, you know what you can do. But second of all, I would leave you with the story of Vishna, who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bridges to Justice.
Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambodian prison in Kandal Province. But because he was born in the prison, everybody loved him, including the guards, so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars.
So, you know, there's bars. And by the time that Vishna was getting bigger, which means what gets bigger? Your head gets bigger.
So he would come to the first bar, the second bar and then the third bar, and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through, and come back, third, second, first. And he would grab my pinkie, because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit.
You know, he never quite made it to all of them every day, but he wanted to visit all 156 prisoners. And I would lift him, and he would put his fingers through.
Or if they were dark cells, it was like iron corrugated, and he would put his fingers through.
And most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine, and they looked forward to him. And I was like, here's Vishna. He's a 4-year-old boy.
He was born in a prison with almost nothing, no material goods, but he had a sense of his own heroic journey, which I believe we are all born into. He said, "Probably I can't do everything.
But I'm one. I can do something.
And I will do the one thing that I can do."
So I thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together, and invite you into this journey with us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be.
And in my idea, heaven is satisfied curiosity.
I think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud where I can just lie down with my belly down, like I was watching TV when I was a child, and my elbows up.
And I can basically look everywhere I want, see every movie I've always wanted to see.
And in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in New York when you're reading, there's something really soothing and easy.
Well, the funny thing is that I already have that kind of life, in a way, because I discovered ...
it took me a while to understand it, but when I discovered around 24 years of age that I was much more comfortable with objects than with people, I finally decided to really embrace this passion.
And I basically live my life in sort of a trance, and I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story.
Just to give you an example: this is the exhibition, Humble Masterpieces, as it was at MoMA in 2004.
We were in Queens, we were building the big, big, big, big building in Midtown, so we were in the small, small, small boondocks.
That was one of the funnest moments of my career.
But it's not only that.
The typeface -- the typeface is Helvetica; it's its 50th anniversary this year.
And so I start thinking -- Max Miedinger and all those Swiss designers together, trying to outdo Akzidenz-Grotesk, and come up with a new sans-serif typeface -- and the movie starts playing in my head already.
And of course, you can imagine, with Humble Masterpieces it was the same thing multiplied by a hundred.
And I do hope, by the way, that the real goal of the exhibition is going to have the same effect on you.
The exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ...
you know when they do homeworks at home?
Instead of having a tray with two peas, I was hoping that they would go into the kitchen cabinet or the mother's handbag and do their museum-quality design collection on a tray.
So, everybody's always suggesting new humble masterpieces, and at MoMA we put out some books just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces.
And when you do that, usually you get 80 percent porn and 20 percent real suggestions, and instead it was all -- almost -- all good suggestions.
And a lot of nationalism came in.
For instance, I didn't know that the Spaniards invented the mop, but they were very proud so every Spaniard said "la frego." And Italians did the pizza.
And I wanted to show you, also, the suggestions from Kentucky are pretty good -- they had moonshine, laundry detergents and liquid nails.
And I keep it going, and I just got, also, this suggestion from Milan: it's our traffic divider, which we call "panettone," and it's painted; it's these beautiful concrete things that you use around Milan to define all the lanes of traffic.
So, think of your own, send them on if you want to -- they're always welcome.
But an exhibition like that made me understand even more what I've been thinking of for 13 years ever since I got to MoMA.
I'm Italian. In Italy, design is normal.
Different parts of the world have a knack for different things.
I was just recently in Argentina and in Uruguay, and the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism that you don't see elsewhere, but the contemporary art was terrible.
In Italy, in Milan especially, contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place.
But design -- oh, my God.
What you find at the store at the corner, without going to any kind of fancy store, is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that we are all so sophisticated.
It's just what you find at the store.
And New York has another kind of knack for contemporary art.
I'm always amazed -- three-year-olds know who Richard Serra is and take you to the galleries.
But design, for some reason, is still misunderstood for decoration.
It's really interesting: what many people think when I say the word "design" is they think of this kind of overdesigned -- in this case, it's overdesigned on purpose, but -- decoration, interior decoration.
They think of somebody choosing fabrics.
Design can be that, of course, but it can also be this.
It can be a school of design in Jerusalem that tries to find a better way to design gas masks for people, because, as you know, Israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies.
So, what these designers do is they find a way to lower the neckline, so that instead of being completely strangled, a teenager can also sip a Coke.
They tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important.
And then they make a little tent for the baby.
However cruel, however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design, and it is miles away from the fancy furniture, but still, it's part of my same field of passion.
What I've been doing at MoMA since the beginning is to try to harness the power of MoMA because it's great to work there. You really have power in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions, and that is power because in a design museum I wouldn't have as many visitors.
I'm very well aware that 80 percent of my public is there to see Picasso and Matisse, and then they stumble upon my show and I keep them there.
But what I've been trying to do is something that the curators at MoMA in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in 1929, which is to try and see what's going on in the world and try to use that authority in order to make things better.
There have been many episodes, and actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience, but in two instances, his great-grandfather, grandfather -- I'm always a little perplexed about the relation, exactly -- Charles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time were involved in two competitions: one in 1940, it was about organic furniture, and the second one in 1948 was low-cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war that then sparked a whole line of furniture.
And then there was good design for very low price.
There were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life.
So, I started out in '95 with this exhibition that was called Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design.
It was about a new phase, in my opinion, in the world of design in that materials could be customized by the designers themselves.
And that put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels from the Lawrence Livermore Lab in California; at that time, they were beginning to be brought into the civilian market.
And at the same time, the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro, who did these beautiful salt-and-pepper containers that are made of rice dough.
So you see, the range is really quite diverse.
And then, for instance, this other exhibition that was entitled Workspheres in 2001, where I asked different designers to come up with ideas for the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time.
And you see IDEO there.
It was beautiful -- it was called Personal Skies.
The idea was that if you had a cubicle, you could project a sky on top of your head and have your own "Cielo in Una Stanza" -- a sky in a room -- it's a very famous Italian song.
And other examples: this was Marti Guixe about working on the go, and Hella Jongerius, my favorite, about how to work at home.
And this lets me introduce a very important idea about design: designers are the biggest synthesizers in the world.
What they do best is make a synthesis of human needs, current conditions in economy, in materials, in sustainability issues, and then what they do at the end -- if they are good -- is much more than the sum of its parts.
Hella Jongerius is a person that is able to make a synthesis that is really quite amazing and also quite hilarious.
The idea behind her work was that at that time, everybody was saying you have to really divide your life.
Instead, she said, "No, no. Work and leisure can be together."
Yeah, that's particularly gorgeous -- it's the TV dinner of 2001.
There have been many other exhibitions in the meantime, but I don't want to focus on my shows.
I would like, instead, to talk about how great some designers are.
I've always had a hard time with the word "maverick."
I came to the United States 13 years ago, and to this day I have to ask, "What does that mean?"
So, this morning I went to see on the dictionary and it said that there was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle.
Therefore, he was not following everybody's lead, and therefore, he was a maverick.
So, designers do need to be mavericks, because the best way to design a successful object -- and also an object that we were missing before -- is to pretend that either it never existed or that people will be able to have a new behavior with it.
So, Safe is the last exhibition that I did at MoMA and it ended at the beginning of last year.
It was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection.
It's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called Emergency.
And then when 9/11 happened, I had a shock and I canceled the exhibition until, slowly but surely, it came back -- as a half-full glass instead of half-empty -- and it was about protection and safety.
But it ranged from such items as a complete de-mining equipment to these kind of water-sterilizing straws, so it was really wide-ranging.
It also had ... you know, Cameron and I worked a little bit together, and some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition.
But what is interesting is that we don't need to talk about design and art anymore; design uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point.
It's a sense of economy and a sense, also, of humor.
This is a beautiful project by Ralph Borland, who's South African.
It's a suit for civil disobedience.
The idea is that when you have a riot or a protest and the police comes towards you, you're wearing this thing -- it's like a big heart and it has a loudspeaker over your heart so your heartbeat is amplified -- and the police is reminded; it's like having a flower in front of the rifle.
And also, you can imagine, a whole group of people with the same suit will have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police.
So, designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately functional, but they're functional to our understanding of issues.
Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia, like this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor so it disappears completely and you can hide away; or even better, the huggable atomic mushroom, which got me an article on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States -- I don't think it ever happened before at MoMA; or this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations.
But the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that the ultimate shelter is your sense of self, and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic.
This is Cindy van den Bremen, who is a Dutch designer that's done this series of Capsters.
They are athletic gear for Muslim women that enable them to ski, play tennis, do whatever they want to do without having to uncap themselves.
And sometimes by doing this kind of research, you encounter such beautiful ideas of design.
Twan Verdonck is really young, I think he's 27, and working together with some psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial stimulation for children that have psychological impairments.
They're quite beautiful.
They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you -- because autistic children like to be hugged tight, so it has a spring inside -- all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self.
Design really looks upon the whole world and it considers the world in all of its different ranges.
I was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the Herald Tribune in Istanbul.
And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury, and I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality.
And the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury, and there's luxury that is relative for people that don't have that much.
I want to make this point by showing you two examples of design coming from a sense of economy -- very, very clear limits.
This is Cuba, and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell, and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks.
So they're quite beautiful, but they're beautiful because they're so smart and economical.
And here is the work of two brothers from Sao Paulo, Fernando and Humberto Campana, who got inspired by the poverty and smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are selling for an enormous amount of money.
But that's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself.
So really, design takes everything into account, and the interesting thing is that as the technology advances, as we become more and more wireless and impalpable, designers, instead, want us to be hands-on.
Sometimes hammer-on.
This is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically.
Even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes your imprint, all the way to this beautiful series of objects that are considered design by Ana Mir in Barcelona.
From this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples to these intra-toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes.
It's quite beautiful because somehow, this is a gorgeous moment for design.
Many years ago I heard a mathematician from Vienna, whose name was Marchetti, explain how the innovation in the military industry -- therefore, secret innovation -- and the innovation in the civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed.
And that makes sense.
In moments of war there's great technological innovation, and in the world you have to do without -- well, during the Second World War, you had to do without steel, you had to do without aluminum.
And then as peace comes, all of these technologies get all of a sudden available for the civilian market.
Many of you might know that the Potato Chip Chair by Charles and Ray Eames comes exactly from that kind of instance: fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden.
I think that this is a strange moment.
The rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously, just like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years, so I'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is.
But it surely is a very important moment for design, because not only is the technology proceeding, not only is computing technology making open-source possible also in the world of design, but also the idea of sustainability -- which is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of CO2 emissions and footprint, but also sustainability of human interrelationships -- is very much part of the work of so many designers.
And that's why designers, more and more, are working on behaviors rather than on objects.
Especially the good ones, not all of them.
I wanted to show you, for instance, the work of Mathieu Lehanneur, which is quite fantastic.
He's another young designer from France who's working -- and at this point he's working, also, with pharmaceutical companies -- on new ways to engage patients, especially children, in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty.
For instance, this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine that kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine, so the child has to go -- pffff! -- to release and relieve the container itself.
And this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin, so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved in this particular kind of delivery.
Similarly, there's the work of people like Marti Guixe that tries to involve you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste, orally.
The next show that I'm going to work on -- and I've been bugging a lot of you about this here -- is about the relationship between design and science.
I'm trying to find not the metaphors, but, rather, the points in common -- the common gripes, the common issues, the common preoccupations -- and I think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design as an instruction, as a direction rather than a prescription of form.
And I am hoping that many of you will respond to this.
I've sent an email already to quite a few of you.
But design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales, and therefore, really work at the scale of the very small to make it very big and very meaningful.
Thank you.

So what's image got do with it?
And I must say, I think Emeka is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages, because I'm going to keep harping on some of the issues that have come up.
But I'm going to try and do something different, and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories, and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we've been talking about.
So, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions, as you can see.
We're not the only ones.
And you know, it's amazing.
I mean, we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent.
Just think about that, you know?
And this is typically what we've been talking about, the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff.
Now, why is that a problem?
A typical disaster story: disease, corruption, poverty.
And some of you might be standing here thinking, saying, "OK, you know, Ory, you're Harvard-educated, and all you privileged people come here, saying, 'Forget the poor people.
Let's focus on business and the markets, and whatever.' " And they're all, "There's the 80 percent of Africans who really need help."
And I want to tell you that this is my story, OK?
And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here.
We start with poverty.
I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire, but I know what it is to grow up without having money, or being able to support family.
Euvin was talking about bellwether signs.
The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast.
You know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages.
When things were bad, we had porridge.
And like many African families, my parents could never save because they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents, and things were always dicey.
Now, when I was born, they realized they had a pretty smart kid, and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school, which was free.
And they adopted a very interesting approach to education, which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford.
So they took me to a private, Catholic, elementary school, which set the foundation for what ended up being my career.
And what happened was, because they could afford it sometimes, sometimes not, I got kicked out pretty much every term.
You know, someone would come in with a list of the people who haven't paid school fees, and when they started getting pretty strict, you had to leave, until your school fees could be paid.
And I remember thinking, I mean, why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school?
Because you know, as a kid you're embarrassed and you're sensitive, and everyone knows you guys don't have money.
But they kept at it, and I now understand why they did what they did.
They talk about corruption.
In Kenya, we have an entrance exam to go into high school.
And there's national schools, which are like the best schools, and provincial schools.
My dream school at that time was Kenya High School, a national school.
I missed the cutoff by one point.
And I was so disappointed, and I was like, "Oh my God, you know, what am I going to do?"
And my father said, "OK, listen.
Let's go and try and talk to the headmistress.
You know, it's just one point. I mean, maybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there."
So we went to the school, and because we were nobodies, and because we didn't have privilege, and because my father didn't have the right last name, he was treated like dirt.
And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him, saying, you know, who do you think you are?
And, you know, you must be joking if you think you can get a slot.
And I had gone to school with other girls, who were kids of politicians, and who had done much, much worse than I did, and they had slots there.
And there's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you, you know?
And we left, and I swore to myself, and I was like, "I'm never, ever going to have to beg for anything in my life."
They called me two weeks later, they're like, oh, yeah, you can come now. And I told them to stuff it.
Final story, and I sort of have to speak quickly.
Disease.
My father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999.
He never told anyone that he had AIDS, his fear of the stigma was so strong.
And I'm pretty much the one who figured it out, because I was a nerd.
And I was in the States at the time, and they called me. He was very sick, the first time he got sick.
And he had Cryptococcal meningitis.
And so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know.
Because of doctor-patient privilege, they couldn't really tell us what was going on.
But they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing.
And when I went online and looked at the infectious -- read about the disease, I pretty much realized what was going on.
The first time he got sick, he recovered.
But what happened was that he had to be on medication that, at that time -- Diflucan, which in the States is used for yeast infections -- cost 30 dollars a pill.
He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life.
You know, so money ran out.
He got sick again.
And up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India, and he used to import, bring him, could get him a generic version of it.
And that kept him going.
But the money ran out.
He got sick again. He got sick on a Friday.
At that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya, and we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash for him to start the treatment until Monday.
The hospital put him on a water drip for three days.
And finally, we figured, well, OK, we'd better just try and take him to a public hospital.
At least he'll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation.
And he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him.
And, you know, now, imagine if -- and I could go on and on -- imagine if this is all you know about me.
How would you look at me?
With pity, you know. Sadness.
And this is how you look at Africa.
This is the damage it causes.
You don't see the other side of me.
You don't see the blogger, you don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer, the vibrant person, you know?
And I just wanted to personalize that.
Because we talk about it in big terms, and you wonder, you know, so what?
But it's damaging.
And I'm not unique, right?
Imagine if all you knew about William was the fact that he grew up in a poor village.
And you didn't know about the windmill, you know?
And I was just moved.
I was actually crying during his presentation.
He was like, I try and I make.
I was like Nike should hire him, you know, "Just do it!"
And this is, again, the point I'm trying to make.
When you focus just on the disasters -- -- we're ignoring the potential.
So, what is to be done?
First of all, Africans, we need to get better at telling our stories.
We heard about that yesterday.
We had some of them this morning.
blogging is one way of doing that.
Afrigator is an aggregator of African blogs that was developed in South Africa.
So we need to start getting better.
If no one else will tell our stories, let's do it.
And going back to the point I was trying to make, this is the Swahili Wikipedia.
Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa.
It only has five contributors.
Four of them are white males -- non-native speakers.
The other person is -- Ndesanjo, if you're here, stand up -- is a Tanzanian, [the] first Swahili blogger.
He's the only African who's contributing to this.
People, please. We can't whine and complain the West is doing this.
What are we doing?
Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers?
Why are we not generating our own content?
You know, it's not enough to complain. We need to act.
Reuters now integrates African blogs into their coverage of Africa.
So, that's a start, and we've heard of all their other initiatives.
The cheetah generation.
The aid approach, you know, is flawed.
And after all the hoopla of Live 8, we're still not anywhere in the picture.
No, you're not.
But the point I'm trying to make, though, is that it's not enough for us to criticize.
And for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should I be, should I move back, should I stay?
You know, just jump.
The continent needs you.
And I can't emphasize that enough, you know.
I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C., Covington and Burling, six figures.
With two paychecks, or three paychecks, I could solve a lot of my family's problems.
But I walked away from that, because my passion was here, and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling.
And because I'm needed here, you know?
I probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a Harvard Law School degree because of all the things I'm doing.
One is because I'm pretty aggressive, and I try and find, you know, opportunities.
But there is such a need, you know?
I'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called Enablis that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa.
We're now moving into East Africa.
And we give them business development services, as well as financing loan and equity.
I've also set up a project in Kenya, and what we do is we track the performance of Kenyan MPs.
My partner, M, who's a tech guru, hacked WordPress.
It costs us, like, 20 dollars a month just for hosting.
Everything else on there is a labor of love.
We've manually entered all the data there.
And you can get profiles of each MP, questions they've asked in parliament.
We have a comment function, where people can ask their MPs questions.
There are some MPs who participate, and come back and ask.
And basically, we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians.
You know, I believe that accountability stems from demand.
You're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart.
And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders.
What are they doing?
You know, they're not going to change just out of nowhere.
So we need new policies, we need -- where's that coming from, you know?
Another thing is that these leaders are a reflection of our society.
We talk about African governments like they've been dropped from Mars, you know?
They come from us.
And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like?
And how can we change that?
So Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable.
Where do we go from here?
I believe in the power of ideas.
I believe in the power of sharing knowledge.
And I'd ask all of you, when you leave here, please just share, and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going, because it can make a difference.
The other thing I want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual.
I've had lots of conversations about things I think need to be happening in Africa.
People are like, "OK, if you don't do aid, I'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?"
And when I talk about my ideas, they're like, "BBut it's not scalable, you know.
Give me something I can do with Paypal."
It's not that easy, you know?
And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual, in the fellows you've met, and the businesspeople you've met, it can make a huge difference, especially in Africa, because usually the individual in Africa carries a lot of people behind them.
Practically. I mean, when I was a first-year student in law school, my mom's business had collapsed, so I was supporting her.
My sister was struggling to get through undergrad.
I was helping her pay her tuition.
My cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart.
I was paying her school fees.
A cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan, so we said, well, what are we going to do with her?
You know, she's now my baby sister.
And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me, I am able to lift all those people.
So, don't underestimate that.
An example. This man changed my life.
He's a professor. He's now at Vanderbilt.
He's an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson.
And because of him, I got into Harvard Law School, because he took an interest.
I was taking a class of his, and he was just like, this is an overeager student, which we don't normally get in the United States, because everyone else is cynical and jaded.
He called me to his office and said, "What do you want to do when you grow up?"
I said, "I want to be a lawyer."
And he was like, "Why? You know, we don't need another lawyer in the United States."
And he tried to talk me out of it, but it was like, "OK, I know nothing about applying to law school, I'm poli-sci Ph.D.
But, you know, let's figure out what I need you to do, what I need to do to help you out."
It was like, "Where do you want to go?"
And to me at that time university -- I was at University of Pitts for undergrad, and that was like heaven, OK, because compared to what could have been in Kenya.
So I'm like, "Yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school."
He was like, "Why? You know, you're smart, you have all these things going for you."
And I'm like, "Because I'm here and it's cheap, and you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh."
Like, that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard for applying to law school.
And, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me.
And he said, "Look, you can get into Harvard, you're that good, OK?
And if they don't admit you, they're the ones who are messed up."
And he built me up, you know?
And this is just an illustration.
You can meet other individuals here.
We just need a push.
That's all I needed was a push to go to the next level.
Basically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know?
A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave the continent so that we can fulfill our potential.
You know, my vision is that my daughter, and any other African child being born today, can be whoever they want to be here, without having to leave.
And they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born.
That's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know?
That you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances, and you can move.
Just because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever, that doesn't define who you are.
For most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born, and the circumstances under which you were born, determine the rest of your life.
I would like to see that change, and the change starts with us.
And as Africans, we need to take responsibility for our continent.
Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/may_el_khalil_making_peace_is_a_marathon.html</url>
I come from Lebanon, and I believe that running can change the world.
I know what I have just said is simply not obvious.
You know, Lebanon as a country has been once destroyed by a long and bloody civil war.
Honestly, I don't know why they call it civil war when there is nothing civil about it.
With Syria to the north, Israel and Palestine to the south, and our government even up till this moment is still fragmented and unstable.
For years, the country has been divided between politics and religion.
However, for one day a year, we truly stand united, and that's when the marathon takes place.
I used to be a marathon runner.
Long distance running was not only good for my well-being but it helped me meditate and dream big.
So the longer distances I ran, the bigger my dreams became, until one fateful morning, and while training, I was hit by a bus.
I nearly died, was in a coma, stayed at the hospital for two years, and underwent 36 surgeries to be able to walk again.
As soon as I came out of my coma, I realized that I was no longer the same runner I used to be, so I decided, if I couldn't run myself, I wanted to make sure that others could.
So out of my hospital bed, I asked my husband to start taking notes, and a few months later, the marathon was born.
Organizing a marathon as a reaction to an accident may sound strange, but at that time, even during my most vulnerable condition, I needed to dream big.
I needed something to take me out of my pain, an objective to look forward to.
I didn't want to pity myself, nor to be pitied, and I thought by organizing such a marathon, I'll be able to pay back to my community, build bridges with the outside world, and invite runners to come to Lebanon and run under the umbrella of peace.
Organizing a marathon in Lebanon is definitely not like organizing one in New York.
How do you introduce the concept of running to a nation that is constantly at the brink of war?
How do you ask those who were once fighting and killing each other to come together and run next to each other?
More than that, how do you convince people to run a distance of 26.2 miles at a time they were not even familiar with the word "marathon"?
So we had to start from scratch.
For almost two years, we went all over the country and even visited remote villages.
I personally met with people from all walks of life -- mayors, NGOs, schoolchildren, politicians, militiamen, people from mosques, churches, the president of the country, even housewives.
I learned one thing: When you walk the talk, people believe you.
Many were touched by my personal story, and they shared their stories in return.
It was honesty and transparency that brought us together.
We spoke one common language to each other, and that was from one human to another.
Once that trust was built, everybody wanted to be part of the marathon to show the world the true colors of Lebanon and the Lebanese and their desire to live in peace and harmony.
In October 2003, over 6,000 runners from 49 different nationalities came to the start line, all determined, and when the gunfire went off, this time it was a signal to run in harmony for a change.
The marathon grew.
So did our political problems.
But for every disaster we had, the marathon found ways to bring people together.
In 2005, our prime minister was assassinated, and the country came to a complete standstill, so we organized a five-kilometer United We Run campaign.
Over 60,000 people came to the start line, all wearing white t-shirts with no political slogans.
That was a turning point for the marathon, where people started looking at it as a platform for peace and unity.
Between 2006 up to 2009, our country, Lebanon, went through unstable years, invasions, and more assassinations that brought us close to a civil war.
The country was divided again, so much that our parliament resigned, we had no president for a year, and no prime minister.
But we did have a marathon.
So through the marathon, we learned that political problems can be overcome.
When the opposition party decided to shut down part of the city center, we negotiated alternative routes.
Government protesters became sideline cheerleaders.
They even hosted juice stations.
You know, the marathon has really become It gained credibility from both the Lebanese and the international community.
Last November 2012, over 33,000 runners from 85 different nationalities came to the start line, but this time, they challenged very stormy and rainy weather.
The streets were flooded, but people didn't want to miss of such a national day.
BMA has expanded.
We include everyone: the young, the elderly, the disabled, the mentally challenged, the blind, the elite, the amateur runners, even moms with their babies.
Themes have included runs for the environment, breast cancer, for the love of Lebanon, for peace, or just simply to run.
The first annual all-women-and-girls race for empowerment, which is one of its kind in the region, has just taken place only a few weeks ago, with 4,512 women, including the first lady, and this is only the beginning.
Thank you.
BMA has supported charities and volunteers who have helped reshape Lebanon, raising funds for their causes and encouraging others to give.
The culture of giving and doing good has become contagious.
Stereotypes have been broken.
Change-makers and future leaders have been created.
I believe these are the building blocks for future peace.
BMA has become such a respected event in the region that government officials in the region like Iraq, Egypt and Syria, have asked the organization to help them structure a similar sporting event.
We are now one of the largest running events in the Middle East, but most importantly, it is a platform for hope and cooperation in an ever-fragile and unstable part of the world.
From Boston to Beirut, we stand as one.
After 10 years in Lebanon, from national marathons or from national events to smaller regional races, we've seen that people want to run for a better future.
After all, peacemaking is not a sprint.
It is more of a marathon.
Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/myshkin_ingawale_a_blood_test_without_bleeding.html</url>
I like to build stuff.
My team at Biosense, a startup I co-founded with my doctor and engineer friends, has built a technology called ToucHB, which can do blood testing of hemoglobin without pricks, without needles.
I believe this is going to democratize health care.
They're two big words, I don't know what they mean.
In fact, in 2009, I was even more clueless.
I had absolutely no idea what was going to happen next.
I was, in fact, busy trying to finish off my Ph.D., which was in a completely unrelated area of how people interact, contributors interact, how articles are formed in Wikipedia -- trying to figure out how quality emerges from the system.
I was also building something called the Copenhagen Wheel, which is just a really beautiful, beautiful electric bike at a lab at MIT called SENSEable City Lab.
I was lucky enough that I visited Mumbai, my house, back for a vacation.
So at that time I was planning a road trip.
I visited a place called Parol about two hours north of Mumbai.
This is a place where my friend, Abhishek Sen was interning.
He's a doctor there.
And that's his actual photograph.
So Abhishek actually made me wait.
He was out there in Parol delivering a baby.
I was waiting, and when he did emerge, he was ashen-faced.
He told me that there had been two deaths; the mother and child both had died.
The reason, he told me, was something called post partum hemorrhage.
He explained this meant severe internal bleeding.
What was really shocking for me was that he said that this is entirely due to undiagnosed anemia.
Now anemia -- I'm an engineer, but even I knew -- that anemia is something which is not supposed to be fatal.
It is something which probably the cure is known.
I mean, folic acid, iron tablets -- very cheap, affordable cures exist to control anemia.
So why was this woman dying?
It was completely preventable.
Five minutes away from there, I had the center, the medical center, which was distributing subsidized iron tablets.
So the whole nature of this thing completely shocked me.
And I knew that there had to be a way to prevent this.
My mom is a pediatrician, and I asked her.
She told me that this is how you would typically test for anemia.
Take a blood sample and run it through a machine called a Coulter counter.
This is a $10,000 machine which was available in Mumbai.
It's also available here or in any part, I guess, in Europe and most cities in the world.
But this is not available in Parol.
Also, that woman who was operating the machine, the technician, is not available in Parol.
Now this struck me as -- I love to fix things. I wanted to fix this.
I got a friend of mine, an engineer, and three other doctors -- Abhishek joined the team -- and we wanted to solve this problem.
By the time I step down from here there will be 10 people who have lost their lives through a completely, completely preventable problem.
Now let me take you back to Parol.
You saw the woman there, the nurse.
In India this is called an ASHA worker.
It's essentially a village health worker, a matron.
She is really the center of the health care system.
Public health care runs on the ASHA worker, not the doctor.
Now we knew we had to design something which she could use.
We knew it had to be these three things that the machine had to have.
We knew it had to be something which had no needles, no pricking, so it would have adoption, it would not have medical waste, all those problems.
It had to be simple enough for that woman ASHA worker to use.
And thirdly, it had to be something which she could carry in her kit.
She goes village to village doing screenings.
We thought we could build it, so we built it.
But, but it didn't work.
So we built it again.
And we did this 32 times.
But I'm very excited to tell you that last year we did build it -- it works.
And I have it here in my purse.
So this is a machine called the ToucHB Quik.
What it does is it measures my hemoglobin, oxygen and pulse rate.
I put it on my finger, switch it on, and in about 20 seconds it'll give me, on the little screen here, a value of hemoglobin, oxygen saturation and heart rate.
This will help ASHA workers diagnose anemia at the point of care.
I'll explain a little bit about how it works.
You might have seen a little light inside of it.
In fact, there are three lights in there, three wavelengths of light.
And we essentially pass light right through the tissue, and from understanding how much of it is transmitted, how much of it is scattered and how much of it is absorbed, we can figure out And this is something which is based on a principle called photoplethysmography.
We are actually really very excited about what else non-invasive techniques like this will be able to crack in the future.
One of the things which my intern here, Pratesh, built is a mobile application, which can now send all this data anywhere it wants to go.
There's a bunch of very exciting stuff which we are doing.
I would love to tell you a little bit more about it.
But fundamentally, what I believe is that the map behind of me is called basically the map of anemia.
It's the death rates caused by anemia globally.
You'll notice, of course, that there are hot spots -- South Asia, Africa.
My business plan is very simple.
I'm just going to sell these to every clinic in the world.
That's a simple bottom-line business plan.
And by the time I'm done, in 2020, when the WHO publishes the data again, this is going to be the map of anemia.
Thank you.

All right, all right.
So more than just explosions, chemistry is everywhere.
Have you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out just doing this over and over?
Some people nodding yes.
Recently, I showed this to my students, and I just asked them to try and explain why it happened.
The questions and conversations that followed were fascinating.
Check out this video that Maddie from my period three class sent me that evening.
Now obviously, as Maddie's chemistry teacher, I love that she went home and continued to geek out about this kind of ridiculous demonstration that we did in class.
But what fascinated me more is that Maddie's curiosity took her to a new level.
If you look inside that beaker, you might see a candle.
Maddie's using temperature to extend this phenomenon to a new scenario.
You know, questions and curiosity like Maddie's are magnets that draw us towards our teachers, and they transcend all technology or buzzwords in education.
But if we place these technologies before student inquiry, we can be robbing ourselves of our greatest tool as teachers: our students' questions.
For example, flipping a boring lecture from the classroom to the screen of a mobile device might save instructional time, but if it is the focus of our students' experience, it's the same dehumanizing chatter just wrapped up in fancy clothing.
But if instead we have the guts to confuse our students, perplex them, and evoke real questions, through those questions, we as teachers have information that we can use to tailor robust and informed methods of blended instruction.
So, 21st-century lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside, the truth is, I've been teaching for 13 years now, and it took a life-threatening situation to snap me out of 10 years of pseudo-teaching and help me realize that student questions are the seeds of real learning, not some scripted curriculum that gave them tidbits of random information.
In May of 2010, at 35 years old, with a two-year-old at home and my second child on the way, I was diagnosed with a large aneurysm at the base of my thoracic aorta.
This led to open-heart surgery. This is the actual real email from my doctor right there.
Now, when I got this, I was -- press Caps Lock -- absolutely freaked out, okay?
But I found surprising moments of comfort in the confidence that my surgeon embodied.
Where did this guy get this confidence, the audacity of it?
So when I asked him, he told me three things.
He said first, his curiosity drove him to ask hard questions about the procedure, about what worked and what didn't work.
Second, he embraced, and didn't fear, the messy process of trial and error, the inevitable process of trial and error.
And third, through intense reflection, he gathered the information that he needed to design and revise the procedure, and then, with a steady hand, he saved my life.
Now I absorbed a lot from these words of wisdom, and before I went back into the classroom that fall, I wrote down three rules of my own that I bring to my lesson planning still today.
Rule number one: Curiosity comes first.
Questions can be windows to great instruction, but not the other way around.
Rule number two: Embrace the mess.
We're all teachers. We know learning is ugly.
And just because the scientific method is allocated to page five of section 1.2 of chapter one of the one that we all skip, okay, trial and error can still be an informal part of what we do every single day at Sacred Heart Cathedral in room 206.
And rule number three: Practice reflection.
What we do is important. It deserves our care, but it also deserves our revision.
Can we be the surgeons of our classrooms?
As if what we are doing one day will save lives.
Our students our worth it.
And each case is different.
All right. Sorry.
The chemistry teacher in me just needed to get that out of my system before we move on.
So these are my daughters.
On the right we have little Emmalou -- Southern family.
And, on the left, Riley.
Now Riley's going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here.
She's going to be four years old, and anyone who knows a four-year-old knows that they love to ask, "Why?"
Yeah. Why.
I could teach this kid anything because she is curious about everything.
We all were at that age.
But the challenge is really for Riley's future teachers, the ones she has yet to meet.
How will they grow this curiosity?
You see, I would argue that Riley is a metaphor for all kids, and I think dropping out of school comes in many different forms -- to the senior who's checked out before the year's even begun or that empty desk in the back of an urban middle school's classroom.
But if we as educators leave behind this simple role as disseminators of content and embrace a new paradigm as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry, we just might bring a little bit more meaning to their school day, and spark their imagination.
Thank you very much.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/fahad_al_attiya_a_country_with_no_water.html</url>
Salaam alaikum.
Welcome to Doha.
I am in charge of making this country's food secure.
That is my job for the next two years, to design an entire master plan, and then for the next 10 years to implement it -- of course, with so many other people.
But first, I need to talk to you about a story, which is my story, about the story of this country that you're all here in today.
And of course, most of you have had three meals today, and probably will continue to have after this event.
So going in, what was Qatar in the 1940s?
We were about 11,000 people living here.
There was no water. There was no energy, no oil, no cars, none of that.
Most of the people who lived here either lived in coastal villages, fishing, or were nomads who roamed around with the environment trying to find water.
None of the glamour that you see today existed.
No cities like you see today in Doha or Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Kuwait or Riyadh.
It wasn't that they couldn't develop cities.
Resources weren't there to develop them.
And you can see that life expectancy was also short.
Most people died around the age of 50.
So let's move to chapter two: the oil era.
1939, that's when they discovered oil.
But unfortunately, it wasn't really fully exploited commercially until after the Second World War.
What did it do?
It changed the face of this country, as you can see today and witness.
It also made all those people who roamed around the desert -- looking for water, looking for food, trying to take care of their livestock -- urbanize.
You might find this strange, but in my family we have different accents.
My mother has an accent that is so different to my father, and we're all a population of about 300,000 people in the same country.
There are about five or six accents in this country as I speak.
Someone says, "How so? How could this happen?"
Because we lived scattered.
We couldn't live in a concentrated way simply because there was no resources.
And when the resources came, be it oil, we started building these fancy technologies and bringing people together because we needed the concentration.
People started to get to know each other.
And we realized that there are some differences in accents.
So that is the chapter two: the oil era.
Let's look at today.
This is probably the skyline that most of you know about Doha.
So what's the population today?
It's 1.7 million people.
That is in less than 60 years.
The average growth of our economy is about 15 percent for the past five years.
Lifespan has increased to 78.
Water consumption has increased to 430 liters.
And this is amongst the highest worldwide.
From having no water whatsoever to consuming water to the highest degree, higher than any other nation.
I don't know if this was a reaction to lack of water.
But what is interesting about the story that I've just said?
The interesting part is that we continue to grow 15 percent every year for the past five years without water.
Now that is historic. It's never happened before in history.
Cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water.
This is history being made in this region.
Not only cities that we're building, but cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists, doctors.
Build a nice home, bring the architect, design my house.
These people are adamant that this is a livable space when it wasn't.
But of course, with the use of technology.
So Brazil has 1,782 millimeters per year of precipitation of rain.
Qatar has 74, and we have that growth rate.
The question is how.
How could we survive that?
We have no water whatsoever.
Simply because of this gigantic, mammoth machine called desalination.
Energy is the key factor here. It changed everything.
It is that thing that we pump out of the ground, we burn tons of, probably most of you used it coming to Doha.
So that is our lake, if you can see it.
That is our river.
That is how you all happen to use and enjoy water.
This is the best technology that this region could ever have: desalination.
So what are the risks?
Do you worry much?
I would say, perhaps if you look at the global facts, you will realize, of course I have to worry.
There is growing demand, growing population.
We've turned seven billion only a few months ago.
And so that number also demands food.
And there's predictions that we'll be nine billion by 2050.
So a country that has no water has to worry about what happens beyond its borders.
There's also changing diets.
By elevating to a higher socio-economic level, they also change their diet.
They start eating more meat and so on and so forth.
On the other hand, there is declining yields because of climate change and because of other factors.
And so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen.
This is the situation in Qatar, for those who don't know.
We only have two days of water reserve.
We import 90 percent of our food, and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land.
The limited number of farmers that we have have been pushed out of their farming practices as a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions, etc., etc.
So we also face risks.
These risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity.
The question is, is there a solution?
Is there a sustainable solution?
Indeed there is.
This slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents that we've been working on over the past two years.
Let's start with the water.
So we know very well -- I showed you earlier -- that we need this energy.
So if we're going to need energy, what sort of energy?
A depletable energy? Fossil fuel?
Or should we use something else?
Do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy?
I guess most of you by now realize that we do: 300 days of sun.
And so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need.
And we will probably put 1,800 megawatts of solar systems to produce 3.5 million cubic meters of water.
And that is a lot of water.
That water will go then to the farmers, and the farmers will be able to water their plants, and they will be able then to supply society with food.
But in order to sustain the horizontal line -- because these are the projects, these are the systems that we will deliver -- we need to also develop the vertical line: system sustenance, high-level education, research and development, industries, technologies, to produce these technologies for application, and finally markets.
But what gels all of it, what enables it, is legislation, policies, regulations.
Without it we can't do anything.
So that's what we are planning to do.
Within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan and taking it to implementation.
Our objective is to be a millennium city, just like many millennium cities around: Istanbul, Rome, London, Paris, Damascus, Cairo.
We are only 60 years old, but we want to live forever as a city, to live in peace.
Thank you very much.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/srdja_popovic_how_to_topple_a_dictator.html</url>
Good afternoon. I am proud to be here at TEDxKrakow.
I'll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon which can and is actually changing the world, and whose name is people power.
I'll start with the anecdote, or for those of you who are Monty Python lovers, a Monty Python type of sketch.
Here it is. It is December 15, 2010.
Somebody gives you a bet. You will look at a crystal ball and you will see the future. The future will be accurate.
But you need to share it with the world. Okay?
Curiosity killed the cat. You take the bet.
You look at the crystal ball. One hour later, you are sitting in a building on the national TV in a talkshow, and you tell the story.
"Before the end of 2011, Ben Ali and Mubarak and Gaddafi will be down and prosecuted.
Saleh of Yemen and Assad of Syria would be either challenged or already on their knees.
Osama bin Laden will be dead, and Ratko Mladic will be in the Hague."
Now, the anchor watches you with a strange gaze on his face, and then on the top of it you add, "And thousands of the young people from Athens, Madrid and New York will demonstrate for social justice, claiming that they are inspired with Arabs."
Next thing you know, two guys in white appear.
They give you the strange t-shirt, take you to the nearest mental institution.
So I would like to speak a little bit about the phenomenon which is behind what already seems to be the very bad year for bad guys, and this phenomenon is called people power.
Well, people power has been there for a while.
It helped Gandhi kick the Brits from India.
It helped Martin Luther King win a historic racial struggle.
It helped local Lech Walesa to kick out one million Soviet troops from Poland and beginning the end of the Soviet Union as we know it.
So what's new in it? What seems to be very new, which is the idea I would like to share with you today, that there is a set of rules and skills which can be learned and taught in order to perform successful nonviolent struggle.
If this is true, we can help these movements.
Well, first one, analytic skills.
I'll try where it all started in the Middle East, and for so many years we were living with completely the wrong perception of the Middle East.
It was looking like the frozen region, literally a refrigerator, and there are only two types of meals there: steak, which stands for a Mubarak, Ben Ali-type of military police dictatorship, or a potato, which stands for Tehran types of theocracies.
And everybody was amazed when the refrigerator opened and millions of young, mainly secular people step out to do the change. Guess what? They didn't watch the demographics.
What is the average age of Egyptians? 24.
How long was Mubarak in power? 31.
So this system: just obsolete. They expired, and young people of the Arab World have awakened one morning and understood that power lies in their hands.
The rest is the year in front of us. And guess what?
The same Generation Epsilon with their rules, with their tools, with their games and with their language, which sounds a little bit strange to me. I am 38 now.
And can you look at the age of the people on the streets of Europe?
It seems that Generation Epsilon is coming.
Now let me set another example.
I'm meeting different people throughout the world, and they are, you know, academics and professors and doctors, and they will always talk conditions.
They will say, "People power will work only if the regime is not too oppressive."
They will say, "People power will work if the annual income of the country is between X and Z."
They will say, "People power will work only if there is a foreign pressure."
They will say, "People power will work only if there is no oil."
And, I mean, there is a set of conditions.
Well, the news here is that your skills [that you] bring in the conflict seem to be more important than the conditions, namely skills of unity, planning, and maintaining nonviolent discipline.
Let me give you the example.
I am coming from a country called Serbia.
It took us 10 years to unite 18 opposition party leaders, with their big egos, behind one single candidate against Balkan dictator Slobodan Milosevic.
Guess what? That was the day of his defeat.
You look at the Egyptians, they fire on Tahrir Square, they get rid of their individual symbols.
They appear on the street only with the flag of Egypt.
I will give you a counter-example.
You see nine presidential candidates running against Lukashenko.
You will know the outcome.
So unity is a big thing, and this can be achieved.
Same with planning. Somebody has lied to you about the successful and spontaneous nonviolent revolution?
That thing doesn't exist in the world.
Whenever you see young people in front of the road trying to fraternize with the police or military, somebody was thinking about it before.
Now, at the end, nonviolent discipline, and this is probably the game-changer.
If you maintain nonviolent discipline, you will exclusively win.
You have 100,000 people in a nonviolent march, and one idiot or agent provocateur is throwing stones, guess what takes all the cameras? That one guy.
One single act of violence can literally destroy your movement.
Now let me move to another place.
It's selection of strategies and tactics.
There are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow.
First, you start small.
Second, you pick the battles you can win.
It's only 200 of us in this room.
We won't call for the March of Millions.
But what if we organize spraying graffiti throughout the night all over Krakow city? The city will know.
So we pick the tactics which accommodates to the event, especially this thing we call the small tactics of dispersion.
They're very useful in a violent oppression.
We are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used.
It was on Tahrir Square, where the international community was constantly frightened that the Islamists will overtake the revolution. Well, they've organized Christians protecting Muslims, who are there praying, Coptic wedding cheered by thousands of Muslims.
The world has just changed the picture, but somebody was thinking about this previously.
So there are so many things you can do instead of getting into one place, shouting and showing off in front of the security forces.
Now there is also another very important dynamic, and this is a dynamic normally analytics don't see.
This is dynamics between fear and apathy on one side and enthusiasm and humor on another side.
So it works like in a video game.
You have a fear high, you have status quo.
You have enthusiasm higher, you see fear starting to melt.
Day two, you see people running towards police instead of from the police.
In Egypt, you can tell that something is happening there.
And then it's about humor. Humor is such a powerful game-changer, and of course it was very big in Poland.
And you know, we were just a small group of crazy students in Serbia when we made this big skit.
We put the big petrol barrel with a portrait picture of Mr. President on it in the middle of the Main Street. There was a hole on the top so you could literally come, put a coin in, get a baseball bat, and pow, hit his face.
Sounds loud. And within the minutes, we were sitting in a nearby cafe having coffee, and there was a queue of people waiting to do this lovely thing.
Well, that's just the beginning of the show.
The real show starts when the police appears.
What will they do? Arrest us? We are nowhere to be seen.
We are three blocks away observing it from our espresso bar.
Arrest the shoppers with kids? Doesn't make sense.
Of course, you could bet they have done the most stupid thing: They arrested the barrel. And now the picture of the smashed face on the barrel with the policeman dragging them to the police car, that was the best day for the photographers from newspapers that they ever will have.
So, I mean, these are the things you can do, and you can always use the humor.
There is also one big thing about the humor: It really hurts, because these guys really are taking themselves too seriously.
When you start to mock them, it hurts.
Now, everybody is talking about His Majesty, the Internet, and it is also a very useful skill, but don't rush to label things like Facebook Revolution, Twitter Revolution.
Don't mix tools with the substance.
It is true that the Internet and new media are very useful in making things faster and cheaper.
They make it also a bit safer for the participants because they give the part of anonymity.
We are watching the great example of something else the Internet can do.
It can put the price tag of state-sponsored violence over nonviolent protesters.
This is a famous group, We are all Khaled Said, made by Wael Ghonim in Egypt and his friend.
This is the mutilated face of the guy who was beaten by the police.
This is how he became the public, and this is what probably became the straw which broke the camel's back.
But here is also the bad news.
The nonviolent struggle is won in the real world, in the streets. You will never change your society towards democracy or economics if you sit down and click.
There are risks to be taken and there are living people who are winning the struggle.
Well, million dollar question: What will happen in the Arab World?
And though young people from the Arab World were pretty successful in bringing down three dictators, shaking the region, kind of persuading clever kings from Jordan and Morocco doing substantial reforms, it is yet to be seen what will be the outcome, whether the Egyptians and Tunisians will make it through the transition or this will end in bloody ethnic and religious conflict, whether the Syrians will maintain nonviolent discipline, faced with the brutal daily violence which kills thousands already, or they will slip into violent struggle and make ugly civil war.
Will these revolutions be whole like through the transitions to democracy or be overtaken by military or extremists of all kinds? We cannot tell.
Same works for the Western sector, where you can see all of these excited young people protesting around the world, occupying this, occupying that.
Are they going to become the world wave?
Are they going to find their skills, their enthusiasm, and their strategy to find what they really want and push for the reform, or will they just stay complaining about the endless list of the things they hate?
This is the difference between two towns.
Now, what [do] the statistics have?
My friend's book, Maria Stephan's book, talks a lot about violent and nonviolent struggle, and there are some shocking data.
If you look at the last 35 years and different social transitions from dictatorship to democracy, you will see that out of 67 different cases, in 50 of these cases it was nonviolent struggle which was the key power.
This is one more reason to look at this phenomenon.
This is one more reason to look at the Generation Epsilon, enough for me to give them credit and hope that they will find their skills and their courage to use the nonviolent struggle and thus fix at least a part of the mess our generation is making in this world.
Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_listening_to_shame.html</url>
I'm going to tell you a little bit about my TEDxHouston Talk.
I woke up the morning after I gave that Talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life.
And I actually didn't leave my house for about three days.
The first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch.
And when I walked in, she was already at the table.
And I sat down, and she said, "God, you look like hell."
I said, "Thanks. I feel really -- I'm not functioning."
And she said, "What's going on?"
And I said, "I just told 500 people that I became a researcher to avoid vulnerability.
And that when being vulnerable emerged from my data, as absolutely essential to whole-hearted living, I told these 500 people that I had a breakdown.
I had a slide that said Breakdown.
At what point did I think that was a good idea?"
And she said, "I saw your Talk live-streamed.
It was not really you.
It was a little different than what you usually do.
But it was great."
And I said, "This can't happen.
YouTube, they're putting this thing on YouTube.
And we're going to be talking about 600, 700 people."
And she said, "Well, I think it's too late."
And I said, "Let me ask you something."
And she said, "Yeah."
And I said, "Do you remember when we were in college and really wild and kind of dumb?"
And she said, "Yeah."
And I said, "Remember when we'd leave a really bad message on our ex-boyfriend's answering machine?
Then we'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape?"
And she goes, "Uh ... no."
So of course, the only thing I could think of to say at that point was, "Yeah, me neither.
That ... me neither."
And I'm thinking to myself, "Brene, what are you doing? What are you doing?
Why did you bring this up? Have you lost your mind?
Your sisters would be perfect for this."
So I looked back up and she said, "Are you really going to try to break in and steal the video before they put it on YouTube?"
And I said, "I'm just thinking about it a little bit."
She said, "You're like the worst vulnerability role model ever."
And then I looked at her and I said something that at the time felt a little dramatic, but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic.
I said, "If 500 turns into 1,000 or 2,000, my life is over."
I had no contingency plan for four million.
And my life did end when that happened.
And maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that I learned something hard about myself, and that was that, as much as I would frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world, there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small, staying right under the radar.
But I want to talk about what I've learned.
There's two things that I've learned in the last year.
The first is vulnerability is not weakness.
And that myth is profoundly dangerous.
Let me ask you honestly -- and I'll give you this warning, I'm trained as a therapist, so I can out-wait you uncomfortably -- so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome -- how many of you honestly, when you're thinking about doing something vulnerable or saying something vulnerable, think, "God, vulnerability's weakness. This is weakness?"
How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously?
The majority of people.
Now let me ask you this question: This past week at TED, how many of you, when you saw vulnerability up here, thought it was pure courage?
Vulnerability is not weakness.
I define vulnerability as emotional risk, exposure, uncertainty.
It fuels our daily lives.
And I've come to the belief -- this is my 12th year doing this research -- that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage -- to be vulnerable, to let ourselves be seen, to be honest.
One of the weird things that's happened is, after the TED explosion, I got a lot of offers to speak all over the country -- everyone from schools and parent meetings to Fortune 500 companies.
And so many of the calls went like this, "Hey, Dr. Brown. We loved your TEDTalk.
We'd like you to come in and speak.
We'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention vulnerability or shame."
What would you like for me to talk about?
There's three big answers.
This is mostly, to be honest with you, from the business sector: innovation, creativity and change.
So let me go on the record and say, vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change.
To create is to make something that has never existed before.
There's nothing more vulnerable than that.
Adaptability to change is all about vulnerability.
The second thing, in addition to really finally understanding the relationship between vulnerability and courage, the second thing I learned is this: We have to talk about shame.
And I'm going to be really honest with you.
When I became a "vulnerability researcher" and that became the focus because of the TEDTalk -- and I'm not kidding.
I'll give you an example.
About three months ago, I was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store.
About from a hundred feet away, this is what I hear: "Vulnerability TED! Vulnerability TED!"
I'm a fifth generation Texan.
Our family motto is "Lock and load."
I am not a natural vulnerability researcher.
So I'm like, just keep walking, she's on my six.
And then I hear, "Vulnerability TED!"
I turn around, I go, "Hi."
She's right here and she said, "You're the shame researcher who had the breakdown."
At this point parents are, like, pulling their children close.
"Look away."
And I'm so worn out at this point in my life, I look at her and I actually say, "It was a frickin' spiritual awakening."
And she looks back and does this, "I know."
And she said, "We watched your TEDTalk in my book club.
Then we read your book and we renamed ourselves 'The Breakdown Babes.'" And she said, "Our tagline is: 'We're falling apart and it feels fantastic.'" You can only imagine what it's like for me in a faculty meeting.
So when I became Vulnerability TED, like an action figure -- like Ninja Barbie, but I'm Vulnerability TED -- I thought, I'm going to leave that shame stuff behind, because I spent six years studying shame before I really started writing and talking about vulnerability.
And I thought, thank God, because shame is this horrible topic, no one wants to talk about it.
It's the best way to shut people down on an airplane.
"What do you do?" "I study shame." "Oh."
And I see you.
But in surviving this last year, I was reminded of a cardinal rule -- not a research rule, but a moral imperative from my upbringing -- you've got to dance with the one who brung ya.
And I did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability.
I learned about these things from studying shame.
And so I want to walk you in to shame.
Jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul.
And we're going to walk in.
And the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there.
It is to put on some galoshes and walk through and find our way around.
Here's why.
We heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country, and I think globally, around race, right?
Yes? We heard that.
Yes?
Cannot have that conversation without shame, because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege.
And when people start talking about privilege, they get paralyzed by shame.
We heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery, which is have a checklist.
You can't fix that problem without addressing shame, because when they teach those folks how to suture, they also teach them how to stitch their self-worth to being all-powerful.
And all-powerful folks don't need checklists.
And I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow so I didn't mess it up here.
Myshkin Ingawale, I hope I did right by you.
I saw the TED Fellows my first day here.
And he got up and he explained how he was driven to create some technology to help test for anemia because people were dying unnecessarily.
And he said, "I saw this need.
So you know what I did? I made it."
And everybody just burst into applause, and they were like "Yes!"
And he said, "And it didn't work.
And then I made it 32 more times, and then it worked."
You know what the big secret about TED is?
I can't wait to tell people this.
I guess I'm doing it right now.
This is like the failure conference.
No, it is.
You know why this place is amazing?
Because very few people here are afraid to fail.
And no one who gets on the stage, so far that I've seen, has not failed.
I've failed miserably, many times.
I don't think the world understands that because of shame.
There's a great quote that saved me this past year by Theodore Roosevelt.
A lot of people refer to it as the "Man in the Arena" quote.
And it goes like this: "It is not the critic who counts.
It is not the man who sits and points out how the doer of deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles.
The credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat.
But when he's in the arena, at best he wins, and at worst he loses, but when he fails, when he loses, he does so daring greatly."
And that's what this conference, to me, is about.
That's what life is about, about daring greatly, about being in the arena.
When you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door, and you think, "I'm going in and I'm going to try this," shame is the gremlin who says, "Uh, uh.
You're not good enough.
You never finished that MBA. Your wife left you.
I know your dad really wasn't in Luxembourg, he was in Sing Sing.
I know those things that happened to you growing up.
I know you don't think that you're pretty enough or smart enough or talented enough or powerful enough.
I know your dad never paid attention, even when you made CFO."
Shame is that thing.
And if we can quiet it down and walk in and say, "I'm going to do this," we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing, 99 percent of the time is who?
Us.
Shame drives two big tapes -- "never good enough" and, if you can talk it out of that one, "who do you think you are?"
The thing to understand about shame is it's not guilt.
Shame is a focus on self, guilt is a focus on behavior.
Shame is "I am bad."
Guilt is "I did something bad."
How many of you, if you did something that was hurtful to me, would be willing to say, "I'm sorry. I made a mistake?"
How many of you would be willing to say that?
Guilt: I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
Shame: I'm sorry. I am a mistake.
There's a huge difference between shame and guilt.
And here's what you need to know.
Shame is highly, highly correlated with addiction, depression, violence, aggression, bullying, suicide, eating disorders.
And here's what you even need to know more.
Guilt, inversely correlated with those things.
The ability to hold something we've done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive.
It's uncomfortable, but it's adaptive.
The other thing you need to know about shame is it's absolutely organized by gender.
If shame washes over me and washes over Chris, it's going to feel the same.
Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame.
We're pretty sure that the only people who don't experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy.
Which means, yes, I have a little shame; no, I'm a sociopath.
So I would opt for, yes, you have a little shame.
Shame feels the same for men and women, but it's organized by gender.
For women, the best example I can give you is Enjoli the commercial: "I can put the wash on the line, pack the lunches, hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine.
I can bring home the bacon, fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you're a man."
For women, shame is do it all, do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat.
I don't know how much perfume that commercial sold, but I guarantee you, it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds.
Shame, for women, is this web of unobtainable, conflicting, competing expectations about who we're supposed to be.
And it's a straight-jacket.
For men, shame is not a bunch of competing, conflicting expectations.
Shame is one, do not be perceived as what?
Weak.
I did not interview men for the first four years of my study.
And it wasn't until a man looked at me one day after a book signing, said, "I love what you have to say about shame, I'm curious why you didn't mention men."
And I said, "I don't study men."
And he said, "That's convenient."
And I said, "Why?"
And he said, "Because you say to reach out, tell our story, be vulnerable.
But you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters?"
I said, "Yeah."
"They'd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down.
When we reach out and be vulnerable we get the shit beat out of us.
And don't tell me it's from the guys and the coaches and the dads, because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else."
So I started interviewing men and asking questions.
And what I learned is this: You show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear, I'll show you a woman who's done incredible work.
You show me a man who can sit with a woman who's just had it, she can't do it all anymore, and his first response is not, "I unloaded the dishwasher," but he really listens -- because that's all we need -- I'll show you a guy who's done a lot of work.
Shame is an epidemic in our culture.
And to get out from underneath it, to find our way back to each other, we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we're parenting, the way we're working, the way we're looking at each other.
Very quickly, some research by Mahalik at Boston College.
He asked, what do women need to do to conform to female norms?
The top answers in this country: nice, thin, modest and use all available resources for appearance.
When he asked about men, what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms, the answers were: always show emotional control, work is first, pursue status and violence.
If we're going to find our way back to each other, we have to understand and know empathy, because empathy's the antidote to shame.
If you put shame in a Petri dish, it needs three things to grow exponentially: secrecy, silence and judgment.
If you put the same amount of shame in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy, it can't survive.
The two most powerful words when we're in struggle: me too.
And so I'll leave you with this thought.
If we're going to find our way back to each other, vulnerability is going to be that path.
And I know it's seductive to stand outside the arena, because I think I did it my whole life, and think to myself, I'm going to go in there and kick some ass when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect.
And that is seductive.
But the truth is that never happens.
And even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster when you got in there, that's not what we want to see.
We want you to go in.
We want to be with you and across from you.
And we just want, for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with, to dare greatly.
So thank you all very much. I really appreciate it.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/a_robot_that_flies_like_a_bird.html</url>
It is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird.
Birds are very agile.
They fly, not with rotating components, so they fly only by flapping their wings.
So we looked at the birds, and we tried to make a model that is powerful, ultralight, and it must have excellent aerodynamic qualities that would fly by its own and only by flapping its wings.
So what would be better [than] to use the Herring Gull, in its freedom, circling and swooping over the sea, and [to] use this as a role model?
So we bring a team together.
There are generalists and also specialists in the field of aerodynamics in the field of building gliders.
And the task was to build an ultralight indoor-flying model that is able to fly over your heads.
So be careful later on.
And this was one issue: to build it that lightweight that no one would be hurt if it fell down.
So why do we do all this?
We are a company in the field of automation, and we'd like to do very lightweight structures because that's energy efficient, and we'd like to learn more about pneumatics and air flow phenomena.
So I now would like you to [put] your seat belts on and put your hats [on].
So maybe we'll try it once -- to fly a SmartBird.
Thank you.
So we can now look at the SmartBird.
So here is one without a skin.
We have a wingspan of about two meters.
The length is one meter and six, and the weight, it is only 450 grams.
And it is all out of carbon fiber.
In the middle we have a motor, and we also have a gear in it, and we use the gear to transfer the circulation of the motor.
So within the motor, we have three Hall sensors, so we know exactly where the wing is.
And if we now beat up and down ...
we have the possibility to fly like a bird.
So if you go down, you have the large area of propulsion, and if you go up, the wings are not that large, and it is easier to get up.
So, the next thing we did, or the challenges we did, was to coordinate this movement.
We have to turn it, go up and go down.
We have a split wing.
With a split wing we get the lift at the upper wing, and we get the propulsion at the lower wing.
Also, we see how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency.
We had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency and then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency.
So therefore, it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion, from 30 percent up to 80 percent.
Next thing we have to do, we have to control and regulate the whole structure.
Only if you control and regulate it, you will get that aerodynamic efficiency.
So the overall consumption of energy is about 25 watts at takeoff and 16 to 18 watts in flight.
Thank you.
Markus, I think that we should fly it once more.
Markus Fischer: Yeah, sure.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/thulasiraj_ravilla_how_low_cost_eye_care_can_be_world_class.html</url>
Good morning.
I've come here to share with you an experiment of how to get rid of one form of human suffering.
It really is a story of Dr. Venkataswamy.
His mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System.
I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind.
Everywhere I went looking for work, they said no, what use do we have for a blind woman?
I couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair.
If an ant fell into my rice, I couldn't see that either.
Thulasiraj Ravilla: Becoming blind is a big part of it, but I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood, their dignity, their independence, and their status in the family.
So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind.
And the irony is that they don't need to be.
A simple, well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions, and something even simpler, a pair of glasses, can make millions more see.
If we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses, then almost one in five Indians will require eye care, a staggering 200 million people.
Today, we're reaching not even 10 percent of them.
So this is the context in which Aravind came into existence about 30 years back as a post-retirement project of Dr. V.
He started this with no money.
He had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan.
And over time, we have grown into a network of five hospitals, predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, and then we added several, what we call Vision Centers as a hub-and-spoke model.
And then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well.
The last three decades, we have done about three-and-a-half million surgeries, a vast majority of them for the poor people.
Now, each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries.
A typical day at Aravind, we would do about a thousand surgeries, maybe see about 6,000 patients, send out teams into the villages to examine, bring back patients, lots of telemedicine consultations, and, on top of that, do a lot of training, both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind.
And then doing this day-in and day-out, and doing it well, requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work.
And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks put in place by Dr. V., a value system, an efficient delivery process, and fostering the culture of innovation.
Dr. V: I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village, and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being, you seem to be one with him.
Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence.
Doctor, whatever you say, I accept it.
An implicit faith in you and then you respond to it.
Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me, I must do my best for her.
When we grow in spiritual consciousness, we identify ourselves with all that is in the world, so there is no exploitation.
It is ourselves we are helping.
It is ourselves we are healing.
This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization and systems that support it.
But on a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently, and, odd as it may seem, the inspiration came from McDonald's.
Dr. V: See, McDonald's' concept is simple.
They feel they can train people all over the world, irrespective of different religions, cultures, all those things, to produce a product in the same way and deliver it in the same manner in hundreds of places.
Larry Brilliant: He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers, and none of it made any sense to us.
He wanted to create a franchise, a mechanism of delivery of eye care with the efficiency of McDonald's.
Dr. V: Supposing I'm able to produce eye care, techniques, methods, all in the same way, and make it available in every corner of the world.
The problem of blindness is gone.
If you think about it, I think the eyeball is the same, as American or African, the problem is the same, the treatment is the same.
And yet, why should there be so much variation in quality and in service, and that was the fundamental principle that we followed when we designed the delivery systems.
And, of course, the challenge was that it's a huge problem, we are talking of millions of people, very little resource to deal with it, and then lots of logistics and affordability issues.
And then so, one had to constantly innovate.
And one of the early innovations, which still continues, is to create ownership in the community to the problem, and then engage with them as a partner, and here is one such event.
Here a community camp just organized by the community themselves, where they find a place, organize volunteers, and then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision, and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done, and then those tests are done by technicians who check for glasses, or check for glaucoma.
And then, with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis, and then prescribes a line of treatment, and if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site, usually under a tree.
But they get glasses in the frames of their choice, and that's very important because I think glasses, in addition to helping people see, is also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it.
So they get it in about 20 minutes and those who require surgery, are counseled, and then there are buses waiting, which will transport them to the base hospital.
And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support, many people like this would probably never get services, and certainly not when they most need it.
They receive surgery the following day, and then they will stay for a day or two, and then they are put back on the buses to be taken back to where they came from, and where their families will be waiting to take them back home.
And this happens several thousand times each year.
It may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients, very efficient process, but we looked at, are we solving the problem?
We did a study, a scientifically designed process, and then, to our dismay, we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need, and we're not adequately addressing more, bigger problems.
So we had to do something different, so we set up what we call primary eye care centers, vision centers.
These are truly paperless offices with completely electronic medical records and so on.
They receive comprehensive eye exams.
We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera, and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor.
The effect of this has been that, within the first year, we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served, which is over 50,000 people.
And the second year went up to 75 percent.
So I think we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach everyone who needs it, and in this process of using technology, make sure that most don't need to come to the base hospital.
And how much will they pay for this?
We fixed the pricing, taking into account what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city, so they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations.
The other challenge was, how do you give high-tech or more advanced treatment and care?
We designed a van with a VSAT, which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is diagnosed, and then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient, it gets printed out, the patient gets it, and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing -- I mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months, and then this happens as a way of bridging the technology competence.
So the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market, because it focused on the non-customer, and then by reaching the unreached, we're able to significantly grow the market.
The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists?
So what is in this video is a surgeon operating, and then you see on the other side, another patient is getting ready.
So, as they finish the surgery, they just swing the microscope over, the tables are placed so that their distance is just right, we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon.
And then to support the surgeon, we require a certain workforce.
And then we focused on village girls that we recruited, and then they really are the backbone of the organization.
They do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks.
They do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well.
With the result we have very high productivity, very high quality at very, very low cost.
So, putting all this together, what really happened was the productivity of our staff was significantly higher than anyone else.
This is a very busy table, but what this really is conveying is that, when it comes to quality, we have put in very good quality-assurance systems.
As a result, our complications are significantly lower than what has been reported in the United Kingdom, and you don't see those kind of numbers very often.
So the final part of the puzzle is, how do you make all this work financially, especially when the people can't pay for it?
So what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free, and then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates, nothing more, and often much less.
And we were helped by the market inefficiency.
I think that has been a big savior, even now.
And, of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus.
The result has been, over the years, the expenditure has increased with volumes.
The revenues increase at a higher level, giving us a healthy margin while you're treating a large number of people for free.
I think in absolute terms, last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars, spent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA.
But this really requires going beyond what we do, or what we have done, if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness.
And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things.
We created competition for ourselves, and then we made eye care affordable by making low-cost consumables.
We proactively and systematically promoted these practices to many hospitals in India, many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well.
The impact of this has been that these hospitals, in the second year after our consultation, are double their output and then achieve financial recovery as well.
The other part was how do you address this increase in cost of technology?
There was a time when we failed to negotiate the [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels, so we set up a manufacturing unit.
And then, over time, we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out.
Today, we believe we have about seven percent of the global market, and they're used in about 120-odd countries.
To conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance, or is it just India or developing countries?
So to address this, we studied UK versus Aravind.
What it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent of the volume of what the UK does, near a half-million surgeries as a whole country.
And we do about 300,000.
And then we train about 50 ophthalmologists against the 70 trained by them, comparable quality, both in training and in patient care.
So we're really comparing apples to apples.
We looked at cost.
So, I think it is simple to say just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening.
I think there is more to it.
I mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well.
Maybe there is -- the solution to the cost could be in productivity, maybe in efficiency, in the clinical process, or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables, or regulations, their defensive practice.
So, I think decoding this can probably bring answers to most developed countries including the U.S., and maybe Obama's ratings can go up again.
Another insight, which, again, I want to leave with you, in conditions where the problem is very large, which cuts across all economic strata, where we have a good solution, I think the process I described, you know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care, can give an answer, and there are many which fit this paradigm.
You take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on.
There are many where this paradigm can now play, but I think probably one of the most challenging things is on the softer side.
Now, how do you create compassion?
Now, how do you make people own the problem, want to do something about it?
There are a bit harder issues.
And I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these.
So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you.
Dr. V: When you grow in spiritual consciousness, we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation.
It is ourselves we are helping.
It is ourselves we are healing.
Thank you very much.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/fabian_hemmert_the_shape_shifting_future_of_the_mobile_phone.html</url>
I am a Ph.D. student and that means I have a question: how can we make digital content graspable?
Because you see, on the one hand, there is the digital world and no question, many things are happening there right now.
And for us humans, it's not quite material, it's not really there -- it's virtual.
On the other hand, we humans, we live in a physical world.
It's rich, it tastes good, it feels good, it smells good.
So the question is: how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical?
That's my question.
If you look at the iPhone with its touch and the Wii with its bodily activity, you can see the tendency; it's getting physical.
The question is: what's next?
Now, I have three options that I would like to show you.
The first one is mass.
As humans, we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy.
So, could we use that in mobile phones?
Let me show you the weight-shifting mobile.
It is a mobile phone-shaped box that has an iron weight inside, which we can move around, and you can feel where it's heavy.
We shift the gravitational center of it.
For example, we can augment digital content with physical mass.
So you move around the content on a display, but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device.
Another thing it's good for is navigation -- it can guide you around in a city.
It can tell you by its weight, "Okay, move right. Walk ahead. Make a left here."
And the good thing about that is you don't have to look at the device all the time; you have your eyes free to see the city.
Now, mass is the first thing; the second thing, that's shape.
We're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in [our] hands.
So if I download an e-book and it has 20 pages -- well, they could be thin, right -- but if it has 500 pages, I want to feel that "Harry Potter" -- it's thick.
So let me show you the shape-changing mobile.
Again, it's a mobile phone-shaped box, and this one can change its shape.
We can play with the shape itself.
For example, it can be thin in your pocket, which we of course want it to be; but then if you hold it in your hand, it can lean towards you, be thick.
It's like tapered to the downside.
If you change the grasp, it can adjust to that.
It's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock, it stands.
It's fairly simple.
Another thing is, sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone, they are bigger than the phone itself.
So in that case -- like here, there's an app that's bigger than the phone's screen -- the shape of the phone could tell you, "Okay, off the screen right here, there is more content.
You can't see it, but it's there."
And you can feel that because it's thicker at that edge.
The shape is the second thing.
The third thing operates on a different level.
As humans, we are social, we are empathic, and that's great.
Wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive?
Think of a hamster in the pocket.
Well, I can feel it, it's doing all right -- I don't have to check it.
Let me show you the living mobile phone.
So, once again, mobile phone-shaped box, but this one, it has a breath and a heartbeat, and it feels very organic.
And you can tell, it's relaxed right now.
Oh now, missed call, a new call, new girlfriend maybe -- very exciting.
How do we calm it down?
You give it a pat behind the ears, and everything is all right again.
So, that's very intuitive, and that's what we want.
So, what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us.
And I think making it physical is a good way to do that.
What's behind that is a postulation, namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future; rather than that, technology, a bit more human.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/sue_austin_deep_sea_diving_in_a_wheelchair.html</url>
It's wonderful to be here to talk about my journey, to talk about the wheelchair and the freedom it has bought me.
I started using a wheelchair 16 years ago when an extended illness changed the way I could access the world.
When I started using the wheelchair, it was a tremendous new freedom.
I'd seen my life slip away and become restricted.
It was like having an enormous new toy.
I could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again.
Just being out on the street was exhilarating.
But even though I had this newfound joy and freedom, people's reaction completely changed towards me.
It was as if they couldn't see me anymore, as if an invisibility cloak had descended.
They seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions of what it must be like to be in a wheelchair.
When I asked people their associations with the wheelchair, they used words like "limitation," "fear," "pity" and "restriction."
I realized I'd internalized these responses and it had changed who I was on a core level.
A part of me had become alienated from myself.
I was seeing myself not from my perspective, but vividly and continuously from the perspective of other people's responses to me.
As a result, I knew I needed to make my own stories about this experience, new narratives to reclaim my identity.
["Finding Freedom: 'By creating our own stories we learn to take the texts of our lives as seriously as we do 'official' narratives.' — Davis 2009, TEDx Women"] I started making work that aimed to communicate something of the joy and freedom I felt when using a wheelchair -- a power chair -- to negotiate the world.
I was working to transform these internalized responses, to transform the preconceptions that had so shaped my identity when I started using a wheelchair, by creating unexpected images.
The wheelchair became an object to paint and play with.
When I literally started leaving traces of my joy and freedom, it was exciting to see the interested and surprised responses from people.
It seemed to open up new perspectives, and therein lay the paradigm shift.
It showed that an arts practice can remake one's identity and transform preconceptions by revisioning the familiar.
So when I began to dive, in 2005, I realized scuba gear extends your range of activity in just the same way as a wheelchair does, but the associations attached to scuba gear are ones of excitement and adventure, completely different to people's responses to the wheelchair.
So I thought, "I wonder what'll happen if I put the two together?"
And the underwater wheelchair that has resulted has taken me on the most amazing journey over the last seven years.
So to give you an idea of what that's like, I'd like to share with you one of the outcomes from creating this spectacle, and show you what an amazing journey it's taken me on.
It is the most amazing experience, beyond most other things I've experienced in life.
I literally have the freedom to move in 360 degrees of space and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom.
And the incredibly unexpected thing is that other people seem to see and feel that too.
Their eyes literally light up, and they say things like, "I want one of those," or, "If you can do that, I can do anything."
And I'm thinking, it's because in that moment of them seeing an object they have no frame of reference for, or so transcends the frames of reference they have with the wheelchair, they have to think in a completely new way.
And I think that moment of completely new thought perhaps creates a freedom that spreads to the rest of other people's lives.
For me, this means that they're seeing the value of difference, the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limitation, we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives.
For me, the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation.
In fact, I now call the underwater wheelchair "Portal," because it's literally pushed me through into a new way of being, into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness.
And the other thing is, that because nobody's seen or heard of an underwater wheelchair before, and creating this spectacle is about creating new ways of seeing, being and knowing, now you have this concept in your mind.
You're all part of the artwork too.

<title>Sue Austin: Deep sea diving ... in a wheelchair</title>
<description>When Sue Austin got a power chair 16 years ago, she felt a tremendous sense of freedom -- yet others looked at her as though she had lost something. In her art, she aims to convey the spirit of wonder she feels wheeling through the world. Includes thrilling footage of an underwater wheelchair that lets her explore ocean beds, drifting through schools of fish, floating free in 360 degrees. </description>

I just did something I've never done before.
I spent a week at sea on a research vessel.
Now I'm not a scientist, but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team from the University of South Florida who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil This is the boat we were on, by the way.
The scientists I was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff -- the birds, the turtles, the dolphins, the glamorous stuff.
They're looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff.
And what they're finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton, which is very bad news, because so much life depends on it.
So contrary to what we heard a few months back about how 75 percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we didn't have to worry about it, this disaster is still unfolding.
It's still working its way up the food chain.
Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us.
Rachel Carson -- the godmother of modern environmentalism -- warned us about this very thing back in 1962.
She pointed out that the "control men" -- as she called them -- who carpet-bombed towns and fields with toxic insecticides like DDT, were only trying to kill the little stuff, the insects, not the birds.
But they forgot this: the fact that birds dine on grubs, that robins eat lots of worms now saturated with DDT.
And so, robin eggs failed to hatch, songbirds died en masse, towns fell silent.
Thus the title "Silent Spring."
I've been trying to pinpoint what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico, because I'm Canadian, and I can draw no ancestral ties.
And I think what it is is I don't think we have fully come to terms with the meaning of this disaster, with what it meant to witness a hole ripped in our world, with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth gush forth on live TV, 24 hours a day, for months.
After telling ourselves for so long that our tools and technology can control nature, suddenly we were face-to-face with our weakness, with our lack of control, as the oil burst out of every attempt to contain it -- "top hats," "top kills" and, most memorably, the "junk shot" -- the bright idea of firing old tires and golf balls down that hole in the world.
But even more striking than the ferocious power emanating from that well was the recklessness with which that power was unleashed -- the carelessness, the lack of planning that characterized the operation from drilling to clean-up.
If there is one thing BP's watery improv act made clear, it is that, as a culture, we have become far too willing to gamble with things that are precious and irreplaceable, and to do so without a back-up plan, without an exit strategy.
And BP was hardly our first experience of this in recent years.
Our leaders barrel into wars, telling themselves happy stories about cakewalks and welcome parades.
Then, it is years of deadly damage control, Frankensteins of sieges and surges and counter-insurgencies, and once again, no exit strategy.
Our financial wizards routinely fall victim to similar overconfidence, convincing themselves that the latest bubble is a new kind of market -- the kind that never goes down.
And when it inevitably does, the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot -- in this case, throwing massive amounts of much-needed public money down a very different kind of hole.
As with BP, the hole does get plugged, at least temporarily, but not before exacting a tremendous price.
We have to figure out why we keep letting this happen, because we are in the midst of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all -- deciding what to do, or not to do, about climate change.
Now as you know, a great deal of time is spent, inside the climate debate, on the question of, "What if the IPC scientists are all wrong?"
Now a far more relevant question -- as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it -- is, "What if those scientists are right?"
Given the stakes, the climate crisis clearly calls for us to act based on the precautionary principle -- the theory that holds that when human health and the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential damage is irreversible, we cannot afford to wait for perfect scientific certainty.
Better to err on the side of caution.
More overt, the burden of proving that a practice is safe should not be placed on the public that would be harmed, but rather on the industry that stands to profit.
But climate policy in the wealthy world -- to the extent that such a thing exists -- is not based on precaution, but rather on cost-benefit analysis -- finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our GDP.
So rather than asking, as precaution would demand, what can we do as quickly as possible to avoid potential catastrophe, we ask bizarre questions like this: "What is the latest possible moment we can wait before we begin seriously lowering emissions?
Can we put this off till 2020, 2030, 2050?"
Or we ask, "How much hotter can we let the planet get and still survive?
Can we go with two degrees, three degrees, or -- where we're currently going -- four degrees Celsius?"
And by the way, the assumption that we can safely control the Earth's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat, making the planet not too hot, not too cold, but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style -- this is pure fantasy, and it's not coming from the climate scientists.
It's coming from the economists imposing their mechanistic thinking on the science.
The fact is that we simply don't know when the warming that we create will be utterly overwhelmed by feedback loops.
So once again, why do we take these crazy risks with the precious?
A range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now, like "greed."
This is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it, because taking big risks, as we all know, pays a lot of money.
Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness is hubris.
And greed and hubris are intimately intertwined when it comes to recklessness.
For instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker taking home 100 times more than a brain surgeon, then you need a narrative, you need a story that makes that disparity okay.
And you actually don't have a lot of options.
You're either an incredibly good scammer, and you're getting away with it -- you gamed the system -- or you're some kind of boy genius, the likes of which the world has never seen.
Now both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer -- and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future.
By the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP, had a plaque on his desk inscribed with this inspirational slogan: "What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?"
Now this is actually a popular plaque, and this is a crowd of overachievers, so I'm betting that some of you have this plaque.
Don't feel ashamed.
Putting fear of failure out of your mind can be a very good thing if you're training for a triathlon or preparing to give a TEDTalk, but personally, I think people with the power to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology would do better having a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall, because -- maybe not that one in particular -- but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure all of the time.
So we have greed, we've got overconfidence/hubris, but since we're here at TEDWomen, let's consider one other factor that could be contributing in some small way to societal recklessness.
Now I'm not going to belabor this point, but studies do show that, as investors, women are much less prone to taking reckless risks than men, precisely because, as we've already heard, women tend not to suffer from overconfidence in the same way that men do.
So it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides -- for society at least.
The flipside of this is that constantly being told that you are gifted, chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides.
And this problem -- call it the "perils of privilege" -- brings us closer, I think, to the root of our collective recklessness.
Because none of us -- at least in the global North -- neither men nor women, are fully exempt from this message.
Here's what I'm talking about.
Whether we actively believe them or consciously reject them, our culture remains in the grips of certain archetypal stories about our supremacy over others and over nature -- the narrative of the newly discovered frontier and the conquering pioneer, the narrative of manifest destiny, the narrative of apocalypse and salvation.
And just when you think these stories are fading into history, and that we've gotten over them, they pop up in the strangest places.
For instance, I stumbled across this advertisement outside the women's washroom in the Kansas City airport.
It's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone, and yes, it really does say, "Slap Mother Nature in the face."
And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola -- that's just a bonus.
I'm showing it because -- they're not a sponsor, are they? -- because, in its own way, this is a crass version of our founding story.
We slapped Mother Nature around and won, and we always win, because dominating nature is our destiny.
But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature.
There's another one, equally important, about how that very same Mother Nature is so nurturing and so resilient that we can never make a dent in her abundance.
Let's hear from Tony Hayward again.
"The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean.
The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume."
In other words, the ocean is big; she can take it.
It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do.
Because this is our real master-narrative: however much we mess up, there will always be more -- more water, more land, more untapped resources.
A new bubble will replace the old one.
A new technology will come along to fix the messes we made with the last one.
In a way, that is the story of the settling of the Americas, the supposedly inexhaustible frontier to which Europeans escaped.
And it's also the story of modern capitalism, because it was the wealth from this land that gave birth to our economic system, one that cannot survive without perpetual growth and an unending supply of new frontiers.
Now the problem is that the story was always a lie.
The Earth always did have limits.
They were just beyond our sights.
And now we are hitting those limits on multiple fronts.
I believe that we know this, yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop.
Not only do we continue to tell and retell the same tired stories, but we are now doing so with a frenzy and a fury that, frankly, verges on camp.
How else to explain the cultural space occupied by Sarah Palin?
Now on the one hand, exhorting us to "drill, baby, drill," because God put those resources into the ground in order for us to exploit them, and on the other, glorying in the wilderness of Alaska's untouched beauty on her hit reality TV show.
The twin message is as comforting as it is mad.
Ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall.
There are still no limits.
There will always be another frontier.
So stop worrying and keep shopping.
Now, would that this were just about Sarah Palin and her reality TV show.
In environmental circles, we often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables, we are continuing with business as usual.
This assessment, unfortunately, is far too optimistic.
The truth is that we have already exhausted so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels that we have already entered a far riskier business era, the era of extreme energy.
So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water, including the icy Arctic seas, where a clean-up may simply be impossible.
It means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip-mining operations for coal, the likes of which we haven't yet seen.
And most controversially, it means the tar sands.
I'm always surprised by how little people outside of Canada know about the Alberta Tar Sands, which this year are projected to become the number one source of imported oil to the United States.
It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice, because I believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we're on like little else.
So this is where the tar sands live, under one of the last magnificent Boreal forests.
The oil is not liquid.
You can't just drill a hole and pump it out.
Tar sand's oil is solid, mixed in with the soil.
So to get at it, you first have to get rid of the trees.
Then, you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand.
The process requires a huge amount of water, which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds.
That's very bad news for local indigenous people living downstream who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates.
Now looking at these images, it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation, which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of England.
I find it helps actually to look at the dump trucks that move the earth, the largest ever built.
That's a person down there by the wheel.
My point is that this is not oil drilling.
It's not even mining.
It is terrestrial skinning.
Vast, vivid landscapes are being gutted, left monochromatic gray.
Now I should confess that as [far as] I'm concerned this would be an abomination if it emitted not one particle of carbon.
But the truth is that, on average, turning that gunk into crude oil produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution than it does to produce conventional oil in Canada.
How else to describe this, but as a form of mass insanity?
Just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet, off the power of sun, wind and waves, we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest, highest-emitting stuff imaginable.
This is where our story of endless growth has taken us, to this black hole at the center of my country -- a place of such planetary pain that, like the BP gusher, one can only stand to look at it for so long.
As Jared Diamond and others have shown us, this is how civilizations commit suicide, by slamming their foot on the accelerator at the exact moment when they should be putting on the brakes.
The problem is that our master-narrative has an answer for that too.
At the very last minute, we are going to get saved just like in every Hollywood movie, just like in the Rapture.
But, of course, our secular religion is technology.
Now, you may have noticed more and more headlines like these.
The idea behind this form of "geoengineering" as it's called, is that, as the planet heats up, we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles into the stratosphere to reflect some of the sun's rays back to space, thereby cooling the planet.
The wackiest plan -- and I'm not making this up -- would put what is essentially a garden hose 18-and-a-half miles high into the sky, suspended by balloons, to spew sulfur dioxide.
So, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution.
Think of it as the ultimate junk shot.
The serious scientists involved in this research all stress that these techniques are entirely untested.
They don't know if they'll work, and they have no idea what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash.
Nevertheless, the mere mention of geoengineering is being greeted in some circles, particularly media circles, with a relief tinged with euphoria.
An escape hatch has been reached.
A new frontier has been found.
Most importantly, we don't have to change our lifestyles after all.
You see, for some people, their savior is a guy in a flowing robe.
For other people, it's a guy with a garden hose.
We badly need some new stories.
We need stories that have different kinds of heroes willing to take different kinds of risks -- risks that confront recklessness head on, that put the precautionary principle into practice, even if that means through direct action -- like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested, blocking dirty power plants or fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining.
We need stories that replace that linear narrative of endless growth with circular narratives that remind us that what goes around comes around.
That this is our only home.
There is no escape hatch.
Call it karma, call it physics, action and reaction, call it precaution -- the principle that reminds us that life is too precious to be risked for any profit.
Thank you.

<title>Naomi Klein: Addicted to risk</title>
<description>Days before this talk, journalist Naomi Klein was on a boat in the Gulf of Mexico, looking at the catastrophic results of BP's risky pursuit of oil. Our societies have become addicted to extreme risk in finding new energy, new financial instruments and more ... and too often, we're left to clean up a mess afterward. Klein's question: What's the backup plan?</description>

Dan Holzman: Please throw out the beanbag chairs. Here we go.
Barry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today, but this is really, I think, when it reached its peak as far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility ...
DH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show; it's something we just kind of learned for this, so we're going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs?
BF: Nice show, Daniel, nice show. You are the man!
Nice show. Man, that was good!
DH: Thank you.
BF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down.
You actually just did that.
That's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today ...
DH: All right, let's show them something special.
BF: ... without a MacArthur grant.
Yeah, look at this. You know, all kinds of different ...
TED is about invention, let's be honest. Right? DH: Yeah, it is.
BF: Last night, Michael Moschen showed some juggling props he has invented and working on.
Right now, Dan's going to show something he actually invented.
DH: A type of juggling I actually invented, right after I saw another juggler do it.
BF: Shut up.
DH: And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece.
Folks, this is shaker cup juggling. It's not a showstopper but it certainly slows it down.
BF: Oh yeah, it does.
BF: Oh, Daniel.
DH: One more?
Perfect.
Perfect.
BF: OK. DH: Oh! All right.
I'm now pushing my luck: I'm skipping right to six cups.
In order to do six cups, I must have perfect control over three with my right hand.
BF: Also three with his left.
DH: Perfect.
And now, all six cups. Should I do it on the first try or should I miss once on purpose?
BF: First try? Once on purpose?
DH: How about if I try first and then decide?
BF: Good idea. Let's leave that. We'll leave that door open.
DH: He's looking at me.
BF: That's all right, he does that. All right.
DH: Oh! It's time for Richard's help.
Oh, good. All right.
BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference, it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with Richard. And we've always done something with the bullwhips in our act. It's funny, for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons.
And then we thought, "How stupid."
DH: Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone?
BF: I think that's the next session.
DH: Next session?
BF: Yeah. And so we've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this.
He actually assumes more of the danger in this.
DH: Please stand up, Richard.
Oh, sorry.
DH: Now Richard, please ...
BF: OK, sorry.
DH: Jesus Christ. Richard, please stand in front of me.
Richard Wurman: Can I say something?
BF: Sure.
RW: In all past years I've rehearsed with them, the things that have happened to me -- I have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth.
DH: All right, please stand here in front ...
God, I hate that. Put your hands out like this, please.
BF: No, come stay up with him.
Dan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection.
It's kind of neat. OK.
DH: Wow, you've been working out.
BF: No, shut up!
Having a little bit of Richard time. That's nice, that's good.
OK, here we go.
Have him hold your wrist so I can ...
DH: Please hold my wrist, will you. BF: Yeah, hold this a minute.
There you go.
OK.
OK, hold on.
RW: Hmmm.
DH: First one.
BF: All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now, Richard.
DH: So Richard, what were we on the list? Like 1,020?
What happened there?
BF: I think we were just outside.
DH: I don't get it.
DH: Sorry. BF: Having some bad flashbacks.
RW: Do you want me to hold you or not? DH: Don't hold me that hard.
BF: Here we go, I'm taking it.
DH: One more, one more.
BF: We've got one more we're going to do.
RW: Do I get to hold them?
BF: You don't want to hold these, trust me.
DH: Could you spread your legs a little bit?
BF: Gloria, you want to do it? It's very cool.
One more try. Man, I don't want to get too close.
Could you just push that?
DH: Wow! Boy!
BF: That's cool. I always wanted to try that.
DH: Let's jump this way, though.
Now, we risked Richard's life, it's only fair we risk our own lives.
So to do that, I will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles.
And if that wasn't enough, and judging by your response, it's not ...
DH: Wow! BF: Hoping for a little more build.
DH: True. Barry ...
BF: I'm going to run up behind him.
DH: Leap over my shoulder.
BF: Up and over his shoulders.
DH: Grab the blades in mid-air, land right there in a pool of blood ...
Still juggling.
Impossible, you say?
BF: Incredible, you say?
DH: Why bother, you say?
BF: Here we go.
DH: Just do it juggler boys, you say?
BF: This guy, this guy invented air.
DH: I think so, that's right.
Even the pencil.
BF: He invented the pencil.
DH: All right, we'll do this trick, but please remember it took us over 10 years to perfect.
BF: Ten years to perfect, which you're about to see.
DH: It's not that difficult, we just don't like to practice that much.
BF: No, it's a hassle. Traveling too much.
Actually, we will take a second to prove -- this could be fake -- that the blades are indeed razor-sharp.
DH: Will someone please throw a small farm animal up onto the stage?
Or a virgin for a sacrifice?
BF: Anything?
DH: Where's Gloria?
BF: No, she's got ... farm animal.
DH: Do you have a small farm animal?
Just trying to play the odds. All right, here we go.
BF: Over the top, over the top.
DH: How you feeling, Barry? You feeling all right?
BF: Yeah, it's all right.
DH: Do you feel everything's OK? The atmosphere, the ...
BF: Yeah, a little sketchy.
DH: Everything up here's OK?
BF: Yeah.
DH: Then here we go.
BF: This one's a little ... Who's doing the lights? Could you point that a little more directly into my eyeballs? Is that possible? I can still see a little.
DH: And turn up the intensity; we're still pink in the middle.
We went too far.
BF: Yeah, it's too far. It's too much of a visual.
The design of the body is a whole different thing.
DH: Ready, Barry? BF: Over the top.
DH: May we have our jumping music please?
May we have it a bit louder?
BF: They're a good crew! Whoa!
DH: Whoa, sorry. All right.
BF: We're going on.
DH: All right, we'll try again.
BF: All right? Oh my gosh. Oh.
DH: All right, here we go. Sorry about that.
BF: I thought I had the hard part. OK.
DH: Whenever you're ready.
BF: There we go!
All right, get up! Come on and dance! DH: Dance, come on. BF: Come on and dance!
Somebody dance! Come on!
Wow, wow, OK, stop.
Weird, no one dances. We're two guys doing this.
I think that's uncomfortable for everyone.
DH: The French judge ...
BF: One more quick thing.
DH: The French judge gives it a 5.2.
BF: Well, you know ...
DH: There you go ... BF: Oh, yeah. Another one coming in.
DH: Tell them about our bio and stuff.
BF: Yeah. In our bio, some of you may have read that we've won two world juggling championships.
And believe it or not, you don't win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups.
We're going to show you right now an excerpt from a routine that we used to wipe out the other juggling team competition.
DH: That's right.
BF: Good.
DH: I know what you're thinking: other juggling teams must really suck.
BF: Juggling's got a bad rap.
DH: But wait, Barry, there's still one more club lying there by my foot.
And look, it has a twin!
BF: Shut up.
DH: There's still one more by my foot.
What do you want me to do with it?
BF: Richard you tell him, it's your last year.
DH: That's a pretty good setup, Richard.
BF: Yeah, it's a good setup. That's a big setup.
DH: You can't get any better than that. All right. What I will do: I will use my panther-like reflexes.
BF: Nice.
DH: I got that -- to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel.
BF: Nice.
DH: I touched it, Barry. That should be enough.
BF: It's progress, that's the thing.
DH: How about that? I'll do it again.
Oh wait, it's on your side, Barry.
And it's awfully windy over there.
BF: It is, it's weird. You wouldn't think it would affect half the stage, but it is. It's weird.
Watch this: what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot.
DH: Wow! What a great trick, Barry!
Oh, look how it lies there.
Oh, Barry, is there nothing you can't do?
You are my hero. You're my Jim Shea, Jr.
Too much Olympics.
BF: From my foot, I'll attempt to kick the seventh club. Here we go.
DH: Where, Barry? Where? Tell us, Barry.
[Unclear] eagerly awaits your next syllable. What will it be?
What gem of knowledge?
What pearl of wisdom?
Do you want to buy a vowel, Barry?
Is that your final answer?
BF: All right! You have to turn off the TV from time to time.
DH: I do, I do.
BF: From my foot, the kick up in the seven.
DH: We will juggle seven.
BF: From six to seven. DH: That's a world's record. BF: Really? DH: For us.
BF: Yes.
DH: Whenever you're ready there, big guy.
Put your tongue away, Barry.
BF: Oh, oh, whoa.
DH: Please, please stay seated. Stay seated. Thank you.
Because now, to make this twice as difficult, we'll juggle the seven clubs back ...
BF: Seven-club juggling.
DH: ... to back.
BF: Thank you, that's it.
BF: Thank you guys!
DH: Thank you very much!

<description>Illustrious jugglers the Raspyni Brothers show off their uncanny balance, agility, coordination and willingness to sacrifice . Now, if you'll just stand completely still...</description>
<keywords>collaboration,entertainment,humor,physics</keywords>
<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/john_graham_cumming_the_greatest_machine_that_never_was.html</url>
So the machine I'm going to talk you about is what I call the greatest machine that never was.
It was a machine that was never built, and yet, it will be built.
It was a machine that was designed long before anyone thought about computers.
If you know anything about the history of computers, you will know that in the '30s and the '40s, simple computers were created that started the computer revolution we have today, and you would be correct, except for you'd have the wrong century.
The first computer was really designed in the 1830s and 1840s, not the 1930s and 1940s.
It was designed, and parts of it were prototyped, and the bits of it that were built are here in South Kensington.
That machine was built by this guy, Charles Babbage.
Now, I have a great affinity for Charles Babbage because his hair is always completely unkempt like this in every single picture.
He was a very wealthy man, and a sort of, part of the aristocracy of Britain, and on a Saturday night in Marylebone, were you part of the intelligentsia of that period, you would have been invited round to his house for a soiree — and he invited everybody: kings, the Duke of Wellington, many, many famous people — and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines.
I really miss that era, you know, where you could go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer get demonstrated to you.
But Babbage, Babbage himself was born at the end of the 18th century, and was a fairly famous mathematician.
He held the post that Newton held at Cambridge, and that was recently held by Stephen Hawking.
He's less well known than either of them because he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices and never made any of them.
The reason he never made any of them, he's a classic nerd.
Every time he had a good idea, he'd think, "That's brilliant, I'm going to start building that one.
I'll spend a fortune on it. I've got a better idea.
I'm going to work on this one. And I'm going to do this one."
He did this until Sir Robert Peel, then Prime Minister, basically kicked him out of Number 10 Downing Street, and kicking him out, in those days, that meant saying, "I bid you good day, sir."
The thing he designed was this monstrosity here, the analytical engine. Now, just to give you an idea of this, this is a view from above.
Every one of these circles is a cog, a stack of cogs, and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive.
So as I go through this talk, I want you to imagine this gigantic machine. We heard those wonderful sounds of what this thing would have sounded like.
And I'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine — that's why it's computer architecture — and tell you about this machine, which is a computer.
So let's talk about the memory. The memory is very like the memory of a computer today, except it was all made out of metal, stacks and stacks of cogs, 30 cogs high.
Imagine a thing this high of cogs, hundreds and hundreds of them, and they've got numbers on them.
It's a decimal machine. Everything's done in decimal.
And he thought about using binary. The problem with using binary is that the machine would have been so tall, it would have been ridiculous. As it is, it's enormous.
So he's got memory.
The memory is this bit over here.
You see it all like this.
This monstrosity over here is the CPU, the chip, if you like.
Of course, it's this big.
Completely mechanical. This whole machine is mechanical.
This is a picture of a prototype for part of the CPU which is in the Science Museum.
The CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic -- so addition, multiplication, subtraction, division -- which already is a bit of a feat in metal, but it could also do something that a computer does and a calculator doesn't: this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision.
It could do the "if then" for basic programmers, and that fundamentally made it into a computer.
It could compute. It couldn't just calculate. It could do more.
Now, if we look at this, and we stop for a minute, and we think about chips today, we can't look inside a silicon chip. It's just so tiny.
Yet if you did, you would see something very, very similar to this.
There's this incredible complexity in the CPU, and this incredible regularity in the memory.
If you've ever seen an electron microscope picture, you'll see this. This all looks the same, then there's this bit over here which is incredibly complicated.
All this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does, but of course you need to program this thing, and of course, Babbage used the technology of the day and the technology that would reappear in the '50s, '60s and '70s, which is punch cards. This thing over here is one of three punch card readers in here, and this is a program in the Science Museum, just not far from here, created by Charles Babbage, that is sitting there — you can go see it — waiting for the machine to be built.
And there's not just one of these, there's many of them.
He prepared programs anticipating this would happen.
Now, the reason they used punch cards was that Jacquard, in France, had created the Jacquard loom, which was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards, so he was just repurposing the technology of the day, and like everything else he did, he's using the technology of his era, so 1830s, 1840s, 1850s, cogs, steam, mechanical devices. Ironically, born the same year as Charles Babbage was Michael Faraday, who would completely revolutionize everything with the dynamo, transformers, all these sorts of things.
Babbage, of course, wanted to use proven technology, so steam and things.
Now, he needed accessories.
Obviously, you've got a computer now.
You've got punch cards, a CPU and memory.
You need accessories you're going to come with.
You're not just going to have that, So, first of all, you had sound. You had a bell, so if anything went wrong — — or the machine needed the attendant to come to it, there was a bell it could ring.
And there's actually an instruction on the punch card which says "Ring the bell." So you can imagine this "Ting!"
You know, just stop for a moment, imagine all those noises, this thing, "Click, clack click click click," steam engine, "Ding," right?
You also need a printer, obviously, and everyone needs a printer.
This is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for another machine of his, called the Difference Engine No. 2, which he never built, but which the Science Museum did build in the '80s and '90s.
It's completely mechanical, again, a printer.
It prints just numbers, because he was obsessed with numbers, but it does print onto paper, and it even does word wrapping, so if you get to the end of the line, it goes around like that.
You also need graphics, right?
I mean, if you're going to do anything with graphics, so he said, "Well, I need a plotter. I've got a big piece of paper and an ink pen and I'll make it plot."
So he designed a plotter as well, and, you know, at that point, I think he got pretty much a pretty good machine.
Along comes this woman, Ada Lovelace.
Now, imagine these soirees, all these great and good comes along.
This lady is the daughter of the mad, bad and dangerous-to-know Lord Byron, and her mother, being a bit worried that she might have inherited some of Lord Byron's madness and badness, thought, "I know the solution: Mathematics is the solution.
We'll teach her mathematics. That'll calm her down."
Because of course, there's never been a mathematician that's gone crazy, so, you know, that'll be fine.
Everything'll be fine. So she's got this mathematical training, and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother, and Charles Babbage, you know, gets out his machine.
The Duke of Wellington is there, you know, get out the machine, obviously demonstrates it, and she gets it. She's the only person in his lifetime, really, who said, "I understand what this does, and I understand the future of this machine."
And we owe to her an enormous amount because we know a lot about the machine that Babbage was intending to build because of her.
Now, some people call her the first programmer.
This is actually from one of -- the paper that she translated.
This is a program written in a particular style.
It's not, historically, totally accurate that she's the first programmer, and actually, she did something more amazing.
Rather than just being a programmer, she saw something that Babbage didn't.
Babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics.
He was building a machine to do mathematics, and Lovelace said, "You could do more than mathematics on this machine." And just as you do, everyone in this room already's got a computer on them right now, because they've got a phone.
If you go into that phone, every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom.
Whether it's video or text or music or voice, it's all numbers, it's all, underlying it, mathematical functions happening, and Lovelace said, "Just because you're doing mathematical functions and symbols doesn't mean these things can't represent other things in the real world, such as music."
This was a huge leap, because Babbage is there saying, "We could compute these amazing functions and print out tables of numbers and draw graphs," — — and Lovelace is there and she says, "Look, this thing could even compose music if you told it a representation of music numerically."
So this is what I call Lovelace's Leap.
When you say she's a programmer, she did do some, but the real thing is to have said the future is going to be much, much more than this.
Now, a hundred years later, this guy comes along, Alan Turing, and in 1936, and invents the computer all over again.
Now, of course, Babbage's machine was entirely mechanical.
Turing's machine was entirely theoretical.
Both of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective, but Turing told us something very important.
He laid down the mathematical foundations for computer science, and said, "It doesn't matter how you make a computer."
It doesn't matter if your computer's mechanical, like Babbage's was, or electronic, like computers are today, or perhaps in the future, cells, or, again, mechanical again, once we get into nanotechnology.
We could go back to Babbage's machine and just make it tiny. All those things are computers.
There is in a sense a computing essence.
This is called the Church–Turing thesis.
And so suddenly, you get this link where you say this thing Babbage had built really was a computer.
In fact, it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers, only really slowly.
To give you an idea of how slowly, it had about 1k of memory.
It used punch cards, which were being fed in, and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first ZX81.
It did have a RAM pack.
You could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to.
So, where does that bring us today?
So there are plans.
Over in Swindon, the Science Museum archives, there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages of notes written by Charles Babbage about this analytical engine.
One of those is a set of plans that we call Plan 28, and that is also the name of a charity that I started with Doron Swade, who was the curator of computing at the Science Museum, and also the person who drove the project to build a difference engine, and our plan is to build it.
Here in South Kensington, we will build the analytical engine.
The project has a number of parts to it.
One was the scanning of Babbage's archive.
That's been done. The second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build.
The third part is a computer simulation of that machine, and the last part is to physically build it at the Science Museum.
When it's built, you'll finally be able to understand how a computer works, because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you, you've got to look at this humongous thing and say, "Ah, I see the memory operating, I see the CPU operating, I hear it operating. I probably smell it operating."
But in between that we're going to do a simulation.
Babbage himself wrote, he said, as soon as the analytical engine exists, it will surely guide the future course of science.
Of course, he never built it, because he was always fiddling with new plans, but when it did get built, of course, in the 1940s, everything changed.
Now, I'll just give you a little taste of what it looks like in motion with a video which shows just one part of the CPU mechanism working.
So this is just three sets of cogs, and it's going to add. This is the adding mechanism in action, so you imagine this gigantic machine.
So, give me five years.
Before the 2030s happen, we'll have it.
Thank you very much.

<title>John Graham-Cumming: The greatest machine that never was</title>
<description>Computer science began in the '30s ... the 1830s. John Graham-Cumming tells the story of Charles Babbage's mechanical, steam-powered "analytical engine" and how Ada Lovelace, mathematician and daughter of Lord Byron, saw beyond its simple computational abilities to imagine the future of computers. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

I have a big impact on the planet to travel here by plane.
I emitted, in the atmosphere, nine tons of CO2; that is the weight of two elephants.
I came here to speak about ecology, and I emitted as much CO2 as a Frenchman in one year.
So what do I have to do?
I have to kill a Frenchman when I come back at home?
I have to do my carbon offset in another way, like I do every time.
In fact my work is to show our impact on our planet.
I'm going to show you some examples of the last pictures I've done in the last year.
Alberta sand oil, a lot of pollution.
You know the problem; we don't want to believe what we know.
In Alberta people work nonstop, 24 hours by seven to extract as much oil as they can.
We know about the end of oil.
Oil sand is not a long-term solution.
But we use three times more oil than we find every year.
We don't want to believe what we know.
Deny.
Coral reef in New Caledonia.
100 percent of the coral may be wiped out before 2050 because of global warming.
And you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature, and are very important for the biodiversity of the sea.
North Pole. I've done this picture last summer.
It was impossible to do this picture 15 years ago.
Now there is a new way open between Atlantic and Pacific.
The thickness of the Arctic decreased more than 40 percent since 1960.
There is a new face of Kilimanjaro without ice.
Sad picture.
It lost 80 percent of its ice.
According to scientists, in 100 years all the mountain glacier will be gone.
Glaciers are very important for the life on earth.
Like Al Gore told you, two billion people live on the water from the glacier of Himalaya.
Return of fish men.
One fifth of human kind depend on fish to live.
Today now 70 percent of the fish stock are over-exploited.
According to FAO, if we don't change our system of fishing the main sea resources will be gone in 2050.
We don't want to believe what we know.
The beautiful picture, by [unclear] in Africa.
One human of six have not enough to eat in the world.
One billion people have not enough to eat.
In Africa, corn is one of the main foods in many places.
Here in America, 90 percent of the corn cultivated is used to feed animals or to do oil.
Palm tree plantation in Borneo.
Every year we lose 50 thousand square miles in deforestation.
Refugee camp in Darfur.
Today we have 20 million refugees in the world.
According to the U.N., we speak about 250 million refugees in 2050.
I always show my pictures in the street.
We have done already 100 exhibitions in the cities.
But how to understand the world without the voice of people?
Landscape was not enough.
It was obvious to me to do another work.
I launched a project named Six Billion Others.
I sent around the world six cameramen asking the same question, the same crucial question, about life.
We have done five thousand interviews.
I'm going to show you this.
The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life?
It's when my dad told me, "Here, I give you this girl as your fiance."
Love? Love is nice if you can have it.
Second Romeo and Juliet, Sassi and Panno, Dodi and Diana, Heer and Ranjha, this is love! Third My greatest fear is ...
You're asking me a hard question.
Fourth I live happily because what else should I do?
Fifth The first thing I remember ...
Fifth ... from my childhood, Fifth we were having fun, biking.
Seventh We invented stories, we flew around the world, while remaining in our attic.
Eighth I had a big laugh today.
Ninth You see, family is ... it's awful.
10th In the word life, you have the life.
11th Who am I? Isn't that the biggest question?
12th If I was to go back to Iraq and speak to the people, I'd have to bow down and kiss their feet.
Just as that woman tried to kiss my feet when we were taking her sons.
I feel ashamed.
And I feel humbled by their strength.
And I will forever feel a need to make reparations to Iraq.
Second Dad, Mom, I grew up.
You shouldn't worry about me. Dad doesn't need to go to work.
My family ... What can I say?
At the moment, my family is very poor, my life here in Shenzhen is just about showing myself that I can earn more and to let my parents stay and have something to live on.
I don't want them to spend their whole lives in poverty.
If someday I can achieve something, I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy.
Thank you.
Thank you for having fed me and raised me, and for making my life of today. Thank you.
13th After seven years now of being in a wheelchair, I've done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair.
I still surf. I sail the world. I freedive.
After many people said I couldn't do that.
And I think that comes from connecting with nature, connecting with the energy of life, because we're all disabled in some way on the planet -- spiritually, mentally or physically.
I got the easy part.
14th Let's say that you and me like each other.
You come from elsewhere.
You don't know me. I don't know you.
We talk without lying.
If I do like you, I give you one cow and many other things and we become friends.
How can we make it all by ourselves?
Y You can also go to the website, answer -- respond to the questions also.
Forty crucial questions.
Now I am going to speak to you about my movie.
For the last three years, I was shooting the earth for the movie.
The name of the movie is "Home" -- "Maison."
It is about the state of the planet.
It's a fantastic story of life on the earth.
I'm very proud to show you the teaser.
This Earth is four and a half billion years old.
These plants, several hundred million years old.
And we humans have been walking upright for only 200 thousand years.
We've managed to adapt, and have conquered the whole planet.
For generations, we've been raising our children, not unlike millions of other species living beside us.
For the past 30 years I've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers from high up in the sky.
Our life is tied to the well-being of our planet.
We depend on water, forests, deserts, oceans.
Fishing, breeding, farming are still the world's foremost human occupations.
And what binds us together is far greater than what divides us.
We all share the same need for the earth's gifts -- the same wish to rise above ourselves, and become better.
And yet we carry on raising walls to keep us apart.
Today our greatest battle is to protect the natural offerings of our planet.
In less than 50 years we've altered it more thoroughly than in the entire history of mankind.
Half of the world's forests have vanished.
Water resources are running low.
Intensive farming is depleting soils.
Our energy sources are not sustainable.
The climate is changing.
We are endangering ourselves.
We're only trying to improve our lives.
But the wealth gaps are growing wider.
We haven't yet understood that we're going at a much faster pace than the planet can sustain.
We know that solutions are available today.
We all have the power to change this trend for the better.
So what are we waiting for?
Y Luc Besson is the producer of the movie.
But it is not a normal movie.
The film is going to be distributed free.
This film has no copyright.
On the five of June, the environment day, everybody can download the movie on Internet.
The film is given for free to the distributor for TV and theater to show it the fifth of June.
There is no business on this movie.
It is also available for school, cities, NGOs and you.
We have to believe what we know.
Let me tell you something.
It's too late to be pessimistic -- really too late.
We have all a part of the solutions.
To finish, I would like to welcome the 4,700th baby born since the beginning of this talk.
Merci beaucoup. I love you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_resnick_welcome_to_the_genomic_revolution.html</url>
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the human genome.
Chromosome one, top left.
Bottom right are the sex chromosomes.
Women have two copies of that big X chromosome; men have the X and, of course, that small copy of the Y.
Sorry boys, but it's just a tiny little thing that makes you different.
So if you zoom in on this genome, then what you see, of course, is this double helix structure -- the code of life spelled out with these four biochemical letters, or we call them bases, right: A, C, G and T.
How many are there in the human genome? Three billion.
Is that a big number?
Well, everybody can throw around big numbers.
But in fact, if I were to place one base on each pixel of this 1280 by 800 resolution screen, we would need 3,000 screens to take a look at the genome.
So it's really quite big.
And perhaps because of its size, a group of people -- all, by the way, with Y chromosomes -- decided they would want to sequence it.
And so 15 years, actually, and about four billion dollars later, the genome was sequenced and published.
In 2003, the final version was published, and they keep working on it.
That was all done on a machine that looks like this.
It costs about a dollar for each base -- a very slow way of doing it.
Well folks, I'm here to tell you that the world has completely changed and none of you know about it.
So now what we do is we take a genome, we make maybe 50 copies of it, we cut all those copies up into little 50-base reads, and then we sequence them, massively parallel.
And then we bring that into software, and we reassemble it and we tell you what the story is.
And so just to give you a picture of what this looks like, the Human Genome Project: 3 gigabases, right.
One run on one of these machines: 200 gigabases in a week.
And that 200 is going to change to 600 this summer, and there's no sign of this pace slowing.
So the price of a base, to sequence a base, has fallen 100 million times.
That's the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in 1998, waiting until 2011, and now you can drive to Jupiter and back twice.
World population, PC placements, the archive of all the medical literature, Moore's law, the old way of sequencing, and here's all the new stuff.
Guys, this is a log scale; you don't typically see lines that go up like that.
So the worldwide capacity to sequence human genomes is something like 50,000 to 100,000 human genomes this year.
And we know this based on the machines that are being placed.
This is expected to double, triple or maybe quadruple year over year for the foreseeable future.
In fact, there's one lab in particular that represents 20 percent of all that capacity.
It's called the Beijing Genomics Institute.
The Chinese are absolutely winning this race to the new Moon, by the way.
What does this mean for medicine?
So a woman is age 37.
She presents with stage 2 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.
She is treated with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation.
She goes home.
Two years later, she comes back with stage three C ovarian cancer.
Unfortunately, treated again with surgery and chemotherapy.
She comes back three years later at age 42 with more ovarian cancer, more chemotherapy.
Six months later, she comes back with acute myeloid leukemia.
She goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later.
So first, the way in which this woman was treated, in as little as 10 years, will look like bloodletting.
And it's because of people like my colleague, Rick Wilson, at the Genome Institute at Washington University, who decided to take a look at this woman postmortem.
And he sequenced, he took skin cells, healthy skin, and cancerous bone marrow, and he sequenced the whole genomes of both of them in a couple of weeks, no big deal.
And then he compared those two genomes in software, and what he found, among other things, was a deletion, a 2,000-base deletion across three billion bases in a particular gene called TP53.
If you have this deleterious mutation in this gene, you're 90 percent likely to get cancer in your life.
So unfortunately, this doesn't help this woman, but it does have severe, profound if you will, implications to her family.
I mean, if they have the same mutation, and they get this genetic test, and they understand it, then they can go and get regular screens, and they can catch cancer early and potentially live a significantly longer life.
Let me introduce you now to the Beery twins, diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two.
Their mom is a very brave woman who didn't believe that the symptoms weren't matching up, and through some heroic efforts and a lot of Internet searching, she was able to convince the medical community that, in fact, they had something else.
What they had was dopa-responsive dystonia.
And so they were given L-Dopa, and their symptoms did improve, but they weren't totally asymptomatic.
Significant problems remained.
Turns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named Joe Beery, who was lucky enough to be the CIO of a company called Life Technologies.
They're one of the two companies that makes these massive whole genome sequencing tools.
And so what he did was he got his kids sequenced.
And what they found was a series of mutations in a gene called SPR, which is responsible for producing serotonin, among other things.
So on top of L-Dopa, they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug, and they're effectively normal now.
Guys, this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing.
And at the time -- this was a few years ago -- it cost $100,000.
Today it's $10,000. Next year it's $1,000.
The year after it's $100, give or take a year.
That's how fast this is moving.
So here's little Nick -- likes Batman and squirt guns.
And it turns out Nick shows up at the children's hospital with this distended belly like a famine victim.
And it's not that he's not eating, it's that when he eats, his intestine basically opens up and feces spill out into his gut.
So a hundred surgeries later, he looks at his mom and says, "Mom, please pray for me. I'm in so much pain."
His pediatrician happens to have a background in clinical genetics and he has no idea what's going on, but he says, "Let's get this kid's genome sequenced."
And what they find is a single-point mutation in a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death.
So the theory is that he's having some immunological reaction to what's going on to the food essentially, and that's a natural reaction, which causes some programmed cell death.
But the gene that regulates that down is broken.
And so this informs, among other things, of course, a treatment for bone marrow transplant, which he undertakes.
And after nine months of grueling recovery, he's now eating steak with A1 sauce.
The prospect of using the genome as a universal diagnostic is upon us today.
Today, it's here.
And what it means for all of us is that everybody in this room could live an extra five, 10, 20 years just because of this one thing.
Which is a fantastic story, unless you think about humanity's footprint on the planet and our ability to keep up food production.
So it turns out that the very same technology is also being used to grow new lines of corn, wheat, soybean and other crops that are highly tolerant of drought, of flood, of pests and pesticides.
Now look, as long as we continue to increase the population, we're going to have to continue to grow and eat genetically modified foods, and that's the only position that I'll take today.
Unless there's anybody in the audience that would like to volunteer to stop eating?
None, not one.
This is a typewriter, a staple of every desktop for decades.
And in fact, the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing.
And then more general versions of word processors came about.
But ultimately, it was a disruption on top of a disruption.
It was Bob Metcalfe inventing the Ethernet and the connection of all these computers that fundamentally changed everything.
And suddenly we had Netscape, and we had Yahoo and we had, indeed, the entire dotcom bubble.
Not to worry though, that was quickly rescued by the iPod, Facebook and, indeed, angry birds.
Look, this is where we are today.
This is the genomic revolution today. This is where we are.
So what I'd like you to consider is: What does it mean when these dots don't represent the individual bases of your genome, but they connect to genomes all across the planet?
So I just recently had to buy life insurance.
And I was required to answer: A. I have never had a genetic test, B. I've had one, here you go, and C. I've had one and I'm not telling.
Thankfully, I was able to answer A, and I say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening.
But what would have happened if I had said C?
Consumer applications for genomics, they will flourish.
Do you want to see whether you're genetically compatible with your girlfriend? Sure.
DNA sequencing on your iPhone? There's an app for that.
Personalized genomic massage anyone?
There's already a lab today that tests for allele 334 of the AVPR1 gene, the so-called cheating gene.
So anybody who's here today with your significant other, just turn over to them and swab their mouth, send it to the lab and you'll know for sure.
Do you really want to elect a president whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy?
Now think of it, it's 2016 and the leading candidate releases not only her four years of back tax returns, but also her personal genome.
And it looks really good.
And then she challenges all of her competitors to do the same.
Do you think that's not going to happen?
Do you think it would have helped John McCain?
How many people in the audience have the last name Resnick like me? Raise your hand.
Anybody? Nobody.
Typically, there's one or two.
So my father's father was one of 10 Resnick brothers.
They all hated each other.
And they all moved to different parts of the planet.
So it's likely that I'm related to every Resnick that I ever meet, but I don't know.
But imagine if my genome were deidentified, sitting in software, and a third cousin's genome was also sitting there, and there was software that could compare these two and make these associations.
Not hard to imagine. My company has software that does this right now.
And so imagine one more thing: that that software is able to ask both parties for mutual consents, "Would you be willing to meet your third cousin?"
And if we both say yes, voila! Welcome to chromosomally LinkedIn.
Now this is probably a good thing, right?
You have bigger clan gatherings and so on.
But maybe it's a bad thing as well.
How many fathers in the room? Raise your hands.
Okay, so experts think that one to three percent of you are not actually the father of your child.
Look -- These genomes, these 23 chromosomes, they don't in any way represent the quality of our relationships or the nature of our society -- at least not yet.
And like any new technology, it's really in humanity's hands to wield it for the betterment of mankind, or not.
And so I urge you all to wake up and to tune in and to influence the genomic revolution that's happening all around you.
Thank you.

So I am a pediatric cancer doctor and stem-cell researcher at Stanford University where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation.
Now, inspired by Jill Bolte Taylor last year, I didn't bring a human brain, but I did bring a liter of bone marrow.
And bone marrow is actually what we use to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients, most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma and some other diseases.
So, a few years ago, I'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford.
I'm in the operating room. We have Bob here, who is a volunteer donor.
We're sending his marrow across the country to save the life of a child with leukemia.
So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow?
Well we have a whole O.R. team, general anesthesia, nurses, and another doctor across from me.
Bob's on the table, and we take this sort of small needle, you know, not too big.
And the way we do this is we basically place this through the soft tissue, and kind of punch it into the hard bone, into the tuchus -- that's a technical term -- and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out, each time, with a syringe.
And hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin.
Hands it back to me. And we do that again and again.
About 200 times usually.
And by the end of this my arm is sore, I've got a callus on my hand, let alone Bob, whose rear end looks something more like this, like Swiss cheese.
So I'm thinking, you know, this procedure hasn't changed in about 40 years.
And there is probably a better way to do this.
So I thought of a minimally invasive approach, and a new device that we call the Marrow Miner.
This is it.
And the Marrow Miner, the way it works is shown here.
Our standard see-through patient.
Instead of entering the bone dozens of times, we enter just once, into the front of the hip or the back of the hip.
And we have a flexible, powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip, as it moves around.
So it enables you to very rapidly aspirate, or suck out, rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole.
We can do multiple passes through that same entry.
No robots required.
And, so, very quickly, Bob can just get one puncture, local anesthesia, and do this harvest as an outpatient.
So I did a few prototypes. I got a small little grant at Stanford.
And played around with this a little bit.
And our team members developed this technology.
And eventually we got two large animals, and pig studies.
And we found, to our surprise, that we not only got bone marrow out, but we got 10 times the stem cell activity in the marrow from the Marrow Miner, compared to the normal device.
This device was just FDA approved in the last year.
Here is a live patient. You can see it following the flexible curves around.
There will be two passes here, in the same patient, from the same hole.
This was done under local anesthesia, as an outpatient.
And we got, again, about three to six times more stem cells than the standard approach done on the same patient.
So why should you care? Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells.
You all know about embryonic stem cells.
They've got great potential but haven't yet entered clinical trials.
Adult stem cells are throughout our body, including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow, which we've been using as a form of stem-cell therapy for over 40 years.
In the last decade there's been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases such as heart disease, vascular disease, orthopedics, tissue engineering, even in neurology to treat Parkinson's and diabetes.
We've just come out, we're commercializing, this year, generation 2.0 of the Marrow Miner.
The hope is that this gets more stem cells out, which translates to better outcomes.
It may encourage more people to sign up to be potential live-saving bone marrow donors.
It may even enable you to bank your own marrow stem cells, when you're younger and healthier, to use in the future should you need it.
And ultimately -- and here's a picture of our bone marrow transplant survivors, who come together for a reunion each year at Stanford.
Hopefully this technology will let us have more of these survivors in the future.
Thanks.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/garrett_lisi_on_his_theory_of_everything.html</url>
Whoa, dude. Check out those killer equations. Sweet.
Actually, for the next 18 minutes I'm going to do the best I can to describe the beauty of particle physics without equations.
It turns out there's a lot we can learn from coral.
Coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal.
Each coral head consists of thousand of individual polyps.
These polyps are continually budding and branching into genetically identical neighbors.
If we imagine this to be a hyper-intelligent coral, we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question.
We can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location compared to his neighbors -- if it was just chance, or destiny, or what?
Now, after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high, he would tell us that our question was completely stupid.
These corals can be quite kind of mean, you see, and I have surfing scars to prove that.
But this polyp would continue and tell us that his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him.
That he was in all these other locations as well, but experiencing them as separate individuals.
For a coral, branching into different copies is the most natural thing in the world.
Unlike us, a hyper-intelligent coral would be uniquely prepared to understand quantum mechanics.
The mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately describes how our universe works.
And it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities, just like a coral.
It's a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around, since we only ever get to experience one possibility.
This quantum weirdness was first described by Erwin Schrödinger and his cat.
The cat likes this version better.
In this setup, Schrödinger is in a box with a radioactive sample that, by the laws of quantum mechanics, branches into a state in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not.
In the branch in which the sample radiates, it sets off a trigger that releases poison and Schrödinger is dead.
But in the other branch of reality, he remains alive.
These realities are experienced separately by each individual.
As far as either can tell, the other one doesn't exist.
This seems weird to us, because each of us only experiences an individual existence, and we don't get to see other branches.
It's as if each of us, like Schrödinger here, are a kind of coral branching into different possibilities.
The mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us this is how the world works at tiny scales.
It can be summed up in a single sentence: Everything that can happen, does.
That's quantum mechanics.
But this does not mean everything happens.
The rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what can't.
What physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry and the interactions of elementary particles.
And things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced.
Now I'll go ahead and describe how we know about these particles, what they are and how this balance works.
In this machine, a beam of protons and anti-protons are accelerated to near the speed of light and brought together in a collision, producing a burst of pure energy.
This energy is immediately converted into a spray of subatomic particles, with detectors and computers used to figure out their properties.
This enormous machine -- the large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva -- has a circumference of 17 miles and, when it's operating, draws five times as much power as the city of Monterey.
We can't predict specifically what particles will be produced in any individual collision.
Quantum mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized.
But physics does tell us what particles can be produced.
These particles must have just as much mass and energy as is carried in by the proton and anti-proton.
Any particles more massive than this energy limit aren't produced, and remain invisible to us.
This is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting.
It's going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what's ever been done before, so we're going to get to see some new particles very soon.
But before talking about what we might see, let me describe the particles we already know of.
There's a whole zoo of subatomic particles.
Most of us are familiar with electrons.
A lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around.
But the electron also has a neutral partner called the neutrino, with no electric charge and a very tiny mass.
In contrast, the up-and-down quarks have very large masses, and combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons inside atoms.
All of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties, and have anti-particle partners that carry opposite charges.
These familiar particles also have less familiar second and third generations, which have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses.
These matter particles all interact with the various force particles.
The electromagnetic force interacts with electrically charged matter via particles called photons.
There is also a very weak force called, rather unimaginatively, the weak force, that interacts only with left-handed matter.
The strong force acts between quarks which carry a different kind of charge, called color charge, and come in three different varieties: red, green and blue.
You can blame Murray Gell-Mann for these names -- they're his fault.
Finally, there's the force of gravity, which interacts with matter via its mass and spin.
The most important thing to understand here is that there's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces.
These four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has.
A particle that hasn't been seen yet, but we're pretty sure exists, is the Higgs particle, which gives masses to all these other particles.
The main purpose of the Large Hadron Collider is to see this Higgs particle, and we're almost certain it will.
But the greatest mystery is what else we might see.
And I'm going to show you one beautiful possibility towards the end of this talk.
Now, if we count up all these different particles using their various spins and charges, there are 226.
That's a lot of particles to keep track of.
And it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles.
But if we plot them out according to their charges, some beautiful patterns emerge.
The most familiar charge is electric charge.
Electrons have an electric charge, a negative one, and quarks have electric charges in thirds.
So when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton, it has a total electric charge of plus one.
These particles also have anti-particles, which have opposite charges.
Now, it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges: hypercharge and weak charge.
If we spread out the hypercharge and weak charge and plot the charges of particles in this two-dimensional charge space, the electric charge is where these particles sit along the vertical direction.
The electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter according to their hypercharge and weak charge, which make this pattern.
This is called the Unified Electroweak Model, and it was put together back in 1967.
The reason most of us are only familiar with electric charge and not both of these is because of the Higgs particle.
The Higgs, over here on the left, has a large mass and breaks the symmetry of this electroweak pattern.
It makes the weak force very weak by giving the weak particles a large mass.
Since this massive Higgs sits along the horizontal direction in this diagram, the photons of electromagnetism remain massless and interact with electric charge along the vertical direction in this charge space.
So the electromagnetic and weak forces are described by this pattern of particle charges in two-dimensional space.
We can include the strong force by spreading out its two charge directions and plotting the charges of the force particles in quarks along these directions.
The charges of all known particles can be plotted in a four-dimensional charge space, and projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them.
Whenever particles interact, nature keeps things in a perfect balance along all four of these charge directions.
If a particle and an anti-particle collide, it creates a burst of energy and a total charge of zero in all four charge directions.
At this point, anything can be created as long as it has the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero.
For example, this weak force particle and its anti-particle can be created in a collision.
In further interactions, the charges must always balance.
One of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an anti-neutrino, and these three still add to zero total charge.
Nature always keeps a perfect balance.
So these patterns of charges are not just pretty.
They tell us what interactions are allowed to happen.
And we can rotate this charge space in four dimensions to get a better look at the strong interaction, which has this nice hexagonal symmetry.
In a strong interaction, a strong force particle, such as this one, interacts with a colored quark, such as this green one, to give a quark with a different color charge -- this red one.
And strong interactions are happening millions of times each second in every atom of our bodies, holding the atomic nuclei together.
But these four charges corresponding to three forces are not the end of the story.
We can also include two more charges corresponding to the gravitational force.
When we include these, each matter particle has two different spin charges, spin-up and spin-down.
So they all split, and give a nice pattern in six-dimensional charge space.
We can rotate this pattern in six dimensions, and see that it's quite pretty.
Right now, this pattern matches our best current knowledge of how nature is built at the tiny scales of these elementary particles.
This is what we know for certain.
Some of these particles are at the very limit of what we've been able to reach with experiments.
From this pattern, we already know the particle physics of these tiny scales. The way the universe works with these tiny scales is very beautiful.
But now I'm going to discuss some new and old ideas about things we don't know yet.
We want to expand this pattern using mathematics alone, and see if we can get our hands on the whole enchilada.
We want to find all the particles and forces that make a complete picture of our universe.
And we want to use this picture to predict new particles that we'll see when experiments reach higher energies.
So there's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges, which is not very symmetric, could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken -- similar to how the Higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism.
In order to do this, we need to introduce new forces with new charge directions.
When we introduce a new direction, we get to guess what charges the particles have along this direction, and then we can rotate it in with the others.
If we guess wisely, we can construct the standard charges in six charge dimensions as a broken symmetry of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions.
This particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory introduced by Pati and Salam in 1973.
When we look at this new unified pattern, we can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing.
This is the way theories of unification work.
A physicist looks for larger, more symmetric patterns that include the established pattern as a subset.
The larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen.
This unification model predicts the existence of these two new force particles, which should act a lot like the weak force, only weaker.
Now we can rotate this set of charges in seven dimensions and consider an odd fact about the matter particles: the second and third generations of matter have exactly the same charges in six-dimensional charge space as the first generation.
These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges.
They sit on top of one another in the standard charge space.
However, if we work in eight-dimensional charge space, then we can assign unique new charges to each particle.
Then we can spin these in eight dimensions, and see what the whole pattern looks like.
Here we can see the second and third generations of matter now related to the first generation by a symmetry called "triality."
This particular pattern of charges in eight dimensions is actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics.
It's a pattern of the largest exceptional Lie group, E8.
This Lie group is a smooth, curved shape with 248 dimensions.
Each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape.
One small part of this E8 shape can be used to describe the curved space-time of Einstein's general relativity, explaining gravity.
Together with quantum mechanics, the geometry of this shape could describe everything about how the universe works at the tiniest scales.
The pattern of this shape living in eight-dimensional charge space is exquisitely beautiful, and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions between these elementary particles, each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape.
As we spin it, we can see many of the other intricate patterns contained in this one.
And with a particular rotation, we can look down through this pattern in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis and see all the particles at once.
It's a very beautiful object, and as with any unification, we can see some holes where new particles are required by this pattern.
There are 20 gaps where new particles should be, two of which have been filled by the Pati-Salam particles.
From their location in this pattern, we know that these new particles should be scalar fields like the Higgs particle, but have color charge and interact with the strong force.
Filling in these new particles completes this pattern, giving us the full E8.
This E8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots.
It's considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in mathematics.
It's a fantastic prospect that this object of great mathematical beauty could describe the truth of particle interactions at the smallest scales imaginable.
And this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new.
In 1623, Galileo wrote this: "Nature's grand book, which stands continually open to our gaze, is written in the language of mathematics.
Its characters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth."
I believe this to be true, and I've tried to follow Galileo's guidance in describing the mathematics of particle physics using only triangles, circles and other geometrical figures.
Of course, when other physicists and I actually work on this stuff, the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth.
But it's reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics is pure, beautiful geometry.
Joined with quantum mechanics, this mathematics describes our universe as a growing E8 coral, with particles interacting at every location in all possible ways according to a beautiful pattern.
And as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines like the Large Hadron Collider, we may be able to see whether nature uses this E8 pattern or a different one.
This process of discovery is a wonderful adventure to be involved in.
If the LHC finds particles that fit this E8 pattern, that will be very, very cool.
If the LHC finds new particles, but they don't fit this pattern -- well, that will be very interesting, but bad for this E8 theory.
And, of course, bad for me personally.
Now how bad would that be?
Well, pretty bad.
But predicting how nature works is a very risky game.
This theory and others like it are long shots.
One does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably won't end up being true about nature.
That's what doing theoretical physics is like: there are a lot of wipeouts.
In this regard, new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies.
As with any large investment, it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn't working out.
But in science, if something isn't working, you have to toss it out and try something else.
Now, the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty is to keep balance and perspective in life.
I've tried the best I can to live a balanced life.
I try to balance my life equally between physics, love and surfing -- my own three charge directions.
This way, even if the physics I work on comes to nothing, I still know I've lived a good life.
And I try to live in beautiful places.
For most of the past ten years I've lived on the island of Maui, a very beautiful place.
Now it's one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents how I managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full-time employment.
I'm going to let you in on that secret.
This was a view from my home office on Maui.
And this is another, and another.
And you may have noticed that these beautiful views are similar, but in slightly different places.
That's because this used to be my home and office on Maui.
I've chosen a very unusual life.
But not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time doing what I love.
Living a nomadic existence has been hard at times, but it's allowed me to live in beautiful places and keep a balance in my life that I've been happy with.
It allows me to spend a lot of my time hanging out with hyper-intelligent coral.
But I also greatly enjoy the company of hyper-intelligent people.
So I'm very happy to have been invited here to TED.
Thank you very much.
I probably understood two percent of that, but I still absolutely loved it. So I'm going to sound dumb.
Your theory of everything -- Garrett Lisi: I'm used to coral.
That's right. The reason it's got a few people at least excited is because, if you're right, it brings gravity and quantum theory together.
So are you saying that we should think of the universe, at its heart -- that the smallest things that there are, are somehow an E8 object of possibility?
I mean, is there a scale to it, at the smallest scale, or ...?
GL: Well, right now the pattern I showed you that corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics -- that already corresponds to a very beautiful shape.
And that's the one that I said we knew for certain.
And that shape has remarkable similarities -- and the way it fits into this E8 pattern could be the rest of the picture.
And these patterns of points that I've shown for you actually represent symmetries of this high-dimensional object that would be warping and moving and dancing over the space time that we experience.
And that would be what explains all these elementary particles that we see.
But a string theorist, as I understand it, explains electrons in terms of much smaller strings vibrating -- I know you don't like string theory -- vibrating inside it.
How should we think of an electron in relation to E8?
GL: No, it would be one of the symmetries of this E8 shape.
So what's happening is, as the shape is moving over space-time, it's twisting. And the direction it's twisting as it moves is what particle we see. So it would be -- The size of the E8 shape, how does that relate to the electron?
I kind of feel like I need that for my picture.
Is it bigger? Is it smaller?
GL: Well, as far as we know electrons are point particles, so this would be going down to the smallest possible scales.
So the way these things are explained in quantum field theory is, all possibilities are expanding and developing at once.
And this is why I use the analogy to coral.
And in this way, the way that E8 comes in is it will be as a shape that's attached at each point in space-time.
And, as I said, the way the shape twists -- the directional along which way the shape is twisting as it moves over this curved surface -- is what the elementary particles are, themselves.
So through quantum field theory, they manifest themselves as points and interact that way.
I don't know if I'll be able to make this any clearer.
It doesn't really matter.
It's evoking a kind of sense of wonder, and I certainly want to understand more of this.
But thank you so much for coming. That was absolutely fascinating.

Good afternoon, good evening, whatever.
We can go, jambo, guten Abend, bonsoir, but we can also ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
That is the call that chimpanzees make before they go to sleep in the evening.
You hear it going from one side of the valley to the other, from one group of nests to the next.
And I want to pick up with my talk this evening from where Zeray left off yesterday.
He was talking about this amazing, three-year-old Australopithecine child, Selam.
And we've also been hearing about the history, the family tree, of mankind through DNA genetic profiling.
And it was a paleontologist, the late Louis Leakey, who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees.
And it was pretty extraordinary, way back then.
It's kind of commonplace now, but his argument was -- because he'd been searching for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa.
And you can tell an awful lot about what those beings looked like from the fossils, from the shape of the muscle attachments, something about the way they lived from the various artifacts found with them.
But what about how they behaved? That's what he wanted to know.
And of course, behavior doesn't fossilize.
He argued -- and it's now a fairly common theory -- that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same in our closest living relatives, the great apes, and humans today, then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like, human-like ancestor some seven million years ago.
And therefore, perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us from that ancient, ancient past.
Well, if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution, you very often find people speculating about how early humans may have behaved, based on the behavior of chimpanzees.
They are more like us than any other living creature, and we've heard about that during this TED Conference.
So it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees are so like us, in certain aspects of their behavior.
Every chimpanzee has his or her own personality.
Of course, I gave them names. They can live to be 60 years or more, although we think most of them probably don't make it to 60 in the wild.
Mr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's 11 or 12.
Thereafter, she has one baby only every five or six years, a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing, sleeping with the mother at night, and riding on her back.
And we believe that this long period of childhood is important for chimpanzees, just as it is for us, in relation to learning.
As the brain becomes ever more complex during evolution in different forms of animals, so we find that learning plays an ever more important role in an individual's life history.
And young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do.
We know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see.
And we believe that it's in this way that the different tool-using behaviors -- that have now been seen in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa -- how these are passed from one generation to the next, through observation, imitation and practice, so that we can describe these tool-using behaviors as primitive culture.
Chimpanzees don't have a spoken language. We've talked about that.
They do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures, many of which are similar, or even identical, to ours and formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing.
They also kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the back.
And they swagger and they throw rocks.
In chimpanzee society, we find many, many examples of compassion, precursors to love and true altruism.
Unfortunately, they, like us, have a dark side to their nature.
They're capable of extreme brutality, even a kind of primitive war.
And these really aggressive behaviors, for the most part, are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group.
They are very territorially aggressive.
Chimpanzees, I believe, more than any other living creature, have helped us to understand that, after all, there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.
It's a very blurry line, and it's getting more blurry all the time as we make even more observations.
The study that I began in 1960 is still continuing to this day.
And these chimpanzees, living their complex social lives in the wild, have helped -- more than anything else -- to make us realize we are part of, and not separated from, the amazing animals with whom we share the planet.
So it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees, like so many other creatures around the world, are losing their habitats.
This is just one photograph from the air, and it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe.
And it was when I flew over the whole area, about 16 years ago, and realized that outside the park, this forest, which in 1960 had stretched almost unbroken along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, which is where the tiny, 30-square-mile Gombe National Park lies, that a question came to my mind.
"How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees, when the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive?"
More people are living there than the land could possibly support.
The numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi and over the lake from Congo.
And very poor people -- they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere.
This led to a program, which we call TACARE.
It's a very holistic way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park.
It started small with 12 villages. It's now in 24.
There isn't time to go into it, but it's including things like tree nurseries, methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded, almost desert-like land up in these mountains.
Ways of controlling, preventing soil erosion.
Ways of reclaiming overused farmland, so that within two years they can again be productive.
Working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells.
Perhaps build some schoolrooms.
Most important of all, I believe, is working with small groups of women, providing them with opportunities for micro-credit loans.
And we've got, as is the case around the world, about 95 percent of all loans returned.
Empowering women, working with education, providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school, in the clear understanding that, all around the world, as women's education improves, family size drops.
We provide information about family planning and about HIV/AIDS.
And as a result of this program, something's happening for conservation.
What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages, instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys -- and by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian -- but when we began the TACARE program, it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages.
It was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers, asking what they were interested in.
Were they interested in conservation? Absolutely not.
They were interested in health; they were interested in education.
And as time went on, and as their situation began to improve, they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation.
They began to understand that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees, so you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides.
Today, we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem.
This is an area way outside the National Park, stretching out into all these very degraded lands.
And as these villages have a better standard of life, they are actually agreeing to put between 10 percent and 20 percent of their land in the highlands aside, so that once again, as the trees grow back, the chimpanzees will have leafy corridors through which they can travel to interact -- as they must for genetic viability -- with other remnant groups outside the National Park.
So TACARE is a success.
We're replicating it in other parts of Africa, around other wilderness areas which are faced with extreme population pressure.
The problems in Africa, however, as we've been discussing for the whole of these first couple of days of TED, are major problems.
There is a great deal of poverty.
And when you get large numbers of people living in land that is not that fertile, particularly when you cut down trees, and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion, as desperate populations cut down more and more trees, so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families, what's going to happen? Something's got to give.
And the other problems -- in not only Africa, but the rest of the developing world and, indeed, everywhere -- what are we doing to our planet?
You know, the famous scientist, E. O. Wilson said that if every person on this planet attains the standard of living of the average European or American, we need three new planets.
Today, they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one.
And what's happened? I mean, the question here is, here we are, arguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth, with this extraordinary brain, capable of the kind of technology that is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences, and yet we're destroying the only home we have.
The indigenous people around the world, before they made a major decision, used to sit around and ask themselves, "How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?"
Today, major decisions -- and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here, but the developed world -- major decisions involving millions of dollars, and millions of people, are often based on, "How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting?"
And these decisions affect Africa.
As I began traveling around Africa talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests, I realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation.
So I began traveling outside Africa, talking in Europe, talking in the United States, going to Asia.
And everywhere there were these terrible problems.
And you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution.
The air that we breathe that often poisons us.
The earth is poisoning our foods.
The water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we're going to face in this century -- and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural, industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world, seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience.
The mangroves are being cut down; the effects of things like the tsunami get worse.
We've talked about the soil erosion.
We have the reckless burning of fossil fuels along with other greenhouse gasses, so called, leading to climate change.
Finally, all around the world, people have begun to believe that there is something going on very wrong with our climate.
All around the world climates are mixed up.
And it's the poor people who are affected worse.
It's Africa that already is affected.
In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the droughts are so much worse.
And when the rain does come, it so often leads to flooding and added distress, and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease.
And the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support, who are too poor to buy food, who can't move away because the whole land is degraded.
And so you get desertification -- creeping, creeping, creeping -- as the last of the trees are cut down.
And this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world.
So it wasn't surprising to me that as I was traveling around the world I met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope.
We seem to have lost wisdom, the wisdom of the indigenous people.
I asked a question. "Why?"
Well, do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain, the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify, and the human heart? Talking about it in the non-scientific term, in terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect?
And these young people, when I talk to them, basically they were either depressed or apathetic, or bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing, "We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future and there's nothing we can do about it."
We have compromised their future.
I've got three little grandchildren, and every time I look at them and I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age, I feel this desperation.
And that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots, which began right here in Tanzania and has now spread to 97 countries around the world.
It's symbolic. Roots make a firm foundation.
Shoots seem tiny; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall.
See the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet, environmental and social. It's a message of hope.
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world for all living things.
The most important message of Roots and Shoots: every single one of us makes a difference, every single day.
We have a choice. Every one of us in this room, we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make.
The very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things so that the poor have choice as well.
The Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects.
It depends on how old they are, and which country, whether they're in a city or rural, as to what kinds of projects.
But basically, we have programs now from preschool right through university, with more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups.
And every group chooses, between them, three different kinds of project to make this a better world, recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected and impinge on each other.
So one of their projects will be to help their own human community.
And then, if they're able, they may raise money to help communities in other parts of the world.
One of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife, domestic animals as well.
And one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share.
And woven throughout all of this is a message of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves, in our families, in our communities, between nations, between cultures, between religions and between us and the natural world.
We need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are.
We not do have more than this one planet.
Just picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa that the Roots and Shoots groups are doing, one or two projects only -- in Tanzania, in Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, Congo-Brazzaville, Sierra Leone, Cameroon and other groups. And as I say, it's in 97 countries around the world.
Of course, they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables.
They're working in the refugee camps, with chickens and selling the eggs for a little amount of money, or just using them to feed their families, and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment, because they're no longer helpless and depending on others with their vegetables and their chickens.
It's being used in Uganda to give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers.
Doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves.
Once again, they're useful members of society.
We have this program in prisons as well.
So, there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now.
But -- oh, they're also working on HIV/AIDS.
That's a very important component of Roots and Shoots, with older kids talking to younger ones.
And unwanted pregnancies and things like that, which young people listen to better from other youth, rather than adults.
Hope. That's the question I get asked as I'm going around the world: "Jane, you've seen so many terrible things, you've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number from about one million, at the turn of the century, to no more than 150,000 now, and the same with so many other animals.
Forests disappearing, deserts where once there was forest.
Do you really have hope?" Well, yes.
You can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope, can you?
And of course, there's hope. One is this amazing human brain.
And I mean, think of the technologies.
And I've just been so thrilled, finally, to come to people talking about compost latrines.
It's one of my hobbyhorses.
We just flush all this water down the lavatory, it's terrible.
And then talking about renewable energy -- desperately important.
Do we care about the planet for our children?
How many of us have children or grandchildren, nieces, nephews?
Do we care about their future?
And if we care about their future, we, as the elite around the world, we can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day.
What we buy. What we wear.
And choose to make these choices with the question, how will this affect the environment around me?
How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up?
Or my grandchild, or whatever it is.
So the human brain, coupled with the human heart, and we join hands around the world.
And that's what TED is helping so well with, and Google who help us, and Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park.
All of these technologies we can use.
Now let's link them, and it's beginning to happen, isn't it?
You've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen.
This change, this change. To see change that we must have if we care about the future.
And the next reason for hope -- nature is amazingly resilient.
You can take an area that's absolutely destroyed, with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate.
And an example is the TACARE program.
I told you, where a seemingly dead tree stump -- if you stop hacking them for firewood, which you don't need to because you have wood lots, then in five years you can have a 30-foot tree.
And animals, almost on the brink of extinction, can be given a second chance. That's my next book.
It's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope, and we've heard about this so much in the last two days: this indomitable human spirit. This determination of people, the resilience of the human spirit, So that people who you would think would be battered by poverty, or disease, or whatever, can pull themselves up out of it, sometimes with a helping hand, and take their part in society, and take their part in changing the world.
And just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring.
We could make a very long list, but obviously Nelson Mandela, emerging from 17 years of hard physical labor, 23 years of imprisonment, with this amazing ability to forgive, so that he could lead his nation out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath.
Ken Saro-Wiwa, in Nigeria, who took on the giant oil companies, and although people around the world tried their best, was executed.
People like this are so inspirational.
People like this are the role models we need for young Africans.
And we need some environmental role models as well, and I've been hearing some of them today.
So I'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message again, with everyone at TED.
And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things, especially the Roots and Shoots program.
And just a last word on that -- the young woman who's running this entire conference center, I met her today.
She came up so excited, with her certificate. She was [in] Roots and Shoots.
She was in the leadership in Dar es Salaam.
She said it's helped her to do what she's doing.
And it was very, very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people, when they are empowered, given the opportunity to take action, to make the world a better place, truly are our hope for tomorrow.
Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/dianna_cohen_tough_truths_about_plastic_pollution.html</url>
I'm a visual artist, and I'm also one of the co-founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition.
I've been working with plastic bags, which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork for the last 20 years.
I turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations.
Upon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years, some of my work started to fissure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic.
And I thought, "Great.
It's ephemeral just like us."
Upon educating myself a little further about plastics, I actually realized this was a bad thing.
It's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits, because it's always still plastic.
And what we're finding is that a lot of it is in the marine environment.
I then, in the last few years, learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre.
And my initial reaction -- and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction to learning about it -- is, "Oh my God!
We've got to go out there and clean this thing up."
So I actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommissioned fishing trawlers, a crane, a chipping machine and a cold-molding machine.
And my intention was to go out to the gyre, raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic, chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities.
I began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so, I realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world, and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture.
And the bigger picture is: we need to find a way to turn off the faucet.
We need to cut the spigot of single-use and disposable plastics, which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale.
So in looking at that, I also realized that I was really angry.
I wasn't just concerned about plastic that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean -- of which I have learned there are now 11 gyres, potentially, of plastic in five major oceans in the world.
It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about -- it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket.
I'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic.
All of my beverages are packaged in plastic, even at the health food market.
I'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator, and I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic into us and into our bodies.
So I came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue, and we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition.
We have many initiatives that we're working on, but some of them are very basic.
One is: if 80 to 90 percent of what we're finding in the ocean -- of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean -- is plastic, then why don't we call it what it is.
It's plastic pollution.
Recycling -- everybody kind of ends their books about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling.
You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again.
What is the reality of that?
In the United States, less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled.
And if you really look into it, particularly when it comes to plastic bottles, most of it is only down-cycled, or incinerated, or shipped to China.
It is down-cycled and turned into lesser things, while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or can be used again -- a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again.
So this is a big issue for us.
Another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about is we've added a fourth R onto the front of the "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle," three R's, and that is refuse.
Whenever possible, refuse single-use and disposable plastics.
Alternatives exist; some of them are very old-school.
I myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers to store food in.
And I know that I am doing a service to myself and my family.
It's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle or a glass bottle, if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle and fill that up with water or filtered water, versus purchasing plastic bottled water.
I guess what I want to say to everybody here -- and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue -- is that this is a huge problem in the oceans, but this is a problem that we've created as consumers and we can solve.
We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue and teaching people to choose alternatives.
So whenever possible, to choose alternatives to single-use plastics.
We can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this into our oceans and in doing so, save our oceans, save our planet, save ourselves.
Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/pattie_maes_demos_the_sixth_sense.html</url>
I've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense -- a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to meta-information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we're coming across.
And some of you may argue, well, don't today's cell phones do that already?
But I would say no.
When you meet someone here at TED -- and this is the top networking place, of course, of the year -- you don't shake somebody's hand and then say, "Can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you?"
Or when you go to the supermarket and you're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers, you don't take out your cell phone, and open a browser, and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make.
So we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take.
And so my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way, without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior.
And I'm here to unveil our latest effort, and most successful effort so far, which is still very much a work in process.
I'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf -- and that, by the way, only cost 350 dollars at this point in time.
I'm wearing a camera, just a simple webcam, a portable, battery-powered projection system with a little mirror.
These components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket which acts as the communication and computation device.
And in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry, who's really the genius who's been implementing and designing this whole system.
And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him.
The system tracks the four significant fingers.
In this case, he's wearing simple marker caps that you may recognize.
But if you want a more stylish version you could also paint your nails in different colors.
And the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he's making so he can just go to, for example, a map of Long Beach, zoom in and out, etc.
The system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the "take a picture" gesture, and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you.
And when he then walks back to the Media Lab, he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he's taken, sort through them and organize them, and re-size them, etc., again using all natural gestures.
So, some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by Jeff Han or some of you may think, "Well, doesn't this look like the Microsoft Surface Table?"
And yes, you also interact using natural gestures, both hands, etc.
But the difference here is that you can use any surface, you can walk to up to any surface, including your hand if nothing else is available and interact with this projected data.
The device is completely portable, and can be ...
So one important difference is that it's totally mobile.
Another even more important difference is that in mass production this would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging -- could look a lot more stylish than this version that I'm wearing around my neck.
But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in "Minority Report," the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you.
So we see Pranav here going into the supermarket and he's shopping for some paper towels.
And, as he picks up a product the system can recognize the product that he's picking up, using either image recognition or marker technology, and give him the green light or an orange light.
He can ask for additional information.
So this particular choice here is a particularly good choice, given his personal criteria.
Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically-responsible choice.
If he picks up a book in the bookstore, he can get an Amazon rating -- it gets projected right on the cover of the book.
This is Juan's book, our previous speaker, which gets a great rating, by the way, at Amazon.
And so, Pranav turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book -- reader comments, maybe sort of information by his favorite critic, etc.
If he turns to a particular page he finds an annotation by maybe an expert of a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page.
Reading the newspaper -- it never has to be outdated.
You can get video annotations of the event that you're reading about You can get the latest sports scores etc.
This is a more controversial one.
As you interact with someone at TED, maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags, the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages.
In this case, the student is interested in cameras, etc.
On your way to the airport, if you pick up your boarding pass, it can tell you that your flight is delayed, that the gate has changed, etc.
And, if you need to know what the current time is it's as simple as drawing a watch -- on your arm.
So that's where we're at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we may come across.
My student Pranav, who's really, like I said, the genius behind this.
He does deserve a lot of applause because I don't think he's slept much in the last three months, actually.
And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either.
But it's not perfect yet, it's very much a work in progress.
And who knows, maybe in another 10 years we'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant.
Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/9_11_healing_the_mothers_who_found_forgiveness_friendship.html</url>
Phyllis Rodriguez: We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship.
And it is.
And yet, it feels natural to us now.
I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11th, 2001.
We didn't know if he had perished yet until 36 hours later.
At the time, we knew that it was political.
We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son -- my husband, Orlando, and I and our family.
And when I saw it -- and yet, through the shock, the terrible shock, and the terrible explosion in our lives, literally, we were not vengeful.
And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism, and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him, if convicted, my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that, publicly.
Through that and through human rights groups, we were brought together with several other victims' families.
When I saw Aicha in the media, coming over when her son was indicted, and I thought, "What a brave woman.
Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger."
I was still in deep grief; I knew I didn't have the strength.
I knew I would find her someday, or we would find each other.
Because, when people heard that my son was a victim, I got immediate sympathy.
But when people learned what her son was accused of, she didn't get that sympathy.
But her suffering is equal to mine.
So we met in November 2002, and Aicha will now tell you how that came about.
Aicha el-Wafi: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui.
And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims.
So they introduced me to five families.
And I saw Phyllis, and I watched her.
She was the only mother in the group.
The others were brothers, sisters.
And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother, just like me.
I suffered a lot as a mother.
I was married when I was 14.
I lost a child when I was 15, a second child when I was 16.
So the story with Zacarias was too much really.
And I still suffer, because my son is like he's buried alive.
I know she really cried for her son.
But she knows where he is.
My son, I don't know where he is.
I don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured.
I don't know what happened to him.
So that's why I decided to tell my story, so that my suffering is something positive for other women.
For all the women, all the mothers that give life, you can give back, you can change.
It's up to us women, because we are women, because we love our children.
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together.
It's not against women, it's for us, for us women, for our children.
I talk against violence, against terrorism.
I go to schools to talk to young, Muslim girls so they don't accept to be married against their will very young.
So if I can save one of the young girls, and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did, well this is something good.
This is why I'm here in front of you.
PR: I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha, starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members -- which was a very private meeting with security, because it was November 2002, and, frankly, we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country -- those of us family members.
But we were all so nervous.
"Why does she want to meet us?"
And then she was nervous.
"Why did we want to meet her?"
What did we want from each other?
Before we knew each others' names, or anything, we had embraced and wept.
Then we sat in a circle with support, with help, from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation.
And Aicha started, and she said, "I don't know if my son is guilty or innocent, but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families.
I know what it is to suffer, and I feel that if there is a crime, a person should be tried fairly and punished."
But she reached out to us in that way, and it was, I'd like to say, it was an ice-breaker.
And what happened then is we all told our stories, and we all connected as human beings.
By the end of the afternoon -- it was about three hours after lunch -- we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever.
Now what I learned from her, is a woman, not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then, and what was being done to her son, but the life she's had.
I never had met someone with such a hard life, from such a totally different culture and environment from my own.
And I feel that we have a special connection, which I value very much.
And I think it's all about being afraid of the other, but making that step and then realizing, "Hey, this wasn't so hard.
Who else can I meet that I don't know, or that I'm so different from?"
So, Aicha, do you have a couple of words for conclusion?
Because our time is up.
AW: I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people, the other.
You have to be generous, and your hearts must be generous, your mind must be generous.
You must be tolerant.
You have to fight against violence.
And I hope that someday we'll all live together in peace and respecting each other.
This is what I wanted to say.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_pritchard_invents_a_water_filter.html</url>
Good morning everybody.
I'd like to talk about a couple of things today.
The first thing is water.
Now I see you've all been enjoying the water that's been provided for you here at the conference, over the past couple of days.
And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source.
But what if it wasn't?
What if it was from a source like this?
Then statistics would actually say that half of you would now be suffering with diarrhea.
I talked a lot in the past about statistics, and the provision of safe drinking water for all.
But they just don't seem to get through.
And I think I've worked out why.
It's because, using current thinking, the scale of the problem just seems too huge to contemplate solving.
So we just switch off: us, governments and aid agencies.
Well, today, I'd like to show you that through thinking differently, the problem has been solved.
By the way, since I've been speaking, another 13,000 people around the world are suffering now with diarrhea.
And four children have just died.
I invented Lifesaver bottle because I got angry.
I, like most of you, was sitting down, the day after Christmas in 2004, when I was watching the devastating news of the Asian tsunami as it rolled in, playing out on TV.
The days and weeks that followed, people fleeing to the hills, being forced to drink contaminated water or face death.
That really stuck with me.
Then, a few months later, Hurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America.
"Okay," I thought, "here's a First World country, let's see what they can do."
Day one: nothing.
Day two: nothing.
Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome?
People were shooting each other on the streets for TV sets and water.
That's when I decided I had to do something.
Now I spent a lot of time in my garage, over the next weeks and months, and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife.
However, after a few failed prototypes, I finally came up with this, the Lifesaver bottle.
Okay, now for the science bit.
Before Lifesaver, the best hand filters were only capable of filtering down to about 200 nanometers.
The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers.
So a 200-nanometer bacteria is going to get through a 200-nanometer hole.
The smallest virus, on the other hand, is about 25 nanometers.
So that's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes.
Lifesaver pores are 15 nanometers.
So nothing is getting through.
Okay, I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration.
Would you like to see that?
I spent all the time setting this up, so I guess I should.
We're in the fine city of Oxford.
So -- someone's done that up.
Fine city of Oxford, so what I've done is I've gone and got some water from the River Cherwell, and the River Thames, that flow through here. And this is the water.
But I got to thinking, you know, if we were in the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this.
So I've gone and got some stuff to add into it.
And this is from my pond.
Have a smell of that, mister cameraman.
Okay. Right.
We're just going to pour that in there.
Audience: Ugh!
Michael Pritchard: Okay. We've got some runoff from a sewage plant farm.
So I'm just going to put that in there.
Put that in there. There we go.
And some other bits and pieces, chuck that in there.
And I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit.
So we're just going to put that in there as well.
Okay. Now.
The Lifesaver bottle works really simply.
You just scoop the water up.
Today I'm going to use a jug just to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there.
That's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit.
Okay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water, and put it in here. Do you want a drink yet?
Okay. There we go.
Replace the top.
Give it a few pumps. Okay?
That's all that's necessary.
Now as soon as I pop the teat, sterile drinking water is going to come out.
There we go. Mind the electrics.
That is safe, sterile drinking water.
Cheers.
There you go Chris.
What's it taste of?
Delicious.
Michael Pritchard: Okay.
Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay?
Okay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world.
It'll last for 6,000 liters.
And when it's expired, using failsafe technology, the system will shut off, protecting the user.
Pop the cartridge out. Pop a new one in.
It's good for another 6,000 liters.
So let's look at the applications.
Traditionally, in a crisis, what do we do?
We ship water.
Then, after a few weeks, we set up camps.
And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water.
What happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp?
Diseases spread. More resources are required.
The problem just becomes self-perpetuating.
But by thinking differently, and shipping these, people can stay put.
They can make their own sterile drinking water, and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives.
Now, it doesn't require a natural disaster for this to work.
Using the old thinking, of national infrastructure and pipe work, is too expensive.
When you run the numbers on a calculator, you run out of noughts.
So here is the "thinking different" bit.
Instead of shipping water, and using man-made processes to do it, let's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system.
She picks the water up from there, desalinates it, for free, transports it over there, and dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.
And where do people live? Near water.
All we've go to do is make it sterile. How do we do that?
Well, we could use the Lifesaver bottle.
Or we could use one of these.
The same technology, in a jerry can.
This will process 25,000 liters of water; that's good enough for a family of four, for three years.
And how much does it cost?
About half a cent a day to run.
Thank you.
So, by thinking differently, and processing water at the point of use, mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day to collect their water.
They can get it from a source nearby.
So with just eight billion dollars, we can hit the millennium goal's target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water.
To put that into context, The U.K. government spends about 12 billion pounds a year on foreign aid.
But why stop there?
With 20 billion dollars, everyone can have access to safe drinking water.
So the three-and-a-half billion people that suffer every year as a result, and the two million kids that die every year, will live.
Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/paddy_ashdown_the_global_power_shift.html</url>
There's a poem written by a very famous English poet at the end of the 19th century.
It was said to echo in Churchill's brain in the 1930s.
And the poem goes: "On the idle hill of summer, lazy with the flow of streams, hark I hear a distant drummer, drumming like a sound in dreams, far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by, dear to friend and food to powder, soldiers marching, soon to die."
Those who are interested in poetry, the poem is "A Shropshire Lad" written by A.E. Housman.
But what Housman understood, and you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too, was that the long, hot, silvan summers of stability of the 19th century were coming to a close, and that we were about to move into one of those terrifying periods of history when power changes.
And these are always periods, ladies and gentlemen, accompanied by turbulence, and all too often by blood.
And my message for you is that I believe we are condemned, if you like, to live at just one of those moments in history when the gimbals upon which the established order of power is beginning to change and the new look of the world, the new powers that exist in the world, are beginning to take form.
And these are -- and we see it very clearly today -- nearly always highly turbulent times, highly difficult times, and all too often very bloody times.
By the way, it happens about once every century.
You might argue that the last time it happened -- and that's what Housman felt coming and what Churchill felt too -- was that when power passed from the old nations, the old powers of Europe, across the Atlantic to the new emerging power of the United States of America -- the beginning of the American century.
And of course, into the vacuum where the too-old European powers used to be were played the two bloody catastrophes of the last century -- the one in the first part and the one in the second part: the two great World Wars.
Mao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars, and it's probably a more accurate way of describing them.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, we live at one of those times.
But for us, I want to talk about three factors today.
And the first of these, the first two of these, is about a shift in power.
And the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to, which has never quite happened in the way it's happening now.
But let's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world.
And what is happening today is, in one sense, frightening because it's never happened before.
We have seen lateral shifts of power -- the power of Greece passed to Rome and the power shifts that occurred during the European civilizations -- but we are seeing something slightly different.
For power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation.
It's also moving vertically.
What's happening today is that the power that was encased, held to accountability, held to the rule of law, within the institution of the nation state has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage.
The globalization of power -- we talk about the globalization of markets, but actually it's the globalization of real power.
And where, at the nation state level that power is held to accountability subject to the rule of law, on the international stage it is not.
The international stage and the global stage where power now resides: the power of the Internet, the power of the satellite broadcasters, the power of the money changers -- this vast money-go-round that circulates now 32 times the amount of money necessary for the trade it's supposed to be there to finance -- the money changers, if you like, the financial speculators that have brought us all to our knees quite recently, the power of the multinational corporations now developing budgets often bigger than medium-sized countries.
These live in a global space which is largely unregulated, not subject to the rule of law, and in which people may act free of constraint.
Now that suits the powerful up to a moment.
It's always suitable for those who have the most power to operate in spaces without constraint, but the lesson of history is that, sooner or later, unregulated space -- space not subject to the rule of law -- becomes populated, not just by the things you wanted -- international trade, the Internet, etc. -- but also by the things you don't want -- international criminality, international terrorism.
The revelation of 9/11 is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth, nevertheless, those who inhabit that space can attack you even in your most iconic of cities one bright September morning.
It's said that something like 60 percent of the four million dollars that was taken to fund 9/11 actually passed through the institutions of the Twin Towers which 9/11 destroyed.
You see, our enemies also use this space -- the space of mass travel, the Internet, satellite broadcasters -- to be able to get around their poison, which is about destroying our systems and our ways.
Sooner or later, sooner or later, the rule of history is that where power goes governance must follow.
And if it is therefore the case, as I believe it is, that one of the phenomenon of our time is the globalization of power, then it follows that one of the challenges of our time is to bring governance to the global space.
And I believe that the decades ahead of us now will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent the more or less we are able to achieve that aim: to bring governance to the global space.
Now notice, I'm not talking about government.
I'm not talking about setting up some global democratic institution.
My own view, by the way, ladies and gentlemen, is that this is unlikely to be done by spawning more U.N. institutions.
If we didn't have the U.N., we'd have to invent it.
The world needs an international forum.
It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action.
But when it comes to governance of the global space, my guess is this won't happen through the creation of more U.N. institutions.
It will actually happen by the powerful coming together and making treaty-based systems, treaty-based agreements, to govern that global space.
And if you look, you can see them happening, already beginning to emerge.
The World Trade Organization: treaty-based organization, entirely treaty-based, and yet, powerful enough to hold even the most powerful, the United States, to account if necessary.
Kyoto: the beginnings of struggling to create a treaty-based organization.
The G20: we know now that we have to put together an institution which is capable of bringing governance to that financial space for financial speculation.
And that's what the G20 is, a treaty-based institution.
Now there's a problem there, and we'll come back to it in a minute, which is that if you bring the most powerful together to make the rules in treaty-based institutions, to fill that governance space, then what happens to the weak who are left out?
And that's a big problem, and we'll return to it in just a second.
So there's my first message, that if you are to pass through these turbulent times more or less turbulently, then our success in doing that will in large measure depend on our capacity to bring sensible governance to the global space.
And watch that beginning to happen.
My second point is, and I know I don't have to talk to an audience like this about such a thing, but power is not just shifting vertically, it's also shifting horizontally.
You might argue that the story, the history of civilizations, has been civilizations gathered around seas -- with the first ones around the Mediterranean, the more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic.
Well it seems to me that we're now seeing a fundamental shift of power, broadly speaking, away from nations gathered around the Atlantic [seaboard] to the nations gathered around the Pacific rim.
Now that begins with economic power, but that's the way it always begins.
You already begin to see the development of foreign policies, the augmentation of military budgets occurring in the other growing powers in the world.
I think actually this is not so much a shift from the West to the East; something different is happening.
My guess is, for what it's worth, is that the United States will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next 10 years, 15, but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered; it has radically changed.
We are coming out of 50 years, most unusual years, of history in which we have had a totally mono-polar world, in which every compass needle for or against has to be referenced by its position to Washington -- a world bestrode by a single colossus.
But that's not a usual case in history.
In fact, what's now emerging is the much more normal case of history.
You're beginning to see the emergence of a multi-polar world.
Up until now, the United States has been the dominant feature of our world.
They will remain the most powerful nation, but they will be the most powerful nation in an increasingly multi-polar world.
And you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up -- in China, of course, though my own guess is that China's ascent to greatness is not smooth.
It's going to be quite grumpy as China begins to democratize her society after liberalizing her economy.
But that's a subject of a different discussion.
You see India, you see Brazil.
You see increasingly that the world now looks actually, for us Europeans, much more like Europe in the 19th century.
Europe in the 19th century: a great British foreign secretary, Lord Canning, used to describe it as the "European concert of powers."
There was a balance, a five-sided balance.
Britain always played to the balance.
If Paris got together with Berlin, Britain got together with Vienna and Rome to provide a counterbalance.
Now notice, in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world, you have fixed alliances -- NATO, the Warsaw Pact.
A fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances.
But a multiple polarity of power means shifting and changing alliances.
And that's the world we're coming into, in which we will increasingly see that our alliances are not fixed.
Canning, the great British foreign secretary once said, "Britain has a common interest, but no common allies."
And we will see increasingly that even we in the West will reach out, have to reach out, beyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers to make alliances with others if we want to get things done in the world.
Note, that when we went into Libya, it was not good enough for the West to do it alone; we had to bring others in.
We had to bring, in this case, the Arab League in.
My guess is Iraq and Afghanistan are the last times when the West has tried to do it themselves, and we haven't succeeded.
My guess is that we're reaching the beginning of the end of 400 years -- I say 400 years because it's the end of the Ottoman Empire -- of the hegemony of Western power, Western institutions and Western values.
You know, up until now, if the West got its act together, it could propose and dispose in every corner of the world.
But that's no longer true.
Take the last financial crisis after the Second World War.
The West got together -- the Bretton Woods Institution, World Bank, International Monetary Fund -- the problem solved.
Now we have to call in others.
Now we have to create the G20.
Now we have to reach beyond the cozy circle of our Western friends.
Let me make a prediction for you, which is probably even more startling.
I suspect we are now reaching the end of 400 years when Western power was enough.
People say to me, "The Chinese, of course, they'll never get themselves involved in peace-making, multilateral peace-making around the world."
Oh yes? Why not?
How many Chinese troops are serving under the blue beret, serving under the blue flag, serving under the U.N. command in the world today?
3,700.
How many Americans? 11.
What is the largest naval contingent tackling the issue of Somali pirates?
The Chinese naval contingent.
Of course they are, they are a mercantilist nation.
They want to keep the sea lanes open.
Increasingly, we are going to have to do business with people with whom we do not share values, but with whom, for the moment, we share common interests.
It's a whole new different way of looking at the world that is now emerging.
And here's the third factor, which is totally different.
Today in our modern world, because of the Internet, because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here, everything is connected to everything.
We are now interdependent.
We are now interlocked, as nations, as individuals, in a way which has never been the case before, never been the case before.
The interrelationship of nations, well it's always existed.
Diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations.
But now we are intimately locked together.
You get swine flu in Mexico, it's a problem for Charles de Gaulle Airport 24 hours later.
Lehman Brothers goes down, the whole lot collapses.
There are fires in the steppes of Russia, food riots in Africa.
We are all now deeply, deeply, deeply interconnected.
And what that means is the idea of a nation state acting alone, not connected with others, not working with others, is no longer a viable proposition.
Because the actions of a nation state are neither confined to itself, nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself to control its own territory, because the effects outside the nation state are now beginning to affect what happens inside them.
I was a young soldier in the last of the small empire wars of Britain.
At that time, the defense of my country was about one thing and one thing only: how strong was our army, how strong was our air force, how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies.
That was when the enemy was outside the walls.
Now the enemy is inside the walls.
Now if I want to talk about the defense of my country, I have to speak to the Minister of Health because pandemic disease is a threat to my security, I have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture because food security is a threat to my security, I have to speak to the Minister of Industry because the fragility of our hi-tech infrastructure is now a point of attack for our enemies -- as we see from cyber warfare -- I have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs because who has entered my country, who lives in that terraced house in that inner city has a direct effect on what happens in my country -- as we in London saw in the 7/7 bombings.
It's no longer the case that the security of a country is simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense.
It's its capacity to lock together its institutions.
And this tells you something very important.
It tells you that, in fact, our governments, vertically constructed, constructed on the economic model of the Industrial Revolution -- vertical hierarchy, specialization of tasks, command structures -- have got the wrong structures completely.
You in business know that the paradigm structure of our time, ladies and gentlemen, is the network.
It's your capacity to network that matters, both within your governments and externally.
So here is Ashdown's third law.
By the way, don't ask me about Ashdown's first law and second law because I haven't invented those yet; it always sounds better if there's a third law, doesn't it?
Ashdown's third law is that in the modern age, where everything is connected to everything, the most important thing about what you can do is what you can do with others.
The most important bit about your structure -- whether you're a government, whether you're an army regiment, whether you're a business -- is your docking points, your interconnectors, your capacity to network with others.
You understand that in industry; governments don't.
But now one final thing.
If it is the case, ladies and gentlemen -- and it is -- that we are now locked together in a way that has never been quite the same before, then it's also the case that we share a destiny with each other.
Suddenly and for the very first time, collective defense, the thing that has dominated us as the concept of securing our nations, is no longer enough.
It used to be the case that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe, I was safe; if my country was more powerful than their country, I was safe; my alliance, like NATO, was more powerful than their alliance, I was safe.
It is no longer the case.
The advent of the interconnectedness and of the weapons of mass destruction means that, increasingly, I share a destiny with my enemy.
When I was a diplomat negotiating the disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union in Geneva in the 1970s, we succeeded because we understood we shared a destiny with them.
Collective security is not enough.
Peace has come to Northern Ireland because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work.
They shared a destiny with their enemies.
One of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East is that both sides, both Israel and, I think, the Palestinians, do not understand that they share a collective destiny.
And so suddenly, ladies and gentlemen, what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages becomes something we have to take seriously as a matter of public policy.
I started with a poem, I'll end with one.
The great poem of John Donne's.
"Send not for whom the bell tolls."
The poem is called "No Man is an Island."
And it goes: "Every man's death affected me, for I am involved in mankind, send not to ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee."
For John Donne, a recommendation of morality.
For us, I think, part of the equation for our survival.
Thank you very much.

<title>Paddy Ashdown: The global power shift</title>
<description>Paddy Ashdown claims that we are living in a moment in history where power is changing in ways it never has before. In a spellbinding talk he outlines the three major global shifts that he sees coming. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_buettner_how_to_live_to_be_100.html</url>
Something called the Danish Twin Study established that only about 10 percent of how long the average person lives, within certain biological limits, is dictated by our genes.
The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle.
So the premise of Blue Zones: if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a de facto formula for longevity.
But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula of longevity is, they probably couldn't tell you.
They've probably heard of the South Beach Diet, or the Atkins Diet.
You have the USDA food pyramid.
There is what Oprah tells us.
There is what Doctor Oz tells us.
The fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion around what really helps us live longer better.
Should you be running marathons or doing yoga?
Should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu?
When it comes to supplements, should you be taking them?
How about these hormones or resveratrol?
And does purpose play into it?
Spirituality? And how about how we socialize?
Well, our approach to finding longevity was to team up with National Geographic, and the National Institute on Aging, to find the four demographically confirmed areas that are geographically defined.
And then bring a team of experts in there to methodically go through exactly what these people do, to distill down the cross-cultural distillation.
And at the end of this I'm going to tell you what that distillation is.
But first I'd like to debunk some common myths when it comes to longevity.
And the first myth is if you try really hard you can live to be 100.
False.
The problem is, only about one out of 5,000 people in America live to be 100.
Your chances are very low.
Even though it's the fastest growing demographic in America, it's hard to reach 100.
The problem is that we're not programmed for longevity.
We are programmed for something called procreative success.
I love that word.
It reminds me of my college days.
Biologists term procreative success to mean the age where you have children and then another generation, the age when your children have children.
After that the effect of evolution completely dissipates.
If you're a mammal, if you're a rat or an elephant, or a human, in between, it's the same story.
So to make it to age 100, you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle, you also have to have won the genetic lottery.
The second myth is, there are treatments that can help slow, reverse, or even stop aging.
False.
When you think of it, there is 99 things that can age us.
Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes, those brain cells die, they never come back.
Play tennis too hard, on your knees, ruin your cartilage, the cartilage never comes back.
Our arteries can clog. Our brains can gunk up with plaque, and we can get Alzheimer's.
There is just too many things to go wrong.
Our bodies have 35 trillion cells, trillion with a "T." We're talking national debt numbers here.
Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years.
And every time they turn themselves over there is some damage. And that damage builds up.
And it builds up exponentially.
It's a little bit like the days when we all had Beatles albums or Eagles albums and we'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape, and let our friends copy that cassette tape, and pretty soon, with successive generations that tape sounds like garbage.
Well, the same things happen to our cells.
That's why a 65-year-old person is aging at a rate of about 125 times faster than a 12-year-old person.
So, if there is nothing you can do to slow your aging or stop your aging, what am I doing here?
Well, the fact of the matter is the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body, my body, your body, is about 90 years, a little bit more for women.
But life expectancy in this country is only 78.
So somewhere along the line, we're leaving about 12 good years on the table.
These are years that we could get.
And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease, heart disease, cancer and diabetes.
We think the best way to get these missing years is to look at the cultures around the world that are actually experiencing them, areas where people are living to age 100 at rates up to 10 times greater than we are, areas where the life expectancy is an extra dozen years, the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction of what it is in this country.
We found our first Blue Zone about 125 miles off the coast of Italy, on the island of Sardinia.
And not the entire island, the island is about 1.4 million people, but only up in the highlands, an area called the Nuoro province.
And here we have this area where men live the longest, about 10 times more centenarians than we have here in America.
And this is a place where people not only reach age 100, they do so with extraordinary vigor.
Places where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work, chop wood, and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them.
Their history actually goes back to about the time of Christ.
It's actually a Bronze Age culture that's been isolated.
Because the land is so infertile, they largely are shepherds, which occasions regular, low-intensity physical activity.
Their diet is mostly plant-based, accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields.
They came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called carta musica made out of durum wheat, a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals so the cheese is high in Omega-3 fatty acids instead of Omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals, and a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world.
It's called Cannonau.
But the real secret I think lies more in the way that they organize their society.
And one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society is how they treat older people.
You ever notice here in America, social equity seems to peak at about age 24?
Just look at the advertisements.
Here in Sardinia, the older you get the more equity you have, the more wisdom you're celebrated for.
You go into the bars in Sardinia, instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar, you see the centenarian of the month calendar.
This, as it turns out, is not only good for your aging parents to keep them close to the family -- it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy -- research shows it's also good for the children of those families, who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease.
That's called the grandmother effect.
We found our second Blue Zone on the other side of the planet, about 800 miles south of Tokyo, on the archipelago of Okinawa.
Okinawa is actually 161 small islands.
And in the northern part of the main island, this is ground zero for world longevity.
This is a place where the oldest living female population is found.
It's a place where people have the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world.
They have what we want.
