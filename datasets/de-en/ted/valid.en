We'd also made cricket the only sport in India, which is a pity, but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big, which is a bit of a tragedy of our times.
Now, this last minute before I go -- there's a couple of side effects of all this.
For a long time, India was this country of poverty, dust, beggars, snake charmers, filth, Delhi belly -- people heard Delhi belly stories before they came.
And, all of a sudden, India was this land of opportunity.
Cricketers all over the world said, "You know, we love India. We love to play in India."
And that felt good, you know?
We said, "The dollar's quite powerful actually."
Can you imagine, you've got the dollar on view and there's no Delhi belly in there anymore.
There's no filth, there's no beggars, all the snake charmers have vanished, everybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules.
Right so, finally, an English game that India usurped a little bit, but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world.
If you want to take the game around the world, it's got to be the shortest form of the game.
You can't take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end, or you can't take it all over the world.
So that's what T20 is doing.
Hopefully, it'll make everyone richer, hopefully it'll make the game bigger and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

We all make decisions every day; we want to know what the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic.
And surely, if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times, that would be a tremendous gift.
It turns out that, in fact, the world was given this gift in 1738 by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli.
And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is, and I also want to explain to you why it is that it hasn't made a damn bit of difference.
Now, this is Bernoulli's gift. This is a direct quote.
And if it looks like Greek to you, it's because, well, it's Greek.
But the simple English translation -- much less precise, but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say -- was this: The expected value of any of our actions -- that is, the goodness that we can count on getting -- is the product of two simple things: the odds that this action will allow us to gain something, and the value of that gain to us.
In a sense, what Bernoulli was saying is, if we can estimate and multiply these two things, we will always know precisely how we should behave.
Now, this simple equation, even for those of you who don't like equations, is something that you're quite used to.
Here's an example: if I were to tell you, let's play a little coin toss game, and I'm going to flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars, but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me, most of you would say, sure, I'll take that bet. Because you know that the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars, that multiplies to five, and that's more than I'm charging you to play. So, the answer is, yes.
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet.
Now, the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses, but in fact, it's not very simple in everyday life.
People are horrible at estimating both of these things, and that's what I want to talk to you about today.
There are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do, and those are errors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed, and errors in estimating the value of their own success.
Now, let me talk about the first one first.
Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy: there are six sides to a die, two sides to a coin, 52 cards in a deck.
You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads.
But as it turns out, this is not a very easy idea to apply in everyday life. That's why Americans spend more -- I should say, lose more -- gambling than on all other forms of entertainment combined.
The reason is, this isn't how people do odds.
The way people figure odds requires that we first talk a bit about pigs.
Now, the question I'm going to put to you is whether you think there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed in any particular day in Oxford.
And of course, you all know that the answer is dogs.
And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you've seen dogs and pigs on leashes.
It was very easy to remember seeing dogs, not so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind, then dogs on leashes are more probable.
That's not a bad rule of thumb, except when it is.
So, for example, here's a word puzzle.
Are there more four-letter English words with R in the third place or R in the first place?
Well, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan, and it's awfully easy to say to yourself, Ring, Rang, Rung, and very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly.
But in fact, there are many more words in the English language with R in the third than the first place.
The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind isn't because they're improbable, unlikely or infrequent.
It's because the mind recalls words by their first letter.
You kind of shout out the sound, S -- and the word comes.
It's like the dictionary; it's hard to look things up by the third letter.
So, this is an example of how this idea that the quickness with which things come to mind can give you a sense of their probability -- how this idea could lead you astray. It's not just puzzles, though.
For example, when Americans are asked to estimate the odds that they will die in a variety of interesting ways -- these are estimates of number of deaths per year per 200 million U.S. citizens.
And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked to guess how many people die from tornado, fireworks, asthma, drowning, etc.
Compare these to the actual numbers.
Now, you see a very interesting pattern here, which is first of all, two things are vastly over-estimated, namely tornadoes and fireworks.
Two things are vastly underestimated: dying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why?
When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper and the headline was, "Boy dies of Asthma?"
It's not interesting because it's so common.
It's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances of news stories or newsreels where we've seen tornadoes devastating cities, or some poor schmuck who's blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July.
Drownings and asthma deaths don't get much coverage.
They don't come quickly to mind, and as a result, we vastly underestimate them.
Indeed, this is kind of like the Sesame Street game of "Which thing doesn't belong?" And you're right to say it's the swimming pool that doesn't belong, because the swimming pool is the only thing on this slide that's actually very dangerous.
The way that more of you are likely to die than the combination of all three of the others that you see on the slide.
The lottery is an excellent example, of course -- an excellent test-case of people's ability to compute probabilities.
And economists -- forgive me, for those of you who play the lottery -- but economists, at least among themselves, refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax, because the odds of getting any payoff by investing your money in a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushing the money directly down the toilet -- which, by the way, doesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything.
Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery?
Well, there are many answers, but one answer surely is, we see a lot of winners. Right? When this couple wins the lottery, or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check -- how the hell do you cash things that size, I don't know.
We see this on TV; we read about it in the paper.
When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost?
Indeed, if we required that television stations run a 30-second interview with each loser every time they interview a winner, the 100 million losers in the last lottery would require nine-and-a-half years of your undivided attention just to watch them say, "Me? I lost." "Me? I lost."
Now, if you watch nine-and-a-half years of television -- no sleep, no potty breaks -- and you saw loss after loss after loss, and then at the end there's 30 seconds of, "and I won," the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small.
Look, I can prove this to you: here's a little lottery.
There's 10 tickets in this lottery.
Nine of them have been sold to these individuals.
It costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and, if you win, you get 20 bucks. Is this a good bet?
Well, Bernoulli tells us it is.
The expected value of this lottery is two dollars; this is a lottery in which you should invest your money.
And most people say, "OK, I'll play."
Now, a slightly different version of this lottery: imagine that the nine tickets are all owned by one fat guy named Leroy.
Leroy has nine tickets; there's one left.
Do you want it? Most people won't play this lottery.
Now, you can see the odds of winning haven't changed, but it's now fantastically easy to imagine who's going to win.
It's easy to see Leroy getting the check, right?
You can't say to yourself, "I'm as likely to win as anybody," because you're not as likely to win as Leroy.
The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy changes your decision to play, even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds.
Now, estimating odds, as difficult as it may seem, is a piece of cake compared to trying to estimate value: trying to say what something is worth, how much we'll enjoy it, how much pleasure it will give us.
I want to talk now about errors in value.
How much is this Big Mac worth? Is it worth 25 dollars?
Most of you have the intuition that it's not -- you wouldn't pay that for it.
But in fact, to decide whether a Big Mac is worth 25 dollars requires that you ask one, and only one question, which is: What else can I do with 25 dollars?
If you've ever gotten on one of those long-haul flights to Australia and realized that they're not going to serve you any food, but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened the McDonald's bag, and the smell of golden arches is wafting over the seat, you think, I can't do anything else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours.
I can't even set it on fire -- they took my cigarette lighter!
Suddenly, 25 dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal.
On the other hand, if you're visiting an underdeveloped country, and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal, it's exorbitant for a Big Mac.
Why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no, before I'd even told you anything about the context?
Because most of you compared the price of this Big Mac to the price you're used to paying. Rather than asking, "What else can I do with my money," comparing this investment to other possible investments, you compared to the past.
And this is a systematic error people make.
What you knew is, you paid three dollars in the past; 25 is outrageous.
This is an error, and I can prove it to you by showing the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads.
For example, this is, of course, one of the most delicious tricks in marketing, is to say something used to be higher, and suddenly it seems like a very good deal.
When people are asked about these two different jobs: a job where you make 60K, then 50K, then 40K, a job where you're getting a salary cut each year, and one in which you're getting a salary increase, people like the second job better than the first, despite the fact they're all told they make much less money. Why?
Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages, even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period. Here's another nice example.
Here's a $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package; it's now on sale for 1,600.
Assuming you wanted to go to Hawaii, would you buy this package?
Most people say they would. Here's a slightly different story: $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars, so you decide to mull it over for a week.
By the time you get to the ticket agency, the best fares are gone -- the package now costs 1,500. Would you buy it? Most people say, no.
Why? Because it used to cost 700, and there's no way I'm paying 1,500 for something that was 700 last week.
This tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words, a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal.
Here's another example of how comparing to the past can befuddle our decisions.
Imagine that you're going to the theater.
You're on your way to the theater.
In your wallet you have a ticket, for which you paid 20 dollars.
You also have a 20-dollar bill.
When you arrive at the theater, you discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket.
Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it?
Most people answer, no.
Now, let's just change one thing in this scenario.
You're on your way to the theater, and in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills.
When you arrive you discover you've lost one of them.
Would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket?
Well, of course, I went to the theater to see the play.
What does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do?
Now, just in case you're not getting it, here's a schematic of what happened, OK?
Along the way, you lost something.
In both cases, it was a piece of paper.
In one case, it had a U.S. president on it; in the other case it didn't.
What the hell difference should it make?
The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself, I'm not paying twice for the same thing.
You compare the cost of the play now -- 40 dollars -- to the cost that it used to have -- 20 dollars -- and you say it's a bad deal.
Comparing with the past causes many of the problems that behavioral economists and psychologists identify in people's attempts to assign value.
But even when we compare with the possible, instead of the past, we still make certain kinds of mistakes.
And I'm going to show you one or two of them.
One of the things we know about comparison: that when we compare one thing to the other, it changes its value.
So in 1992, this fellow, George Bush, for those of us who were kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum, didn't seem like such a great guy.
Suddenly, we're almost longing for him to return.
The comparison changes how we evaluate him.
Now, retailers knew this long before anybody else did, of course, and they use this wisdom to help you -- spare you the undue burden of money.
And so a retailer, if you were to go into a wine shop and you had to buy a bottle of wine, and you see them here for eight, 27 and 33 dollars, what would you do?
Most people don't want the most expensive, they don't want the least expensive.
So, they will opt for the item in the middle.
If you're a smart retailer, then, you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf, because suddenly the $33 wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison.
So I'm telling you something you already knew: namely, that comparison changes the value of things.
Here's why that's a problem: the problem is that when you get that $33 bottle of wine home, it won't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to.
The comparisons we make when we are appraising value, where we're trying to estimate how much we'll like things, are not the same comparisons we'll be making when we consume them.
This problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil our attempts to make rational decisions.
Let me just give you an example.
I have to show you something from my own lab, so let me sneak this in.
These are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions: How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now?
They're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them.
For some of the subjects, sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of Godiva chocolates, and for others is a can of Spam.
In fact, these items that are sitting in the room change how much the subjects think they're going to enjoy the potato chips.
Namely, those who are looking at Spam think potato chips are going to be quite tasty; those who are looking at Godiva chocolate think they won't be nearly so tasty.
Of course, what happens when they eat the potato chips?
Well, look, you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful of greasy, salty, crispy, delicious snacks, what's sitting in the corner of the room makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience.
Nonetheless, their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience.
You've all experienced this yourself, even if you've never come into our lab to eat potato chips. So here's a question: You want to buy a car stereo.
The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars, but if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks.
So would you drive to get 50 percent off, saving 100 dollars?
Most people say they would.
They can't imagine buying it for twice the price when, with one trip across town, they can get it for half off.
Now, let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo, and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000.
But if you drove across town, you could get it for 30,900.
Would you drive to get it? At this point, 0.003 savings -- the 100 dollars.
Most people say, no, I'm going to schlep across town to save 100 bucks on the purchase of a car?
This kind of thinking drives economists crazy, and it should.
Because this 100 dollars that you save -- hello! -- doesn't know where it came from.
It doesn't know what you saved it on.
When you go to buy groceries with it, it doesn't go, I'm the money saved on the car stereo, or, I'm the dumb money saved on the car. It's money.
And if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks, it's worth 100 bucks no matter what you're saving it on. People don't think that way.
That's why they don't know whether their mutual fund manager is taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment, but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste.
Now, you can see, this is the problem of shifting comparisons, because what you're doing is, you're comparing the 100 bucks to the purchase that you're making, but when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison.
You've all had this experience.
If you're an American, for example, you've probably traveled in France.
And at some point you may have met a couple from your own hometown, and you thought, "Oh, my God, these people are so warm. They're so nice to me.
I mean, compared to all these people who hate me when I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don't, these people are just wonderful." And so you tour France with them, and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner, and what do you find?
Compared to your regular friends, they are boring and dull, right? Because in this new context, the comparison is very, very different. In fact, you find yourself disliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship.
Now, you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo.
You go to the stereo store, you see two sets of speakers -- these big, boxy, monoliths, and these little, sleek speakers, and you play them, and you go, you know, I do hear a difference: the big ones sound a little better.
And so you buy them, and you bring them home, and you entirely violate the décor of your house.
And the problem, of course, is that this comparison you made in the store is a comparison you'll never make again.
What are the odds that years later you'll turn on the stereo and go, "Sounds so much better than those little ones," which you can't even remember hearing.
The problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult when these choices are arrayed over time.
People have a lot of trouble making decisions about things that will happen at different points in time.
And what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered is that by and large people use two simple rules.
So let me give you one very easy problem, a second very easy problem and then a third, hard, problem.
Here's the first easy problem: You can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now. Which would you prefer?
This is what we call a one-item IQ test, OK?
All of us, I hope, prefer more money, and the reason is, we believe more is better than less.
Here's the second problem: You can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month. Which would you prefer?
Again, an easy decision, because we all know that now is better than later.
What's hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict.
For example, when you're offered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars in a month.
This typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain by waiting, but you have to be patient.
What do we know? What do people do in these kinds of situations?
Well, by and large people are enormously impatient.
That is, they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars.
Maybe that isn't so remarkable, but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing Imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that's 12 months -- or 60 dollars in 13 months.
What do we find now?
People are gladly willing to wait: as long as they're waiting 12, they might as well wait 13.
What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen?
Comparison. Troubling comparison. Let me show you.
This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested you would show if I gave you time to respond, which is, people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher than the subjective value of 60 when they'll be delivered in now or one month, respectively -- a 30-day delay -- but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision off into the future a year.
Now, why in the world do you get this pattern of results?
These guys can tell us.
What you see here are two lads, one of them larger than the other: the fireman and the fiddler.
They are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon, and I want you to notice two things.
At no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No point.
However, the difference between them seems to be getting smaller.
First it's an inch in your view, then it's a quarter-inch, then a half-inch, and then finally they go off the edge of the earth.
Here are the results of what I just showed you.
This is the subjective height -- the height you saw of these guys at various points.
And I want you to see that two things are true.
One, the farther away they are, the smaller they look; and two, the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler.
But watch what happens when we make some of them disappear. Right.
At a very close distance, the fiddler looks taller than the fireman, but at a far distance their normal, their true, relations are preserved.
As Plato said, what space is to size, time is to value.
These are the results of the hard problem I gave you: 60 now or 50 in a month?
And these are subjective values, and what you can see is, our two rules are preserved.
People always think more is better than less: 60 is always better than 50, and they always think now is better than later: the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side.
Watch what happens when we drop some out.
Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us.
We have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now over waiting a month, but not if that decision is far in the future.
Notice something interesting that this implies -- namely, that when people get to the future, they will change their minds.
That is, as that month 12 approaches, you will say, what was I thinking, waiting an extra month for 60 dollars?
I'll take the 50 dollars now.
Well, the question with which I'd like to end is this: If we're so damn stupid, how did we get to the moon?
Because I could go on for about two hours with evidence of people's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value.
The answer to this question, I think, is an answer you've already heard in some of the talks, and I dare say you will hear again: namely, that our brains were evolved for a very different world than the one in which we are living.
They were evolved for a world in which people lived in very small groups, rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves, had rather short lives in which there were few choices and the highest priority was to eat and mate today.
Bernoulli's gift, Bernoulli's little formula, allows us, it tells us how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us.
That explains why we are so bad at using it, but it also explains why it is so terribly important that we become good, fast.
We are the only species on this planet that has ever held its own fate in its hands.
We have no significant predators, we're the masters of our physical environment; the things that normally cause species to become extinct are no longer any threat to us.
The only thing -- the only thing -- that can destroy us and doom us are our own decisions.
If we're not here in 10,000 years, it's going to be because we could not take advantage of the gift given to us by a young Dutch fellow in 1738, because we underestimated the odds of our future pains and overestimated the value of our present pleasures.
Thank you.
That was remarkable.
We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert. One and two.
Bill Lyell: Would you say that this mechanism is in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us, and is there some way that we could counteract that?
Dan Gilbert: I actually was consulting recently with the Department of Homeland Security, which generally believes that American security dollars should go to making borders safer.
I tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name based on people's psychological reaction to a set of events, and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified, rather than -- not rather than, but in addition to stopping the atrocities that we're all concerned about.
Surely the kinds of play that at least American media give to -- and forgive me, but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents.
We already know, for example, in the United States, more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes -- because they were scared -- and driving on highways, than were killed in 9/11. OK?
If I told you that there was a plague that was going to kill 15,000 Americans next year, you might be alarmed if you didn't find out it was the flu.
These are small-scale accidents, and we should be wondering whether they should get the kind of play, the kind of coverage, that they do.
Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they'll be hurt in these various ways, and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us.
Dan, I'd like to hear more on this. So, you're saying that our response to terror is, I mean, it's a form of mental bug?
Talk more about it.
DG: It's out-sized. I mean, look.
If Australia disappears tomorrow, terror is probably the right response.
That's an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand, when a bus blows up and 30 people are killed, more people than that were killed by not using their seatbelts in the same country.
Is terror the right response?
What causes the bug? Is it the drama of the event -- that it's so spectacular?
Is it the fact that it's an intentional attack by, quote, outsiders?
What is it?
DG: Yes. It's a number of things, and you hit on several of them.
First, it's a human agent trying to kill us -- it's not a tree falling on us by accident.
Second, these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again.
People are being killed for no reason instead of good reason -- as if there's good reason, but sometimes people think there are.
So there are a number of things that together make this seem like a fantastic event, but let's not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media, who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can.
I mean, what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it?
DG: Well, go to Israel. You know, go to Israel. And a mall blows up, and then everybody's unhappy about it, and an hour-and-a-half later -- at least when I was there, and I was 150 feet from the mall when it blew up -- I went back to my hotel and the wedding that was planned was still going on.
And as the Israeli mother said, she said, "We never let them win by stopping weddings."
I mean, this is a society that has learned -- and there are others too -- that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it, shall I say, as those of us who have not had many terror attacks.
But is there a rational fear that actually, the reason we're frightened about this is because we think that the Big One is to come?
DG: Yes, of course. So, if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be, there might be more and more buses of 30 people -- we would probably not be nearly so frightened.
I don't want to say -- please, I'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying, "Terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed."
That's not my point at all.
What I'm saying is that, surely, rationally, our distress about things that happen, about threats, should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come.
I think in the case of terrorism, it isn't.
And many of the things we've heard about from our speakers today -- how many people do you know got up and said, Poverty! I can't believe what poverty is doing to us.
People get up in the morning; they don't care about poverty.
It's not making headlines, it's not making news, it's not flashy.
There are no guns going off.
I mean, if you had to solve one of these problems, Chris, which would you solve? Terrorism or poverty?
That's a tough one.
There's no question.
Poverty, by an order of magnitude, a huge order of magnitude, unless someone can show that there's, you know, terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come.
The latest I've read, seen, thought is that it's incredibly hard for them to do that.
If that turns out to be wrong, we all look silly, but with poverty it's a bit -- DG: Even if that were true, still more people die from poverty.
We've evolved to get all excited about these dramatic attacks. Is that because in the past, in the ancient past, we just didn't understand things like disease and systems that cause poverty and so forth, and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy into worrying about those things?
People died; so be it.
But if you got attacked, that was something you could do something about.
And so we evolved these responses.
Is that what happened?
DG: Well, you know, the people who are most skeptical about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything are the evolutionary psychologists themselves.
My guess is that there's nothing quite that specific in our evolutionary past. But rather, if you're looking for an evolutionary explanation, you might say that most organisms are neo-phobic -- that is, they're a little scared of stuff that's new and different.
And there's a good reason to be, because old stuff didn't eat you. Right?
Any animal you see that you've seen before is less likely to be a predator than one that you've never seen before.
So, you know, when a school bus is blown up and we've never seen this before, our general tendency is to orient towards that which is new and novel is activated.
I don't think it's quite as specific a mechanism as the one you alluded to, but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it.
Jay Walker: You know, economists love to talk about the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect you're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of, which is the error of value.
I know, because I've interviewed about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years.
It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning.
That's what you think it is. All right?
The average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year, so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose, and yet she buys 150 tickets a year. Why is that?
It's not because she is stupid or he is stupid.
It's because the anticipation of possibly winning releases serotonin in the brain, and actually provides a good feeling until the drawing indicates you've lost.
Or, to put it another way, for the dollar investment, you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money down the toilet, which you cannot have a good feeling from.
Now, economists tend to -- -- economists tend to view the world through their own lenses, which is: this is just a bunch of stupid people.
And as a result, many people look at economists as stupid people.
And so fundamentally, the reason we got to the moon is, we didn't listen to the economists. Thank you very much.
DG: Well, no, it's a great point. It remains to be seen whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled by the amount of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember, people who didn't buy tickets don't feel awful the next day either, even though they don't feel great during the drawing.
I would disagree that people know they're not going to win.
I think they think it's unlikely, but it could happen, which is why they prefer that to the flushing.
But certainly I see your point: that there can be some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning.
Now, I think there's many good reasons not to listen to economists.
That isn't one of them, for me, but there's many others.
Last question.
Aubrey de Grey: My name's Aubrey de Grey, from Cambridge.
I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills -- I work on aging -- and I'm interested in doing something about it, as we'll all hear tomorrow.
I very much resonate with what you're saying, because it seems to me that the problem with getting people interested in doing anything about aging is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer or heart disease or whatever. Do you have any advice?
DG: For you or for them?
AdG: In persuading them.
DG: Ah, for you in persuading them.
Well, it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted.
But one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work is to get people to imagine the future more vividly.
One of the problems with making decisions about the far future and the near future is that we imagine the near future much more vividly than the far future.
To the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail that people put into the mental representations of near and far future, people begin to make decisions about the two in the same way.
So, would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you're 65 is a question that's very different than, imagine who you'll be when you're 65: will you be living, what will you look like, how much hair will you have, who will you be living with.
Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario, suddenly we feel like it might be important to save so that that guy has a little retirement money.
But these are tricks around the margins.
I think in general you're battling a very fundamental human tendency, which is to say, "I'm here today, and so now is more important than later."
Dan, thank you. Members of the audience, that was a fantastic session. Thank you.

'Theme and variations' is one of those forms that require a certain kind of intellectual activity, because you are always comparing the variation with the theme that you hold in your mind.
You might say that the theme is nature and everything that follows is a variation on the subject.
I was asked, I guess about six years ago, to do a series of paintings that in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca.
And it was very difficult for me to imagine how to paint pictures that were based on Piero until I realized that I could look at Piero as nature -- that I would have the same attitude towards looking at Piero della Francesca as I would if I were looking out a window at a tree.
And that was enormously liberating to me.
Perhaps it's not a very insightful observation, but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations based on a work by Piero, in this case that remarkable painting that's in the Uffizi, "The Duke of Montefeltro," who faces his consort, Battista.
Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject, I did the following series of drawings.
That's the real Piero della Francesca -- one of the greatest portraits in human history.
And these, I'll just show these without comment.
It's just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro, who's a great, great figure in the Renaissance, and probably the basis for Machiavelli's "The Prince."
He apparently lost an eye in battle, which is why he is always shown in profile.
And this is Battista.
And then I decided I could move them around a little bit -- so that for the first time in history, they're facing the same direction.
Whoops! Passed each other.
And then a visitor from another painting by Piero, this is from "The Resurrection of Christ" -- as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat.
And now, four large panels: this is upper left; upper right; lower left; lower right.
Incidentally, I've never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism.
Since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with there doesn't seem to be an argument there.
On another subject -- -- I was driving in the country one day with my wife, and I saw this sign, and I said, "That is a fabulous piece of design."
And she said, "What are you talking about?"
I said, "Well, it's so persuasive, because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage, and since most people are so suspicious of garages, and know that they're going to be ripped off, they use the word 'reliable.' But everybody says they're reliable.
But, reliable Dutchman" -- -- "Fantastic!"
Because as soon as you hear the word Dutchman -- which is an archaic word, nobody calls Dutch people "Dutchmen" anymore -- but as soon as you hear Dutchman, you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike, preventing the thing from falling and flooding Holland, and so on.
And so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of "Dutchman."
Now, if you think I'm exaggerating at all in this, all you have to do is substitute something else, like "Indonesian."
Or even "French."
Now, "Swiss" works, but you know it's going to cost a lot of money.
I'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster.
I do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts, where I teach, and the director of this school -- a remarkable man named Silas Rhodes -- often gives you a piece of text and he says, "Do something with this."
And so he did.
And this was the text -- "In words as fashion the same rule will hold/ Alike fantastic if too new or old/ Be not the first by whom the new are tried/ Nor yet the last to lay the old aside."
I could make nothing of that.
And I really struggled with this one.
And the first thing I did, which was sort of in the absence of another idea, was say I'll sort of write it out and make some words big, and I'll have some kind of design on the back somehow, and I was hoping -- as one often does -- to stumble into something.
So I took another crack at it -- you've got to keep it moving -- and I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and I pasted them down on an ugly board.
I thought that something would come out of it, like "Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope" because it's by Alexander Pope, but I sort of made a mess out of it, and then I thought I'd repeat it in some way so it was legible.
So, it was going nowhere.
Sometimes, in the middle of a resistant problem, I write down things that I know about it.
But you can see the beginning of an idea there, because you can see the word "new" emerging from the "old."
That's what happens.
There's a relationship between the old and the new; the new emerges from the context of the old.
And then I did some variations of it, but it still wasn't coalescing graphically at all.
I had this other version which had something interesting about it in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues.
The W was clearly a W, the N was clearly an N, even though they were very fragmentary and there wasn't a lot of information in it.
Then I got the words "new" and "old" and now I had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return.
I was really desperate at this point.
And so, I do something I'm truthfully ashamed of, which is that I took two drawings I had made for another purpose and I put them together.
It says "dreams" at the top.
And I was going to do a thing, I say, "Well, change the copy.
Let it say something about dreams, and come to SVA and you'll sort of fulfill your dreams."
But, to my credit, I was so embarrassed about doing that that I never submitted this sketch.
And, finally, I arrived at the following solution.
Now, it doesn't look terribly interesting, but it does have something that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters.
For one thing, it transgresses the idea of what a poster's supposed to be, which is to be understood and seen immediately, and not explained.
I remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts -- "If you have to explain it, it ain't working."
And one day I woke up and I said, "Well, suppose that's not true?"
So here's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left.
It says, "Thoughts: This poem is impossible.
Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations.
This one generates no imagery at all."
I am now exposing myself to my audience, right?
Which is something you never want to do professionally.
"Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening.
What's the heart of this poem?
Don't be trendy if you want to be serious.
Is doing the poster this way trendy in itself?
I guess one could reduce the idea further by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old, like this."
And then I show you a little drawing -- you see, you remember that old thing I discarded?
Well, I found a way to use it.
So, there's that little alternative over there, and I say, "Not bad," -- criticizing myself -- "but more didactic than visual.
Maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace, a kind of dance where each defines the other."
And then more self-questioning -- "Am I being simple-minded?
Is this the kind of simple that looks obvious, or the kind that looks profound?
There's a significant difference.
This could be embarrassing.
Actually, I realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition.
Do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school?"
Well, I think there are two fresh things here -- two fresh things.
One is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience, and not to suggest that I am confident about what I'm doing.
And as you know, you have to have a front.
I mean -- you've got to be confident; if you don't believe in your work, who else is going to believe in it?
So that's one thing, to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics.
That can be a big contribution.
The other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one; you get the big one and if you don't like that, how about the little one?
And that too is a relatively new idea.
And here's just a series of experiments where I ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square?
Now, this is a little illusion.
That poster is not folded.
It's not folded, that's a photograph Same cheap trick in the upper left-hand corner.
And here, a very peculiar poster because, simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer, it won't sit still in the space.
At times, it seems to be wider at the back than the front, and then it shifts.
And if you sit here long enough, it'll float off the page into the audience.
But, we don't have time.
And then an experiment -- a little bit about the nature of perspective, where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective, but the shape of the bottle -- which is identical to the outside shape -- is seen frontally.
And another piece for the art directors' club is "Anna Rees" casting long shadows.
This is another poster from the School of Visual Arts.
There were 10 artists invited to participate in it, and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and I didn't want to be embarrassed, so I worked very hard on this.
The idea was -- and it was a brilliant idea -- was to have 10 posters distributed throughout the city's subway system so every time you got on the subway you'd be passing a different poster, all of which had a different idea of what art is.
But I was absolutely stuck on the idea of "art is" and trying to determine what art was.
But then I gave up and I said, "Well, art is whatever."
And as soon as I said that, I discovered that the word "hat" was hidden in the word "whatever," and that led me to the inevitable conclusion.
But then again, it's on my list of didactic posters.
My intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster, in case you don't get it.
Now this says, "Note to the viewer: I thought I might use a visual cliche of our time -- Magritte's everyman -- to express the idea that art is mystery, continuity and history.
I'm also convinced that, in an age of computer manipulation, surrealism has become banal, a shadow of its former self.
The phrase 'Art is whatever' expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art-making -- a sort of 'it ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it' notion.
The shadow of Magritte falls across the central part of the poster a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word 'hat,' hidden in the word 'whatever.' The four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined: as a thing itself, the worth of the thing, the shadow of the thing, and the shape of the thing.
Whatever."
OK.
And the one that I did not submit, which I still like, I wanted to use the same phrase.
There were wonderful experiments by Bruno Munari on letterforms some years ago -- sort of, see how far you could go and still be able to read them.
And that idea stuck in my head.
But then I took the pieces that I had taken off and put them at the bottom.
And, of course those are the remains, and they're so labeled.
But what really happens is that you read it as: "Art is whatever remains."
Thank you.

<title>Milton Glaser: Using design to make ideas new</title>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/david_pizarro_the_strange_politics_of_disgust.html</url>
In the 17th century, a woman named Giulia Tofana had a very successful perfume business.
For over 50 years she ran it.
It sort of ended abruptly when she was executed — — for murdering 600 men. You see, it wasn't a very good perfume.
In fact, it was completely odorless and tasteless and colorless, but as a poison, it was the best money could buy, so women flocked to her in order to murder their husbands.
It turns out that poisoners were a valued and feared group, because poisoning a human being is a quite difficult thing.
The reason is, we have sort of a built-in poison detector.
You can see this as early as even in newborn infants.
If you are willing to do this, you can take a couple of drops of a bitter substance or a sour substance, and you'll see that face, the tongue stick out, the wrinkled nose, as if they're trying to get rid of what's in their mouth.
This reaction expands into adulthood and becomes sort of a full-blown disgust response, no longer just about whether or not we're about to be poisoned, but whenever there's a threat of physical contamination from some source. But the face remains strikingly similar.
It has expanded more, though, than just keeping us away from physical contaminants, and there's a growing body of evidence to suggest that, in fact, this emotion of disgust now influences our moral beliefs and even our deeply held political intuitions.
Why this might be the case?
We can understand this process by understanding a little bit about emotions in general. So the basic human emotions, those kinds of emotions that we share with all other human beings, exist because they motivate us to do good things and they keep us away from doing bad things.
So by and large, they are good for our survival.
Take the emotion of fear, for instance. It keeps us away from doing things that are really, really risky.
This photo taken just before his death — — is actually a — No, one reason this photo is interesting is because most people would not do this, and if they did, they would not live to tell it, because fear would have kicked in a long time ago to a natural predator.
Just like fear offers us protective benefits, disgust seems to do the same thing, except for what disgust does is keeps us away from not things that might eat us, or heights, but rather things that might poison us, or give us disease and make us sick.
So one of the features of disgust that makes it such an interesting emotion is that it's very, very easy to elicit, in fact more so than probably any of the other basic emotions, and so I'm going to show you that with a couple of images I can probably make you feel disgust.
So turn away. I'll tell you when you can turn back.
I mean, you see it every day, right? I mean, come on.
Okay, turn back, if you didn't look.
Those probably made a lot of you in the audience feel very, very disgusted, but if you didn't look, I can tell you about some of the other things that have been shown sort of across the world to make people disgusted, things like feces, urine, blood, rotten flesh.
These are the sorts of things that it makes sense for us to stay away from, because they might actually contaminate us.
In fact, just having a diseased appearance or odd sexual acts, these things are also things that give us a lot of disgust.
Darwin was probably one of the first scientists to systematically investigate the human emotions, and he pointed to the universal nature and the strength of the disgust response.
This is an anecdote from his travels in South America.
"In Tierro del Fuego a native touched with his finger some cold preserved meat while I was eating ...
and plainly showed disgust at its softness, whilst I felt utter disgust at my food being touched by a naked savage — — though his hands did not appear dirty."
He later wrote, "It's okay, some of my best friends are naked savages."
Well it turns out it's not only old-timey British scientists who are this squeamish. I recently got a chance to talk to Richard Dawkins for a documentary, and I was able to disgust him a bunch of times. Here's my favorite.
Richard Dawkins: "We've evolved around courtship and sex, are attached to deep-rooted emotions and reactions that are hard to jettison overnight."
David Pizarro: So my favorite part of this clip is that Professor Dawkins actually gagged.
He jumps back, and he gags, and we had to do it three times, and all three times he gagged.
And he was really gagging. I thought he might throw up on me, actually.
One of the features, though, of disgust, is not just its universality and its strength, but the way that it works through association.
So when one disgusting thing touches a clean thing, that clean thing becomes disgusting, not the other way around.
This makes it very useful as a strategy if you want to convince somebody that an object or an individual or an entire social group is disgusting and should be avoided.
The philosopher Martha Nussbaum points this out in this quote: "Thus throughout history, certain disgust properties -- sliminess, bad smell, stickiness, decay, foulness -- have been repeatedly and monotonously been associated with ...
Jews, women, homosexuals, untouchables, lower-class people -- all of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt of the body."
Let me give you just some examples of how, some powerful examples of how this has been used historically.
This comes from a Nazi children's book published in 1938: "Just look at these guys! The louse-infested beards, the filthy, protruding ears, those stained, fatty clothes...
Jews often have an unpleasant sweetish odor.
If you have a good nose, you can smell the Jews."
A more modern example comes from people who try to convince us that homosexuality is immoral.
This is from an anti-gay website, where they said gays are "worthy of death for their vile ... sex practices."
They're like "dogs eating their own vomit and sows wallowing in their own feces."
These are disgust properties that are trying to be directly linked to the social group that you should not like.
When we were first investigating the role of disgust in moral judgment, one of the things we became interested in was whether or not these sorts of appeals are more likely to work in individuals who are more easily disgusted.
So while disgust, along with the other basic emotions, are universal phenomena, it just really is true that some people are easier to disgust than others.
You could probably see it in the audience members when I showed you those disgusting images.
The way that we measured this was by a scale that was constructed by some other psychologists that simply asked people across a wide variety of situations how likely they are to feel disgust.
So here are a couple of examples.
"Even if I were hungry, I would not drink a bowl of my favorite soup if it had been stirred by a used but thoroughly washed fly-swatter."
"Do you agree or disagree?"
"While you are walking through a tunnel under a railroad track, you smell urine. Would you be very disgusted or not at all disgusted?"
If you ask enough of these, you can get a general overall score of disgust sensitivity.
It turns out that this score is actually meaningful.
When you bring people into the laboratory and you ask them if they're willing to engage in safe but disgusting behaviors like eating chocolate that's been baked to look like dog poop, or in this case eating some mealworms that are perfectly healthy but pretty gross, your score on that scale actually predicts whether or not you'll be willing to engage in those behaviors.
The first time that we set out to collect data on this and associate it with political or moral beliefs, we found a general pattern -- this is with the psychologists Yoel Inbar and Paul Bloom -- that in fact, across three studies we kept finding that people who reported that they were easily disgusted also reported that they were more politically conservative.
Another way to say this, though, is that people who are very liberal are very hard to disgust.
In a more recent follow-up study, we were able to look at a much greater sample, a much larger sample. In this case, this is nearly 30,000 U.S. respondents, and we find the same pattern. As you can see, people who are on the very conservative side of answering the political orientation scale are also much more likely to report that they're easily disgusted.
This data set also allowed us to statistically control for a number of things that we knew were both related to political orientation and to disgust sensitivity.
So we were able to control for gender, age, income, education, even basic personality variables, and the result stays the same.
When we actually looked at not just self-reported political orientation, but voting behavior, we were able to look geographically across the nation. What we found was that in regions in which people reported high levels of disgust sensitivity, McCain got more votes.
So it not only predicted self-reported political orientation, but actual voting behavior. And also we were able, with this sample, to look across the world, in 121 different countries we asked the same questions, and as you can see, this is 121 countries collapsed into 10 different geographical regions.
No matter where you look, what this is plotting is the size of the relationship between disgust sensitivity and political orientation, and no matter where we looked, we saw a very similar effect.
Other labs have actually looked at this as well using different measures of disgust sensitivity, so rather than asking people how easily disgusted they are, they hook people up to physiological measures, in this case skin conductance.
And what they've demonstrated is that people who report being more politically conservative are also more physiologically aroused when you show them disgusting images like the ones that I showed you.
Interestingly, what they also showed in a finding that we kept getting in our previous studies as well was that one of the strongest influences here is that individuals who are very disgust-sensitive not only are more likely to report being politically conservative, but they're also very much more opposed to gay marriage and homosexuality and pretty much a lot of the socio-moral issues in the sexual domain.
So physiological arousal predicted, in this study, attitudes toward gay marriage.
But even with all these data linking disgust sensitivity and political orientation, one of the questions that remains is what is the causal link here? Is it the case that disgust really is shaping political and moral beliefs?
We have to resort to experimental methods to answer this, and so what we can do is actually bring people into the lab and disgust them and compare them to a control group that hasn't been disgusted. It turns out that over the past five years a number of researchers have done this, and by and large the results have all been the same, that when people are feeling disgust, their attitudes shift towards the right of the political spectrum, toward more moral conservatism as well.
So this is whether you use a foul odor, a bad taste, from film clips, from post-hypnotic suggestions of disgust, images like the ones I've shown you, even just reminding people that disease is prevalent and they should be wary of it and wash up, right, to keep clean, these all have similar effects on judgment.
Let me just give you an example from a recent study that we conducted. We asked participants to just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups, and we either made the room smell gross or not.
When the room smelled gross, what we saw was that individuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men.
Disgust didn't influence attitudes toward all the other social groups that we asked, including African-Americans, the elderly. It really came down to the attitudes they had toward gay men.
In another set of studies we actually simply reminded people -- this was at a time when the swine flu was going around -- we reminded people that in order to prevent the spread of the flu that they ought to wash their hands.
For some participants, we actually had them take questionnaires next to a sign that reminded them to wash their hands.
And what we found was that just taking a questionnaire next to this hand-sanitizing reminder made individuals report being more politically conservative.
And when we asked them a variety of questions about the rightness or wrongness of certain acts, what we also found was that simply being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them more morally conservative.
In particular, when we asked them questions about sort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices, just being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them think that they were more morally wrong.
Let me give you an example of what I mean by harmless but taboo sexual practice. We gave them scenarios.
One of them said a man is house-sitting for his grandmother.
When his grandmother's away, he has sex with his girlfriend on his grandma's bed.
In another one, we said a woman enjoys masturbating with her favorite teddy bear cuddled next to her.
People find these to be more morally abhorrent if they've been reminded to wash their hands.
Okay. The fact that emotions influence our judgment should come as no surprise. I mean, that's part of how emotions work.
They not only motivate you to behave in certain ways, but they change the way you think.
In the case of disgust, what is a little bit more surprising is the scope of this influence. It makes perfect sense, and it's a very good emotion for us to have, that disgust would make me change the way that I perceive the physical world whenever contamination is possible.
It makes less sense that an emotion that was built to prevent me from ingesting poison should predict who I'm going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election.
The question of whether disgust ought to influence our moral and political judgments certainly has to be complex, and might depend on exactly what judgments we're talking about, and as a scientist, we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method is just ill-equipped to answer these sorts of questions.
But one thing that I am fairly certain about is, at the very least, what we can do with this research is point to what questions we ought to ask in the first place.
Thank you.

<title>David Pizarro: The strange politics of disgust</title>
<description>What does a disgusting image have to do with how you vote?

This is very strange for me, because I'm not used to doing this: I usually stand on the other side of the light, and now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into. And it's hard ...
The previous speaker has, I think, really painted a very good background as to the impulse behind my work and what drives me, and my sense of loss, and trying to find the answer to the big questions.
But this, for me, I mean, coming here to do this, feels like -- there's this sculptor that I like very much, Giacometti, who after many years of living in France -- and learning, you know, studying and working -- he returned home and he was asked, what did you produce?
What have you done with so many years of being away?
And he sort of, he showed a handful of figurines.
And obviously they were, "Is this what you spent years doing?
And we expected huge masterpieces!"
But what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a man's life, search, thought, everything -- just in a reduced, small version.
In a way, I feel like that.
I feel like I'm coming home to talk about what I've been away doing for 20 years.
And I will start with a brief taster of what I've been about: a handful of films -- nothing much, two feature films and a handful of short films.
So, we'll go with the first piece.
"I destroy lives," mum said.
I love her, you know.
She's not even my real mum.
My real mum and dad dumped me and fucked off back to Nigeria.
The devil is in me, Court.
Court: Sleep.
Have you ever been?
Court: Where?
Nigeria.
Court: Never.
My mum wanted to, couldn't afford it.
Wish I could.
I have this feeling I'd be happy there.
Why does everyone get rid of me?
Court: I don't want to get rid of you.
You don't need me.
You're just too blind to see it now.
Boy: What do you do all day?
Marcus: Read.
Boy: Don't you get bored?
And how come you ain't got a job anyway?
Marcus: I am retired.
Boy: So?
Marcus: So I've done my bit for Queen and country, now I work for myself.
Boy: No, now you sit around like a bum all day.
Marcus: Because I do what I like?
Boy: Look man, reading don't feed no one.
And it particularly don't feed your spliff habit.
Marcus: It feeds my mind and my soul.
Boy: Arguing with you is a waste of time, Marcus.
Marcus: You're a rapper, am I right?
Boy: Yeah.
Marcus: A modern day poet.
Boy: Yeah, you could say that.
Marcus: So what do you talk about?
Boy: What's that supposed to mean?
Marcus: Simple. What do you rap about?
Boy: Reality, man.
Marcus: Whose reality?
Boy: My fuckin' reality.
Marcus: Tell me about your reality.
Boy: Racism, oppression, people like me not getting a break in life.
Marcus: So what solutions do you offer? I mean, the job of a poet is not just -- Boy: Man, fight the power! Simple: blow the motherfuckers out of the sky.
Marcus: With an AK-47?
Boy: Man, if I had one, too fuckin' right.
Marcus: And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you?
Boy: Oh, Marcus, you know what I mean.
Marcus: When a man resorts to profanities, it's a sure sign of his inability to express himself.
Boy: See man, you're just taking the piss out of me now.
Marcus: The Panthers.
Boy: Panthers?
Ass kickin' guys who were fed up with all that white supremacist, powers-that-be bullshit, and just went in there and kicked everybody's arse.
Fuckin' wicked, man. I saw the movie. Bad! What?
Director 1: I saw his last film.
Épuise, right?
Woman 1: Yes.
D1: Not to make a bad joke, but it was really épuisé.
Epuisé -- tired, exhausted, fed up.
Director 2: Can you not shut up?
Now, you talk straight to me, what's wrong with my films?
Let's go.
W1: They suck.
They suck? What about yours?
What, what, what, what about, what?
What do you think about your movie?
D1: My movies, they are OK, fine.
They are better than making documentaries no one ever sees.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Did you ever move your fuckin' ass from Hollywood to go and film something real?
You make people fuckin' sleep.
Dream about bullshit.
Newton Aduaka: Thank you. The first clip, really, is totally trying to capture what cinema is for me, and where I'm coming from in terms of cinema.
The first piece was, really, there's a young woman talking about Nigeria, that she has a feeling she'll be happy there.
These are the sentiments of someone that's been away from home.
And that was something that I went through, you know, and I'm still going through.
I've not been home for quite a while, for about five years now.
I've been away 20 years in total.
And so it's really -- it's really how suddenly, you know, this was made in 1997, which is the time of Abacha -- the military dictatorship, the worst part of Nigerian history, this post-colonial history.
So, for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is.
How -- and it's sort of, perhaps romantic, but I think beautiful, because you just need something to hold on to, especially in a society where you feel alienated.
Which takes us to the next piece, where the young man talks about lack of opportunity: living as a black person in Europe, the glass ceiling that we all know about, that we all talk about, and his reality.
Again, this was my -- this was me talking about -- this was, again, the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom, and there was this buzzword -- and it was trying to say, what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people?
And what would a child -- what does a child like Jamie -- the young boy -- think, I mean, with all this anger that's built up inside of him?
What happens with that?
What, of course, happens with that is violence, which we see when we talk about the ghettos and we talk about, you know, South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff, and which eventually, when channeled, becomes, you know, evolves and manifests itself as riots -- like the one in France two years ago, where I live, which shocked everybody, because everyone thought, "Oh well, France is a liberal society."
But I lived in England for 18 years.
I've lived in France for about four, and I feel actually thrown back 20 years, living in France.
And then, the third piece. The third piece for me is the question: What is cinema to you? What do you do with cinema?
There's a young director, Hollywood director, with his friends -- fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means.
I suppose that will take me to my last piece -- what cinema means for me.
My life started as a -- I started life in 1966, a few months before the Biafran, which lasted for three years and it was three years of war.
So that whole thing, that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece.
Voice: Onicha, off to school with your brother.
Onicha: Yes, mama.
Commander: Soldiers, you are going to fight a battle, so you must get ready and willing to die.
You must get -- ?
Child Soldiers: Ready and willing to die.
C: Success, the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun.
CS: The barrel of the gun!
C: This is the gun.
CS: This is the gun.
C: This is an AK-47 rifle. This is your life.
This is your life. This is ... this is ... this is your life.
Ezra: They give us the special drugs. We call it bubbles.
Amphetamines.
Soldiers: Rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.
I say rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.
We went from one village to another -- three villages.
I don't remember how we got there.
Witness: We walked and walked for two days.
We didn't eat.
There was no food, just little rice.
Without food -- I was sick.
The injection made us not to have mind.
God will forgive us.
He knows we did not know. We did not know!
Committee Chairman: Do you remember January 6th, 1999?
Ezra: I don't remember.
Various Voices: You will die! You will die!
Onicha: Ezra!
Various Voices: We don't need no more trouble No more trouble They killed my mother.
The Mende sons of bastards.
Who is she?
Me.
Why you giving these to me?
So you can stop staring at me.
My story is a little bit complicated.
I'm interested.
Mariam is pregnant.
You know what you are? A crocodile.
Big mouth. Short legs.
In front of Rufus you are Ezra the coward.
He's not taking care of his troops.
Troop, pay your last honor. Salute.
Open your eyes, Ezra.
A blind man can see that the diamonds end up in his pocket.
We don't need no more trouble Get that idiot out!
I take you are preparing a major attack?
This must be the mine.
Your girl is here.
Well done, well done.
That is what you are here for, no?
You are planning to go back to fight are you?
We don't need no more trouble No more trouble We don't need no more trouble No more trouble. Wake up! Everybody wake up. Road block!
We don't need no more ... Committee Chairman: We hope that, with your help and the help of others, that this commission will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war.
More than that, begin a healing process and finally to -- as an act of closure to a terrible period in this country's history.
The beginning of hope.
Mr. Ezra Gelehun, please stand.
State your name and age for the commission.
Ezra: My name is Ezra Gelehun.
I am 15 or 16. I don't remember.
Ask my sister, she is the witch, she knows everything.
CC: Mr. Gelehun, I'd like to remind you you're not on trial here for any crimes you committed.
E: We were fighting for our freedom.
If killing in a war is a crime, then you have to charge every soldier in the world.
War is a crime, yes, but I did not start it.
You too are a retired General, not so?
CC: Yes, correct.
E: So you too must stand trial then.
Our government was corrupt.
Lack of education was their way to control power.
If I may ask, do you pay for school in your country?
CC: No, we don't.
E: You are richer than us.
But we pay for school.
Your country talks about democracy, but you support corrupt governments like my own.
Why? Because you want our diamond.
Ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before?
No.
CC: Mr. Gelehun, I'd like to remind you, you're not on trial here today.
You are not on trial.
E: Then let me go.
CC: I can't do that, son.
E: So you are a liar.
N Thank you. Just very quickly to say that my point really here, is that while we're making all these huge advancements, what we're doing, which for me, you know, I think we should -- Africa should move forward, but we should remember, so we do not go back here again.
Thank you.
Emeka Okafor: Thank you, Newton.
One of the themes that comes through very strongly in the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young that have to play this role of being child soldiers.
And considering where you are coming from, and when we consider the extent to which it's not taken as seriously as it should be, what would you have to say about that?
N In the process of my research, I actually spent a bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this.
And I remember I met a lot of child soldiers -- ex-combatants, as they like to be called.
I met psychosocial workers who worked with them.
I met psychiatrists who spent time with them, aid workers, NGOs, the whole lot.
But I remember on the flight back on my last trip, I remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself, if any kid in the West, in the western world, went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through, they will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives.
So for me, the thought that we have all these children -- it's a generation, we have a whole generation of children -- who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage, and Africa has to live with that.
But I'm just saying to factor that in, factor that in with all this great advancement, all this pronouncement of great achievement.
That's really my thinking.
EO: Well, we thank you again for coming to the TED stage.
That was a very moving piece.
N Thank you.
EO: Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/mike_matas.html</url>
So for the past year and a half, my team at Push Pop Press and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media have been working on creating the first feature-length interactive book.
It's called "Our Choice" and the author is Al Gore.
It's the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth," and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis.
The book starts like this. This is the cover.
As the globe spins, we can see our location, and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book.
Or, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom.
And if we wanted to zoom into a page, we can just open it up.
And anything you see in the book, you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up.
And if you want to go back and read the book again, you just fold it back up and put it back on the page.
And so this works the same way; you pick it up and pop it open.
I consider myself among the majority who look at windmills and feel they're a beautiful addition to the landscape.
Mike Matas: And so throughout the whole book, Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos.
This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map.
Zoom into it and see where it was taken.
And throughout the book, there's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations.
So you can open this one.
AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ...
MM: It starts playing immediately.
And while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page, and the movie keeps playing.
Or we can zoom out to the table of contents, and the video keeps playing.
But one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics.
This one shows the wind potential all around the United States.
But instead of just showing us the information, we can take our finger and explore, and see, state by state, exactly how much wind potential there is.
We can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power.
This is one of my favorites.
So this shows ...
When the wind is blowing, any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery.
And as the wind starts dying down, any excess energy will be diverted back into the house -- the lights never go out.
And this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad.
It also runs on the iPhone.
And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone.
And it works the exact same way.
You can pinch into any page.
Open it up.
So that's Push Pop Press' first title, Al Gore's "Our Choice."
Thank you.
That's spectacular.
Do you want to be a publisher, a technology licenser?
What is the business here?
Is this something that other people can do?
MM: Yeah, we're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content.
So Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast -- and we're on the West coast, building the software -- takes our tool and, every day, drags in images and text.
So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that?
All right. Mike, thanks so much.
MM: Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/frank_gehry_asks_then_what.html</url>
Frank Gehry: I listened to this scientist this morning.
Dr. Mullis was talking about his experiments, and I realized that I almost became a scientist.
When I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set and I decided to make water.
So, I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator, and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker and I threw a match in.
And the glass -- luckily I turned around -- I had it all in my back and I was about 15 feet away.
The wall was covered with ...
I had an explosion.
Richard Saul Wurman: Really?
FG: People on the street came and knocked on the door to see if I was okay.
RSW: ... huh.
I'd like to start this session again.
The gentleman to my left is the very famous, perhaps overly famous, Frank Gehry.
And Frank, you've come to a place in your life, which is astonishing.
I mean it is astonishing for an artist, for an architect, to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time.
I mean you have become, whether you can giggle at it because it's a funny ... you know, it's a strange thought, but your building is an icon -- you can draw a little picture of that building, it can be used in ads -- and you've had not rock star status, but celebrity status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life.
And I know the road was extremely difficult.
And it didn't seem, at least, that your sell outs, whatever they were, were very big.
You kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent on working for somebody.
But that's an interesting thing for a creative person.
A lot of us work for people; we're in the hands of other people.
And that's one of the great dilemmas -- we're in a creativity session -- it's one of the great dilemmas in creativity: how to do work that's big enough and not sell out.
And you've achieved that and that makes your win doubly big, triply big.
It's not quite a question but you can comment on it.
It's a big issue.
FG: Well, I've always just ...
I've never really gone out looking for work.
I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head.
And when I started out, I thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff.
And I realized when I'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff, and people would just look at me like I'd just landed from Mars.
But I couldn't do anything else.
That was my response to the people in the time.
And actually, it was responding to clients that I had who didn't have very much money, so they couldn't afford very much.
I think it was circumstantial.
Until I got to my house, where the client was my wife.
We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica and for like 50 grand I built a house around it.
And a few people got excited about it.
I was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer, out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere.
He's building this huge concrete place.
And it was late in the evening. We'd had a lot to drink.
We were standing out in the desert all alone and, thinking about my house, he said, "Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent, somewhere in 2000 years somebody's going to like it?"
So, I thought, "Yeah, that's probably a good idea."
Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money, so the stuff was a little more permanent.
But I just found out the world ain't going to last that long, this guy was telling us the other day.
So where do we go now?
Back to -- everything's so temporary.
I don't see it the way you characterized it.
For me, every day is a new thing.
I approach each project with a new insecurity, almost like the first project I ever did, and I get the sweats, I go in and start working, I'm not sure where I'm going -- if I knew where I was going, I wouldn't do it.
When I can predict or plan it, I don't do it.
I discard it.
So I approach it with the same trepidation.
Obviously, over time I have a lot more confidence that it's going to be OK.
I do run a kind of a business -- I've got 120 people and you've got to pay them, so there's a lot of responsibility involved -- but the actual work on the project is with, I think, a healthy insecurity.
And like the playwright said the other day -- I could relate to him: you're not sure.
When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it, I saw all the mistakes, I saw ...
They weren't mistakes; I saw everything that I would have changed and I was embarrassed by it.
I felt an embarrassment -- "How could I have done that?
How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that?"
It's taken several years to now look at it detached and say -- as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road and the street, and it appears to have a relationship -- that I started to like it.
RSW: What's the status of the New York project?
FG: I don't really know.
Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me, and I thought he was nuts.
I didn't think he knew what he was doing, and he pulled it off.
So, I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy.
He gets up there and then he ... comes back up.
They're still talking about it.
September 11 generated some interest in moving it over to Ground Zero, and I'm totally against that.
I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero I think for a long time.
RSW: The picture on the screen, is that Disney?
FG: Yeah.
RSW: How much further along is it than that, and when will that be finished?
FG: That will be finished in 2003 -- September, October -- and I'm hoping Kyu, and Herbie, and Yo-Yo and all those guys come play with us at that place.
Luckily, today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like.
Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that Disney Hall came to me.
He's been a cheerleader for quite a long time.
There aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients.
If you think about the world, and even just in this audience, most of us are involved with buildings.
Nothing that you would call architecture, right?
And so to find one, a guy like that, you hang on to him.
He's become the head of Art Center, and there's a building by Craig Ellwood there.
I knew Craig and respected him.
They want to add to it and it's hard to add to a building like that -- it's a beautiful, minimalist, black steel building -- and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff and it's a lot of acreage.
I convinced him to let me bring in another architect from Portugal: Alvaro Siza.
RSW: Why did you want that?
FG: I knew you'd ask that question.
It was intuitive.
Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture.
I visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work, and his early work had a resemblance to my early work.
When I came out of college, I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California, and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that.
I tried to understand that language as a beginning, as a place to jump off, and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't ...
I just stopped.
I mean, Charlie Moore did a bunch of it, but it didn't feel good to me.
Siza, on the other hand, continued in Portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language.
And I always felt that he should come to Southern California and do a building.
I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out.
I like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you.
I've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra, who doesn't think architecture is art.
Did you see that thing?
RSW: No. What did he say?
FG: He calls architecture "plumbing."
FG: Anyway, the Siza thing.
It's a richer experience.
It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians -- it's similar to that I would imagine -- where you ... huh?
Audience: Liquid architecture.
FG: Liquid architecture.
Where you ... It's like jazz: you improvise, you work together, you play off each other, you make something, they make something.
And I think for me, it's a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city.
RSW: Is it going to be near the current campus?
Or is it going to be down near ...
FG: No, it's near the current campus.
Anyway, he's that kind of patron.
It's not his money, of course.
RSW: What's his schedule on that?
FG: I don't know.
What's the schedule, Richard?
Richard Koshalek: [Unclear] starts from 2004.
FG: 2004.
You can come to the opening. I'll invite you.
No, but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos, right?
Everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment, and if you can figure out how to work off each other -- if you can get a bunch of people who respect each other's work and play off each other, you might be able to create models for how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect.
Like the Rockefeller Center model, which is kind of from another era.
RSW: I found the most remarkable thing.
My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building, you go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces.
I'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED.
The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city.
That was the surprise of going across the river, of going on the highway around it, of walking down the street and finding it.
That was the real surprise of Bilbao.
FG: But you know, Richard, most architects when they present their work -- most of the people we know, you get up and you talk about your work, and it's almost like you tell everybody you're a good guy by saying, "Look, I'm worried about the context, I'm worried about the city, I'm worried about my client, I worry about budget, that I'm on time."
Blah, blah, blah and all that stuff.
And it's like cleansing yourself so that you can ...
by saying all that, it means your work is good somehow.
And I think everybody -- I mean that should be a matter of fact, like gravity.
You're not going to defy gravity.
You've got to work with the building department.
If you don't meet the budgets, you're not going to get much work.
If it leaks -- Bilbao did not leak.
I was so proud.
The MIT project -- they were interviewing me for MIT and they sent their facilities people to Bilbao.
I met them in Bilbao.
They came for three days.
RSW: This is the computer building?
FG: Yeah, the computer building.
They were there three days and it rained every day and they kept walking around -- I noticed they were looking under things and looking for things, and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden, you know?
People put buckets out ...
I was clean. There wasn't a bloody leak in the place, it was just fantastic.
But you've got to -- yeah, well up until then every building leaked, so this ...
RSW: Frank had a sort of ...
FG: Ask Miriam!
RW: ... sort of had a fame. His fame was built on that in L.A. for a while.
FG: You've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story, when the woman called and said, "Mr. Wright, I'm sitting on the couch and the water's pouring in on my head."
And he said, "Madam, move your chair."
So, some years later I was doing a building, a little house on the beach for Norton Simon, and his secretary, who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady, called me and said, "Mr. Simon's sitting at his desk and the water's coming in on his head."
And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story.
RSW: Didn't get a laugh.
FG: No. Not now either.
But my point is that ... and I call it the "then what?"
OK, you solved all the problems, you did all the stuff, you made nice, you loved your clients, you loved the city, you're a good guy, you're a good person ...
and then what?
What do you bring to it?
And I think that's what I've always been interested in, is that -- which is a personal kind of expression.
Bilbao, I think, shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases that are necessary of fitting into the city.
That's what reminded me of it.
And I think that's the issue, you know; it's the "then what" that most clients who hire architects -- most clients aren't hiring architects for that.
They're hiring them to get it done, get it on budget, be polite, and they're missing out on the real value of an architect.
RSW: At a certain point a number of years ago, people -- when Michael Graves was a fashion, before teapots ...
FG: I did a teapot and nobody bought it.
RSW: Did it leak?
FG: No.
RSW: ... people wanted a Michael Graves building.
Is that a curse, that people want a Bilbao building?
FG: Yeah.
Since Bilbao opened, which is now four, five years, both Krens and I have been called with at least 100 opportunities -- China, Brazil, other parts of Spain -- to come in and do the Bilbao effect.
And I've met with some of these people.
Usually I say no right away, but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well-intentioned and they get you for at least one or two meetings.
In one case, I flew all the way to Malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city, and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port.
I asked them what kind of building it was.
"When you get here we'll explain it." Blah, blah, blah.
So four of us went.
And they took us -- they put us up in a great hotel and we were looking over the bay, and then they took us in a boat out in the water and showed us all these sights in the harbor.
Each one was more beautiful than the other.
And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in Malaga.
Just before going to lunch with the mayor, we went to the harbor commissioner.
It was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here, and I was here, and my guys.
We sat down, and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet.
And the guy looked at me and said, "Now what can I do for you, Mr. Gehry?"
RSW: Oh, my God.
FG: So, I got up.
I said to my team, "Let's get out of here."
We stood up, we walked out.
They followed -- the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said, "You mean you're not going to have lunch with the mayor?"
I said, "Nope."
"You're not going to have dinner at all?"
They just brought us there to hustle this group, you know, to create a project.
And we get a lot of that.
Luckily, I'm old enough that I can complain I can't travel.
I don't have my own plane yet.
RSW: Well, I'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it's been very long.
But let me just say a couple words.
FG: Can I say something?
Are you going to talk about me or you?
RSW: Once a shit, always a shit!
FG: Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody, so ...
RSW: You're going to get one! You're going to get one!
I'm going to make it for you!
FG: No, no. Wait a minute!

Walk around for four months with three wishes, and all the ideas will start to percolate up.
I think everybody should do it -- think that you've got three wishes.
And what would you do? It's actually a great exercise to really drill down to the things that you feel are important, and really reflect on the world around us.
And thinking that, can an individual actually do something, or come up with something, that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference?
Inspired by nature -- that's the theme here.
And I think, quite frankly, that's where I started.
I became very interested in the landscape as a Canadian.
We have this Great North. And there was a pretty small population, and my father was an avid outdoorsman.
So I really had a chance to experience that.
And I could never really understand exactly what it was, or how it was informing me.
But what I think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening, and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines, the untouched forest that I was able to see -- really bring in a sense of that geological time, that this has gone on for a long time, and we're experiencing it in a different way.
And that, to me, was a reference point that I think I needed to have to be able to make the work that I did.
And I did go out, and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring, along a roadside.
This rebirth of grass. And then I went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape.
But as a fine-art photographer I somehow felt that it wouldn't catch on out there, that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career.
And I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture, or something of that nature, and I couldn't get away from it.
So I started to think of, how can I rethink the landscape?
I decided to rethink the landscape as the landscape that we've transformed.
I had a bit of an epiphany being lost in Pennsylvania, and I took a left turn trying to get back to the highway.
And I ended up in a town called Frackville.
I got out of the car, and I stood up, and it was a coal-mining town. I did a 360 turnaround, and that became one of the most surreal landscapes I've ever seen.
Totally transformed by man.
And that got me to go out and look at mines like this, and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions in the landscape that I could find.
And that became the baseline of what I was doing.
And it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto, and not have to re-invent myself -- that this theme was large enough to become a life's work, to become something that I could sink my teeth into and just research and find out where these industries are.
And I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my thanks, which I kind of missed, was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in.
Because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs -- to get into that place to make those photographs, and if it wasn't for those people letting me in at the heads of those corporations, I would have never made this body of work.
So in that respect, to me, I'm not against the corporation.
I own a corporation. I work with them, and I feel that we all need them and they're important.
But I am also for sustainability.
So there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions.
And I'm not making an indictment towards what's happening here, but it is a slow progression.
So I started thinking, well, we live in all these ages of man: the Stone Age, and the Iron Age, and the Copper Age.
And these ages of man are still at work today.
But we've become totally disconnected from them.
There's something that we're not seeing there.
And it's a scary thing as well. Because when we start looking at the collective appetite for our lifestyles, and what we're doing to that landscape -- that, to me, is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate.
And through my photographs, I'm hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work, and to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image.
Not to say, "Oh my God, what is it?" but to be challenged by it -- to say, "Wow, this is beautiful," on one level, but on the other level, "This is scary. I shouldn't be enjoying it."
Like a forbidden pleasure. And it's that forbidden pleasure that I think is what resonates out there, and it gets people to look at these things, and it gets people to enter it. And it also, in a way, defines kind of what I feel, too -- that I'm drawn to have a good life.
I want a house, and I want a car.
But there's this consequence out there.
And how do I begin to have that attraction, repulsion?
It's even in my own conscience I'm having it, and here in my work, I'm trying to build that same toggle.
These things that I photographed -- this tire pile here had 45 million tires in it. It was the largest one.
It was only about an hour-and-a-half away from me, and it caught fire about four years ago. It's around Westley, California, around Modesto.
And I decided to start looking at something that, to me, had -- if the earlier work of looking at the landscape had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature, in the recycling work that you're seeing here was starting to point to a direction. To me, it was our redemption.
That in the recycling work that I was doing, I'm looking for a practice, a human activity that is sustainable.
That if we keep putting things, through industrial and urban existence, back into the system -- if we keep doing that -- we can continue on.
Of course, listening at the conference, there's many, many things that are coming. Bio-mimicry, and there's many other things that are coming on stream -- nanotechnology that may also prevent us from having to go into that landscape and tear it apart.
And we all look forward to those things.
But in the meantime, these things are scaling up.
These things are continuing to happen.
What you're looking at here -- I went to Bangladesh, so I started to move away from North America; I started to look at our world globally.
These images of Bangladesh came out of a radio program I was listening to.
They were talking about Exxon Valdez, and that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers because of the insurance industries.
And that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned, and 2004 was going to be the pinnacle.
And I thought, "My God, wouldn't that be something?"
To see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand, literally, in third-world countries.
So originally I was going to go to India.
And I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there, and then I was able to get into Bangladesh, and saw for the first time a third world, a view of it, that I had never actually thought was possible.
130 million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin -- people everywhere -- the pollution was intense, and the working conditions were horrible.
Here you're looking at some oil fields in California, some of the biggest oil fields. And again, I started to think that -- there was another epiphany -- that the whole world I was living in was a result of having plentiful oil.
And that, to me, was again something that I started building on, and I continued to build on.
So this is a series I'm hoping to have ready in about two or three years, under the heading of "The Oil Party."
Because I think everything that we're involved in -- our clothing, our cars, our roads, and everything -- are directly a result.
I'm going to move to some pictures of China.
And for me China -- I started photographing it four years ago, and China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind, not to mention that China, as well, has a great effect on the industries that I grew up around.
I came out of a blue-collar town, a GM town, and my father worked at GM, so I was very familiar with that kind of industry and that also informed my work. But you know, to see China and the scale at which it's evolving, is quite something.
So what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam, and this is the largest dam by 50 percent ever attempted by man.
Most of the engineers around the world left the project because they said, "It's just too big."
In fact, when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago, they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning.
It took fifteen days to fill it.
So this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long, one of the largest reservoirs ever created.
And what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir, and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships.
This is a "before and after." So that was before.
And this is like 10 weeks later, demolished by hand.
I think 11 of the buildings they used dynamite, everything else was by hand. That was 10 weeks later.
And this gives you an idea.
And it was all the people who lived in those homes, were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working, and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart.
And these are some of the images from that.
So I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam, looking at that massive transformation of a landscape.
And it looks like a bombed-out landscape, but it isn't.
What it is, it's a landscape that is an intentional one.
This is a need for power, and they're willing to go through this massive transformation, on this scale, to get that power.
And again, it's actually a relief for what's going on in China because I think on the table right now, there's 27 nuclear power stations to be built.
There hasn't been one built in North America for 20 years because of the "NIMBY" problem -- "Not In My BackYard."
But in China they're saying, "No, we're putting in 27 in the next 10 years."
And coal-burning furnaces are going in there for hydroelectric power literally weekly.
So coal itself is probably one of the largest problems.
And one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges -- a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost; some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that.
And 1.2 to 2 million people were relocated, depending on whose statistics you're looking at.
And this is what they were building.
This is Wushan, one of the largest cities that was relocated.
This is the town hall for the city.
And again, the rebuilding of the city -- to me, it was sad to see that they didn't really grab a lot of, I guess, what we know here, in terms of urban planning.
There were no parks; there were no green spaces.
Very high-density living on the side of a hill.
And here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up, but somehow were not connecting with them.
Here is a sign that, translated, says, "Obey the birth control law.
Build our science, civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth."
So here, if you look at this poster, it has all the trappings of Western culture.
You're seeing the tuxedos, the bouquets.
But what's really, to me, frightening about the picture and about this billboard is the refinery in the background.
So it's like marrying up all the things that we have and it's an adaptation of our way of life, full stop.
And again, when you start seeing that kind of embrace, and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle with a very, very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle with a much higher footprint, it starts to become very sobering.
This is a shot in one of the biggest squares in Guangdong -- and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country.
And there's about 130 million people in migration trying to get into urban centers at all times, and in the next 10 to 15 years, are expecting another 400 to 500 million people to migrate into the urban centers like Shanghai and the manufacturing centers.
The manufacturers are -- the domestics are usually -- you can tell a domestic factory by the fact that they all use the same color uniforms.
So this is a pink uniform at this factory. It's a shoe factory.
And they have dorms for the workers.
So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms.
This is one of the biggest shoe factories, the Yuyuan shoe factory near Shenzhen. It has 90,000 employees making shoes.
This is a shift change, one of three.
There's two factories of this scale in the same town.
This is one with 45,000, so every lunch, there's about 12,000 coming through for lunch.
They sit down; they have about 20 minutes.
The next round comes in. It's an incredible workforce that's building there. Shanghai -- I'm looking at the urban renewal in Shanghai, and this is a whole area that will be flattened and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years.
What's also happening in Shanghai is -- China is changing because this wouldn't have happened five years ago, for instance. This is a holdout.
They're called dengzahoos -- they're like pin tacks to the ground.
They won't move. They're not negotiating.
They're not getting enough, so they're not going to move.
And so they're holding off until they get a deal with them.
And they've been actually quite successful in getting better deals because most of them are getting a raw deal.
They're being put out about two hours -- the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years, or maybe even thousands of years, are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas outside of Shanghai. But these are a whole series of guys holding out in this reconstruction of Shanghai.
Probably the largest urban-renewal project, I think, ever attempted on the planet.
And then the embrace of the things that they're replacing it with -- again, one of my wishes, and I never ended up going there, was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house.
The kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something, and these are called the villas.
And also, like right now, they're just moving.
The scaffolding is still on, and this is an e-waste area, and if you looked in the foreground on the big print, you'd see that the industry -- their industry -- they're all recycling.
So the industry's already growing around these new developments.
This is a five-level bridge in Shanghai.
Shanghai was a very intriguing city -- it's exploding on a level that I don't think any city has experienced.
In fact, even Shenzhen, the economic zone -- one of the first ones -- 15 years ago was about 100,000 people, and today it boasts about 10 to 11 million.
So that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which -- this is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen.
There's 9,000 of them here, and they're being built for most of the big cities, Beijing and Shanghai, Shenzhen.
And this isn't even the domestic car market; this is the taxi market.
And what we would see here as a suburban development -- a similar thing, but they're all high-rises.
So they'll put 20 or 40 up at a time, and they just go up in the same way as a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area.
And the density is quite incredible.
And one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out is that when I saw these kinds of buildings, I was shocked to see that they're not using a central air-conditioning system; every window has an air conditioner in it.
And I'm sure there are people here who probably know better than I do about efficiencies, but I can't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale.
And when you start looking at that, and then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai, it's literally a forest of skyscrapers.
It's breathtaking, in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming.
And you can see in the foreground of this picture, it's still one of the last areas that was being held up.
Right now that's all cleared out -- this was done about eight months ago -- and high-rises are now going up into that central spot.
So a skyscraper is built, literally, overnight in Shanghai.
Most recently I went in, and I started looking at some of the biggest industries in China.
And this is Baosteel, right outside of Shanghai.
This is the coal supply for the steel factory -- 18 square kilometers.
It's an incredibly massive operation, I think 15,000 workers, five cupolas, and the sixth one's coming in here.
So they're building very large blast furnaces to try to deal with the demand for steel in China.
So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot.
And again, looking at these images, there's this constant, like, haze that you're seeing.
This is going to show you, real time, an assembler. It's a circuit breaker.
10 hours a day at this speed.
I think one of the issues that we here are facing with China, is that they're using a lot of the latest production technology.
In that one, there were 400 people that worked on the floor.
And I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers, and then I went and looked at each one of them for about 15 or 20 minutes, and picked this one woman.
And it was just lightning fast; the way she was working was almost unbelievable.
But that is the trick that they've got right now, that they're winning with, is that they're using all the latest technologies and extrusion machines, and bringing all the components into play, but the assembly is where they're actually bringing in -- the country workers are very willing to work. They want to work.
There's a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs.
That condition's going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years if they realize what they want, which is, you know, 400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities.
In this particular case -- this is the assembly line that you saw; this is a shot of it.
I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field.
I had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot.
It took me five fake tries because they were just going. To slow them down was literally impossible.
They were just wound up doing these things all day long, until the manager had to, with a stern voice, say, "Okay, everybody freeze."
It wasn't too bad, but they're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate.
This is a textile mill doing synthetic silk, an oil byproduct.
And what you're seeing here is, again, one of the most state-of-the-art textile mills.
There are 500 of these machines; they're worth about 200,000 dollars each.
So you have about 12 people running this, and they're just inspecting it -- and they're just walking the lines.
The machines are all running, absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are.
And I started getting in further and further into the factories.
And that's a diptych. I do a lot of pairings to try and get the sense of scale in these places.
This is a line where they get the threads and they wind the threads together, pre-going into the textile mills.
Here's something that's far more labor-intensive, which is the making of shoes.
This floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor.
The company itself had about 10,000 employees, and they're doing domestic shoes.
It was very hard to get into the international companies because I had to get permission from companies like Nike and Adidas, and that's very hard to get.
And they don't want to let me in.
But the domestic was much easier to do.
It just gives you a sense of, again -- and that's where, really, the whole migration of jobs started going over to China and making the shoes. Nike was one of the early ones.
It was such a high labor component to it that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market.
This is a high-tech mobile phone: Bird mobile phone, one of the largest mobile makers in China.
I think mobile phone companies are popping up, literally, on a weekly basis, and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones.
This is a textile where they're doing shirts -- Youngor, the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China.
And this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms.
Everything is very efficient.
While setting up this shot, people on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch.
This was one of the biggest factories I've ever seen.
They make coffeemakers here, the biggest coffeemaker and the biggest iron makers -- they make 20 million of them in the world.
There's 21,000 employees. This one factory -- and they had several of them -- is half a kilometer long.
These are just recently shot -- I just came back about a month ago, so you're the first ones to be seeing these, these new factory pictures I've taken.
So it's taken me almost a year to gain access into these places.
The other aspect of what's happening in China is that there's a real need for materials there.
So a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here are being recycled and taken to China by ships.
That's cubed metal. This is armatures, electrical armatures, where they're getting the copper and the high-end steel from electrical motors out, and recycling them.
This is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley.
But this is what happens to most of the computers.
Fifty percent of the world's computers end up in China to be recycled.
It's referred to as "e-waste" there.
And it is a bit of a problem. The way they recycle the boards is that they actually use the coal briquettes, which are used all through China, but they heat up the boards, and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components.
They're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components.
But the toxic smells -- when you come into a town that's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards, you can smell it a good five or 10 kilometers before you get there.
Here's another operation. It's all cottage industries, so it's not big places -- it's all in people's front porches, in their backyards, even in their homes they're burning boards, if there's a concern for somebody coming by -- because it is considered in China to be illegal, doing it, but they can't stop the product from coming in.
This portrait -- I'm not usually known for portraits, but I couldn't resist this one, where she's been through Mao, and she's been through the Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural Revolution, and now she's sitting on her porch with this e-waste beside her. It's quite something.
This is a road where it's been shored up by computer boards in one of the biggest towns where they're recycling.
So that's the photographs that I wanted to show you.
I want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls.
They've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I've been thinking.
One's Megan, the one of the right, and Katja there.
And to me the whole notion -- the things I'm photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress.
And as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it's palpable in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems, I'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect.
And it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world, but it starts to go up -- because I think we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down -- but there's a growing footprint that's happening in Asia, and is growing at a rapid, rapid rate, and so I don't think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy, I think, here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution, because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well.
So part of my thinking, and part of my wishes, is sitting with these thoughts in mind, and thinking about, "How is their life going to be when they want to have children, or when they're ready to get married 20 years from now -- or whatever, 15 years from now?"
And to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking -- in my work, and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes.
Wish one: world-changing. I want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability.
And it is through communications today that I believe that that is not an unreal idea.
Oh, and I went in search -- I wanted to put what I had in mind, hitch it onto something. I didn't want a wish just to start from nowhere.
One of them I'm starting from almost nothing, but the other one, I wanted to find out what's going on that's working right now.
And Worldchanging.com is a fantastic blog, and that blog is now being visited by close to half-a-million people a month.
And it just started about 14 months ago.
And the beauty of what's going on there is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like.
What they're doing there is that they're not -- I think the environmental movement has failed in that it's used the stick too much; it's used the apocalyptic tone too much; it hasn't sold the positive aspects of being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out.
Whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog is about positive movements, about how to change our world in a better way, quickly.
And it's looking at technology, and it's looking at new energy-saving devices, and it's looking at how to rethink and how to re-strategize the movement towards sustainability.
And so for me, one of the things that I thought would be to put some of my work in the service of promoting the Worldchanging.com website.
Some of you might know, he's a TEDster -- Stephen Sagmeister and I are working on some layouts. And this is still in preliminary stages; these aren't the finals. But these images, with Worldchanging.com, can be placed into any kind of media.
They could be posted through the Web; they could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter, or anything of that nature.
So we're looking at this as trying to build out.
And what we ended up discussing was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text, and the text is blasted all over.
What was unusual, according to Stephen, is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image.
And so in this case, because it's about a lot of these images and what they represent, and the kinds of questions they bring up, that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say, "Well, what's Worldchanging.com, with these images, have to do?"
And hopefully inspire people to go to that website.
So Worldchanging.com, and building that blog, and it is a blog, and I'm hoping that it isn't -- I don't see it as the kind of blog where we're all going to follow each other to death.
This one is one that will spoke out, and will go out, and to start reaching. Because right now there's conversations in India, in China, in South America -- there's entries coming from all around the world.
I think there's a chance to have a dialogue, a conversation about sustainability at Worldchanging.com.
And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic.
Wish two is more of the bottom-up, ground-up one that I'm trying to work with.
And this one is: I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition that motivates kids to invest ideas on, and invent ideas on, sustainability.
And one of the things that came out -- Allison, who actually nominated me, said something earlier on in a brainstorming. She said that recycling in Canada had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six.
And you think about it, you know, grade four -- my wife and I, we say age seven is the age of reason, so they're into the age of reason. And they're pre-puberty.
So it's this great window where they actually are -- you can influence them. You know what happens at puberty?
You know, we know that from earlier presentations.
So my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids to start driving home ideas. Let them understand what sustainability is, and that they have a vested interest in it to happen.
And one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize, so I would take 30,000 or 40,000 dollars of the winnings, and the rest is going to be to manage this project, but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands.
But the other thing that I thought would be fantastic was to create these -- call them "prize targets."
And so one could be for the best sustainable idea for an in-school project, the best one for a household project, or it could be the best community project for sustainability.
And I also thought there should be a nice prize for the best artwork for "In My World." And what would happen -- it's a scalable thing. And if we can get people to put in things -- whether it's equipment, like a media lab, or money to make the prize significant enough -- and to open it up to all the schools that are public schools, or schools that are with kids that age, and make it a wide-open competition for them to go after those prizes and to submit them.
And the prize has to be a verifiable thing, so it's not about just ideas.
The art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them, but the actual things have to be verifiable.
In that way, what's happening is that we're motivating a certain age group to start thinking.
And they're going to push that up, from the bottom -- up into, I believe, into the households. And parents will be reacting to it, and trying to help them with the projects.
And I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability in a very positive way, and starts to teach them. They know about recycling now, but they don't really, I think, get sustainability in all the things, and the energy footprint, and how that matters.
And to teach them, to me, would be a fantastic wish, and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into.
And again, in "In My World," the competition -- we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it.
And I like the words, "in my world," because it gives possession of the world to the person who's doing it.
It is my world; it's not someone else's. I want to help it; I want to do something with it. So I think it has a great opportunity to engage the imaginations -- and great ideas, I think, come from kids -- and engage their imagination into a project, and do something for schools.
I think all schools could use extra equipment, extra cash -- it's going to be an incentive for them to do that.
And these are some of the ideas in terms of where we could possibly put in some promotion for "In My World."
And wish three is: Imax film. So I was told I should do one for myself, and I've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something.
And the scale of my work, and the kinds of ideas I'm playing with -- when I first saw an Imax film, I almost immediately thought, "There's a real resonance between what I'm trying to do and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer."
And I think there's a real possibility to reach new audiences if I had a chance.
So I'm looking, really, for a mentor, because I just had my birthday.
I'm 50, and I don't have time to go back to school right now -- I'm too busy. So I need somebody who can put me on a quick catch-up course on how to do something like that, and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this.
That would be fantastic. So those are my three wishes.

I'm a garbage man.
And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man, because I absolutely hate waste.
I hope, within the next 10 minutes, to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life.
And I'd like to start at the very beginning.
Think back when you were just a kid.
How did look at the stuff in your life?
Perhaps it was like these toddler rules: It's my stuff if I saw it first.
The entire pile is my stuff if I'm building something.
The more stuff that's mine, the better.
And of course, it's your stuff if it's broken.
Well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry, it's become pretty clear to me that we don't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults.
And let me tell you why I have that perspective.
Because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people's discarded stuff.
Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff, but it's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world -- well less than one percent.
In fact, the United Nations estimates that there's about 85 billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year -- and that's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream.
And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth, that number well more than doubles.
And of course, the more developed the country, the bigger these mountains.
Now when you see these mountains, most people think of garbage.
We see above-ground mines.
And the reason we see mines is because there's a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place.
And it's becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams.
Because as we've heard all week at TED, the world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff.
And of course, they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted.
And what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day?
It's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals.
And the metals, we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world.
And the plastics, we get from oil, which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract.
And these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we're already starting to see today.
The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff and starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff, particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner.
Most of what's extracted from our end-of-life stuff, if it makes it to a recycler, are the metals.
To put that in perspective -- and I'm using steel as a proxy here for metals, because it's the most common metal -- if your stuff makes it to a recycler, probably over 90 percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose.
Plastics are a whole other story: well less than 10 percent are recovered.
In fact, it's more like five percent.
Most of it's incinerated or landfilled.
Now most people think that's because plastics are a throw-away material, have very little value.
But actually, plastics are several times more valuable than steel.
And there's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel.
So why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material?
Well it's predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another.
They have very different densities.
They have different electrical and magnetic properties.
And they even have different colors.
So it's very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials.
Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range.
They have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties.
And any plastic can be any color, as you probably well know.
So the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don't work for plastics.
Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world -- and sadly to say, particularly from the United States, where we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe -- finds its way to developing countries for low-cost recycling.
People, for as little as a dollar a day, pick through our stuff.
They extract what they can, which is mostly the metals -- circuit boards and so forth -- and they leave behind mostly what they can't recover, which is, again, mostly the plastics.
Or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here.
And they extract the metals by hand.
Now while this may be the low-economic-cost solution, this is certainly not the low-environmental or human health-and-safety solution.
I call this environmental arbitrage.
And it's not fair, it's not safe and it's not sustainable.
Now because the plastics are so plentiful -- and by the way, those other methods don't lead to the recovery of plastics, obviously -- but people do try to recover the plastics.
This is just one example.
This is a photo I took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai, India.
They store the plastics on the roofs.
They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these, and people try very hard to separate the plastics, by color, by shape, by feel, by any technique they can.
And sometimes they'll resort to what's known as the "burn and sniff" technique where they'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic.
None of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way.
And by the way, please don't try this technique at home.
So what are we to do about this space-age material, at least what we used to call a space-aged material, these plastics?
Well I certainly believe that it's far too valuable and far too abundant to keep putting back in the ground or certainly send up in smoke.
So about 20 years ago, I literally started in my garage tinkering around, trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other, and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends, in the mining world actually, and in the plastics world, and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world.
Because after all, we're doing above-ground mining.
And we eventually broke the code.
This is the last frontier of recycling.
It's the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth.
And we finally figured out how to do it.
And in the process, we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics.
The traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals.
You breakdown the molecules, you recombine them in very specific ways, to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day.
We said, there's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics.
And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint, sustainable from an economic standpoint as well.
Well a good place to start is with waste.
It certainly doesn't cost as much as oil, and it's plentiful, as I hope that you've been able to see from the photographs.
And because we're not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them, we're using a mining approach to extract the materials.
We have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment.
We have enormous energy savings.
I don't know how many other projects on the planet right now can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way.
And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life, our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them.
And we make a drop-in replacement for that plastic that's made from petrochemicals.
Our customers get to enjoy huge CO2 savings.
They get to close the loop with their products.
And they get to make more sustainable products.
In the short time period I have, I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this.
It starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits.
They recover the metals and leave behind what's called shredder residue -- it's their waste -- a very complex mixture of materials, but predominantly plastics.
We take out the things that aren't plastics, such as the metals they missed, carpeting, foam, rubber, wood, glass, paper, you name it.
Even an occasional dead animal, unfortunately.
And it goes in the first part of our process here, which is more like traditional recycling.
We're sieving the material, we're using magnets, we're using air classification.
It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point.
At the end of this process, we have a mixed plastic composite: many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics.
This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process, and the really hard work, multi-step separation process begins.
We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail.
We use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics, not only by type, but by grade.
And out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic: one type, one grade.
We then use optical sorting to color sort this material.
We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos.
We push that material to extruders where we melt it, push it through small die holes, make spaghetti-like plastic strands.
And we chop those strands into what are called pellets.
And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry.
This is the same material that you would get from oil.
And today, we're producing it from your old stuff, and it's going right back into your new stuff.
So now, instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke, you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products, in your office, or back at work in your home.
And these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic, replacing virgin plastic, to make their new products.
So I hope I've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life.
We took our clues from mother nature.
Mother nature wastes very little, reuses practically everything.
And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer -- that's a label I've always hated my entire life -- and think of yourself as just using resources in one form, until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time.
And finally, I hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to: "If it's broken, it's my stuff."
Thank you for your time.

<title>Mike Biddle: We can recycle plastic</title>
<description>Less than 10% of plastic trash is recycled -- compared to almost 90% of metals -- because of the massively complicated problem of finding and sorting the different kinds. Frustrated by this waste, Mike Biddle has developed a cheap and incredibly energy efficient plant that can, and does, recycle any kind of plastic. &lt;a href="http://blog.ted.com/2012/10/22/a-better-way-to-recycle-plastics-mike-biddle-replies-to-questions-and-comments-about-his-2011-tedtalk"&gt;Read Mike's responses to questions about this talk.&lt;/a&gt;</description>
<keywords>business,global issues,green,plastic,technology</keywords>
<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/laurie_santos.html</url>
I want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species.
The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious, and that's that our species, Homo sapiens, is actually really, really smart -- like, ridiculously smart -- like you're all doing things that no other species on the planet does right now.
And this is, of course, not the first time you've probably recognized this.
Of course, in addition to being smart, we're also an extremely vain species.
So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart.
You know, so I could turn to pretty much any sage from Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert to point out things like the fact that we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties and just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planet when it comes to all things cerebral.
But of course, there's a second observation about the human species that I want to focus on a little bit more, and that's the fact that even though we're actually really smart, sometimes uniquely smart, we can also be incredibly, incredibly dumb when it comes to some aspects of our decision making.
Now I'm seeing lots of smirks out there.
Don't worry, I'm not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes.
But of course, just in the last two years we see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude.
And we've watched as the tools we uniquely make to pull the resources out of our environment kind of just blow up in our face.
We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create -- these markets that were supposed to be foolproof -- we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes.
But both of these two embarrassing examples, I think, don't highlight what I think is most embarrassing about the mistakes that humans make, which is that we'd like to think that the mistakes we make are really just the result of a couple bad apples or a couple really sort of FAIL Blog-worthy decisions.
But it turns out, what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us, when put in certain contexts, will actually make very specific mistakes.
The errors we make are actually predictable.
We make them again and again.
And they're actually immune to lots of evidence.
When we get negative feedback, we still, the next time we're face with a certain context, tend to make the same errors.
And so this has been a real puzzle to me as a sort of scholar of human nature.
What I'm most curious about is, how is a species that's as smart as we are capable of such bad and such consistent errors all the time?
You know, we're the smartest thing out there, why can't we figure this out?
In some sense, where do our mistakes really come from?
And having thought about this a little bit, I see a couple different possibilities.
One possibility is, in some sense, it's not really our fault.
Because we're a smart species, we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super, super complicated, sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand, even though we've actually created them.
We create financial markets that are super complex.
We create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with.
And of course, if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it, in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up.
If this was the case, we'd have a really easy solution to the problem of human error.
We'd actually just say, okay, let's figure out the kinds of technologies we can't deal with, the kinds of environments that are bad -- get rid of those, design things better, and we should be the noble species that we expect ourselves to be.
But there's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying, which is, maybe it's not our environments that are messed up.
Maybe it's actually us that's designed badly.
This is a hint that I've gotten from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors.
And what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way, over and over again.
It feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways.
This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about, because, if it's us that's messed up, it's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it.
We might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone and try to design things around it.
So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at.
How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two?
What we need is a population that's basically smart, can make lots of decisions, but doesn't have access to any of the systems we have, any of the things that might mess us up -- no human technology, human culture, maybe even not human language.
And so this is why we turned to these guys here.
These are one of the guys I work with. This is a brown capuchin monkey.
These guys are New World primates, which means they broke off from the human branch about 35 million years ago.
This means that your great, great, great great, great, great -- with about five million "greats" in there -- grandmother was probably the same great, great, great, great grandmother with five million "greats" in there as Holly up here.
You know, so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant, but albeit evolutionary, relative.
The good news about Holly though is that she doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do.
You know, she's a smart, very cut creature, a primate as well, but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up.
So she's the perfect test case.
What if we put Holly into the same context as humans?
Does she make the same mistakes as us?
Does she not learn from them? And so on.
And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do.
My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago.
We said, all right, let's, you know, throw so problems at Holly, see if she messes these things up.
First problem is just, well, where should we start?
Because, you know, it's great for us, but bad for humans.
We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts.
You know, where are we actually going to start with this?
And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse, around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news, we said, hhmm, maybe we should actually start in the financial domain.
Maybe we should look at monkey's economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do.
Of course, that's when we hit a sort second problem -- a little bit more methodological -- which is that, maybe you guys don't know, but monkeys don't actually use money. I know, you haven't met them.
But this is why, you know, they're not in the queue behind you at the grocery store or the ATM -- you know, they don't do this stuff.
So now we faced, you know, a little bit of a problem here.
How are we actually going to ask monkeys about money if they don't actually use it?
So we said, well, maybe we should just, actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money.
So that's just what we did.
What you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of of non-human currency.
We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies, so we just called it a token.
But this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at Yale to actually use with humans, to actually buy different pieces of food.
It doesn't look like much -- in fact, it isn't like much.
Like most of our money, it's just a piece of metal.
As those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know, once you get home, it's actually pretty useless.
It was useless to the monkeys at first before they realized what they could do with it.
When we first gave it to them in their enclosures, they actually kind of picked them up, looked at them.
They were these kind of weird things.
But very quickly, the monkeys realized that they could actually hand these tokens over to different humans in the lab for some food.
And so you see one of our monkeys, Mayday, up here doing this.
This is A and B are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bit curious about these things -- doesn't know.
There's this waiting hand from a human experimenter, and Mayday quickly figures out, apparently the human wants this.
Hands it over, and then gets some food.
It turns out not just Mayday, all of our monkeys get good at trading tokens with human salesman.
So here's just a quick video of what this looks like.
Here's Mayday. She's going to be trading a token for some food and waiting happily and getting her food.
Here's Felix, I think. He's our alpha male; he's a kind of big guy.
But he too waits patiently, gets his food and goes on.
So the monkeys get really good at this.
They're surprisingly good at this with very little training.
We just allowed them to pick this up on their own.
The question is: is this anything like human money?
Is this a market at all, or did we just do a weird psychologist's trick by getting monkeys to do something, looking smart, but not really being smart.
And so we said, well, what would the monkeys spontaneously do if this was really their currency, if they were really using it like money?
Well, you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other.
You might have them start paying attention to price, paying attention to how much they buy -- sort of keeping track of their monkey token, as it were.
Do the monkeys do anything like this?
And so our monkey marketplace was born.
The way this works is that our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure.
When they get a hankering for some treats, we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market.
Upon entering the market -- it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets because, as the monkeys entered the door of the market, a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens so they could actually trade the tokens with one of these two guys here -- two different possible human salesmen that they could actually buy stuff from.
The salesmen were students from my lab.
They dressed differently; they were different people.
And over time, they did basically the same thing so the monkeys could learn, you know, who sold what at what price -- you know, who was reliable, who wasn't, and so on.
And you can see that each of the experimenters is actually holding up a little, yellow food dish.
and that's what the monkey can for a single token.
So everything costs one token, but as you can see, sometimes tokens buy more than others, sometimes more grapes than others.
So I'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like.
Here's a monkey-eye-view. Monkeys are shorter, so it's a little short.
But here's Honey.
She's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently.
All of a sudden the market opens. Here's her choice: one grapes or two grapes.
You can see Honey, very good market economist, goes with the guy who gives more.
She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two.
So not just Honey, most of the monkeys went with guys who had more.
Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food.
When we introduced sales, we saw the monkeys paid attention to that.
They really cared about their monkey token dollar.
The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists to actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools, they basically matched, not just qualitatively, but quantitatively with what we saw humans doing in a real market.
So much so that, if you saw the monkeys' numbers, you couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market.
And what we'd really thought we'd done is like we'd actually introduced something that, at least for the monkeys and us, works like a real financial currency.
Question is: do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do?
Well, we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might.
One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace was any evidence of saving -- you know, just like our own species.
The monkeys entered the market, spent their entire budget and then went back to everyone else.
The other thing we also spontaneously saw, embarrassingly enough, is spontaneous evidence of larceny.
The monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity -- from each other, often from us -- you know, things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing, but things we spontaneously saw.
So we said, this looks bad.
Can we actually see if the monkeys are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do?
One possibility is just kind of let the monkey financial system play out, you know, see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years.
We were a little impatient so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit.
So we said, let's actually give the monkeys the same kinds of problems that humans tend to get wrong in certain kinds of economic challenges, or certain kinds of economic experiments.
And so, since the best way to see how people go wrong is to actually do it yourself, I'm going to give you guys a quick experiment to sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action.
So imagine that right now I handed each and every one of you a thousand U.S. dollars -- so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills.
Take these, put it in your wallet and spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it.
Because it's yours now; you can buy whatever you want.
Donate it, take it, and so on.
Sounds great, but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money.
And here's your choice: you can either be risky, in which case I'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens.
If it comes up heads, you're going to get a thousand dollars more.
If it comes up tails, you get nothing.
So it's a chance to get more, but it's pretty risky.
Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure.
I'm just going to give you 500 bucks.
You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately.
So see what your intuition is here.
Most people actually go with the play-it-safe option.
Most people say, why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure?
This seems like a good bet. I'm going to go with that.
You might say, eh, that's not really irrational.
People are a little risk-averse. So what?
Well, the "so what?" comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently.
So now imagine that I give each and every one of you 2,000 dollars -- 20 crisp hundred dollar bills.
Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before.
Think about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet.
And now imagine that I have you make another choice But this time, it's a little bit worse.
Now, you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money, but you're going to get the same choice.
You can either take a risky loss -- so I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you're going to actually lose a lot.
If it comes up tails, you lose nothing, you're fine, get to keep the whole thing -- or you could play it safe, which means you have to reach back into your wallet and give me five of those $100 bills, for certain.
And I'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there.
So maybe you're having the same intuitions as the subjects that were actually tested in this, which is when presented with these options, people don't choose to play it safe.
They actually tend to go a little risky.
The reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situations the same choice.
It's a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000, or just 1,500 dollars with certainty.
But people's intuitions about how much risk to take varies depending on where they started with.
So what's going on?
Well, it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level.
One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms.
You really have to do work to figure out, well, one option's a thousand, 2,000; one is 1,500.
Instead, we find it very easy to think in very relative terms as options change from one time to another.
So we think of things as, "Oh, I'm going to get more," or "Oh, I'm going to get less."
This is all well and good, except that changes in different directions actually effect whether or not we think options are good or not.
And this leads to the second bias, which economists have called loss aversion.
The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red.
We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money.
And this means that sometimes we'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this.
What you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss.
That means when we're in a risk mindset -- excuse me, when we're in a loss mindset, we actually become more risky, which can actually be really worrying.
These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans.
They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer -- because they're evaluating them in relative terms.
They're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house -- because they don't want to sell at a loss.
The question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases.
If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market, would they do the same thing as people?
And so this is what we did, we gave the monkeys choices between guys who were safe -- they did the same thing every time -- or guys who were risky -- they did things differently half the time.
And then we gave them options that were bonuses -- like you guys did in the first scenario -- so they actually have a chance more, or pieces where they were experiencing losses -- they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got.
And so this is what this looks like.
We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen.
The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape, so it looks pretty good.
But they're going to give the monkeys bonuses.
The guy on the left is a safe bonus.
All the time, he adds one, to give the monkeys two.
The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus.
Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero.
Sometimes the monkeys get two extra.
For a big bonus, now they get three.
But this is the same choice you guys just faced.
Do the monkeys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial, or do they want to be risky and try to get a risky, but big, bonus, but risk the possibility of getting no bonus.
People here played it safe.
Turns out, the monkeys play it safe too.
Qualitatively and quantitatively, they choose exactly the same way as people, when tested in the same thing.
You might say, well, maybe the monkeys just don't like risk.
Maybe we should see how they do with losses.
And so we ran a second version of this.
Now, the monkeys meet two guys who aren't giving them bonuses; they're actually giving them less than they expect.
So they look like they're starting out with a big amount.
These are three grapes; the monkey's really psyched for this.
But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect.
They guy on the left is a safe loss.
Every single time, he's going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two.
the guy on the right is the risky loss.
Sometimes he gives no loss, so the monkeys are really psyched, but sometimes he actually gives a big loss, taking away two to give the monkeys only one.
And so what do the monkeys do?
Again, same choice; they can play it safe for always getting two grapes every single time, or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three.
The remarkable thing to us is that, when you give monkeys this choice, they do the same irrational thing that people do.
They actually become more risky depending on how the experimenters started.
This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too are evaluating things in relative terms and actually treating losses differently than they treat gains.
So what does all of this mean?
Well, what we've shown is that, first of all, we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency, and they do very similar things with it.
They do some of the smart things we do, some of the kind of not so nice things we do, like steal it and so on.
But they also do some of the irrational things we do.
They systematically get things wrong and in the same ways that we do.
This is the first take-home message of the Talk, which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought, oh, I'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser.
They're way cuter than the one at ... you know -- Don't do that; they're probably going to be just as dumb as the human one you already have.
So, you know, a little bad -- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
A little bad for monkey investors.
But of course, you know, the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too.
Because we've answered the question we started out with.
We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from.
And we started with the hope that maybe we can sort of tweak our financial institutions, tweak our technologies to make ourselves better.
But what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that.
In fact, they might be due to the very nature of our evolutionary history.
You know, maybe it's not just humans at the right side of this chain that's duncey.
Maybe it's sort of duncey all the way back.
And this, if we believe the capuchin monkey results, means that these duncey strategies might be 35 million years old.
That's a long time for a strategy to potentially get changed around -- really, really old.
What do we know about other old strategies like this?
Well, one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome.
You know, think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things, fatty things like cheesecake.
You can't just shut that off.
You can't just look at the dessert cart as say, "No, no, no. That looks disgusting to me."
We're just built differently.
We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after.
My guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving different financial decisions.
When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red, when you're watching your house price go down, you're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms.
This means that the biases that lead investors to do badly, that lead to the foreclosure crisis are going to be really hard to overcome.
So that's the bad news. The question is: is there any good news?
I'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news.
Well, the good news, I think, is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk, which is that humans are not only smart; we're really inspirationally smart to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom.
We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations -- you know, I flew over here in an airplane.
I didn't have to try to flap my wings.
I'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you.
I don't have to rely on my own near-sightedness.
We actually have all of these cases where we overcome our biological limitations through technology and other means, seemingly pretty easily.
But we have to recognize that we have those limitations.
And here's the rub.
It was Camus who once said that, "Man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is."
But the irony is that it might only be in recognizing our limitations that we can really actually overcome them.
The hope is that you all will think about your limitations, not necessarily as unovercomable, but to recognize them, accept them and then use the world of design to actually figure them out.
That might be the only way that we will really be able to achieve our own human potential and really be the noble species we hope to all be.
Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_green_why_we_should_build_wooden_skyscrapers.html</url>
This is my grandfather.
And this is my son.
My grandfather taught me to work with wood when I was a little boy, and he also taught me the idea that if you cut down a tree to turn it into something, honor that tree's life and make it as beautiful as you possibly can.
My little boy reminded me that for all the technology and all the toys in the world, sometimes just a small block of wood, if you stack it up tall, actually is an incredibly inspiring thing.
These are my buildings.
I build all around the world out of our office in Vancouver and New York.
And we build buildings of different sizes and styles and different materials, depending on where we are.
But wood is the material that I love the most, and I'm going to tell you the story about wood.
And part of the reason I love it is that every time people go into my buildings that are wood, I notice they react completely differently.
I've never seen anybody walk into one of my buildings and hug a steel or a concrete column, but I've actually seen that happen in a wood building.
I've actually seen how people touch the wood, and I think there's a reason for it.
Just like snowflakes, no two pieces of wood can ever be the same anywhere on Earth.
That's a wonderful thing.
I like to think that wood gives Mother Nature fingerprints in our buildings.
It's Mother Nature's fingerprints that make our buildings connect us to nature in the built environment.
Now, I live in Vancouver, near a forest that grows to 33 stories tall.
Down the coast here in California, the redwood forest grows to 40 stories tall.
But the buildings that we think about in wood are only four stories tall in most places on Earth.
Even building codes actually limit the ability for us to build much taller than four stories in many places, and that's true here in the United States.
Now there are exceptions, but there needs to be some exceptions, and things are going to change, I'm hoping.
And the reason I think that way is that today half of us live in cities, and that number is going to grow to 75 percent.
Cities and density mean that our buildings are going to continue to be big, and I think there's a role for wood to play in cities.
And I feel that way because three billion people in the world today, over the next 20 years, will need a new home.
That's 40 percent of the world that are going to need a new building built for them in the next 20 years.
Now, one in three people living in cities today actually live in a slum.
That's one billion people in the world live in slums.
A hundred million people in the world are homeless.
The scale of the challenge for architects and for society to deal with in building is to find a solution to house these people.
But the challenge is, as we move to cities, cities are built in these two materials, steel and concrete, and they're great materials.
They're the materials of the last century.
But they're also materials with very high energy and very high greenhouse gas emissions in their process.
Steel represents about three percent of man's greenhouse gas emissions, and concrete is over five percent.
So if you think about that, eight percent of our contribution to greenhouse gases today comes from those two materials alone.
We don't think about it a lot, and unfortunately, we actually don't even think about buildings, I think, as much as we should.
This is a U.S. statistic about the impact of greenhouse gases.
Almost half of our greenhouse gases are related to the building industry, and if we look at energy, it's the same story.
You'll notice that transportation's sort of second down that list, but that's the conversation we mostly hear about.
And although a lot of that is about energy, it's also so much about carbon.
The problem I see is that, ultimately, the clash of how we solve that problem of serving those three billion people that need a home, and climate change, are a head-on collision about to happen, or already happening.
That challenge means that we have to start thinking in new ways, and I think wood is going to be part of that solution, and I'm going to tell you the story of why.
As an architect, wood is the only material, big material, that I can build with that's already grown by the power of the sun.
When a tree grows in the forest and gives off oxygen and soaks up carbon dioxide, and it dies and it falls to the forest floor, it gives that carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere or into the ground.
If it burns in a forest fire, it's going to give that carbon back to the atmosphere as well.
But if you take that wood and you put it into a building or into a piece of furniture or into that wooden toy, it actually has an amazing capacity to store the carbon and provide us with a sequestration.
One cubic meter of wood will store one tonne of carbon dioxide.
Now our two solutions to climate are obviously to reduce our emissions and find storage.
Wood is the only major material building material I can build with that actually does both those two things.
So I believe that we have an ethic that the Earth grows our food, and we need to move to an ethic in this century that the Earth should grow our homes.
Now, how are we going to do that when we're urbanizing at this rate and we think about wood buildings only at four stories?
We need to reduce the concrete and steel and we need to grow bigger, and what we've been working on is 30-story tall buildings made of wood.
We've been engineering them with an engineer named Eric Karsh who works with me on it, and we've been doing this new work because there are new wood products out there for us to use, and we call them mass timber panels.
These are panels made with young trees, small growth trees, small pieces of wood glued together to make panels that are enormous: eight feet wide, 64 feet long, and of various thicknesses.
The way I describe this best, I've found, is to say that we're all used to two-by-four construction when we think about wood.
That's what people jump to as a conclusion.
Two-by-four construction is sort of like the little eight-dot bricks of Lego that we all played with as kids, and you can make all kinds of cool things out of Lego at that size, and out of two-by-fours.
But do remember when you were a kid, and you kind of sifted through the pile in your basement, and you found that big 24-dot brick of Lego, and you were kind of like, "Cool, this is awesome. I can build something really big, and this is going to be great."
That's the change.
Mass timber panels are those 24-dot bricks.
They're changing the scale of what we can do, and what we've developed is something we call FFTT, which is a Creative Commons solution to building a very flexible system of building with these large panels where we tilt up six stories at a time if we want to.
This animation shows you how the building goes together in a very simple way, but these buildings are available for architects and engineers now to build on for different cultures in the world, different architectural styles and characters.
In order for us to build safely, we've engineered these buildings, actually, to work in a Vancouver context, where we're a high seismic zone, even at 30 stories tall.
Now obviously, every time I bring this up, people even, you know, here at the conference, say, "Are you serious? Thirty stories? How's that going to happen?"
And there's a lot of really good questions that are asked and important questions that we spent quite a long time working on the answers to as we put together our report and the peer reviewed report.
I'm just going to focus on a few of them, and let's start with fire, because I think fire is probably the first one that you're all thinking about right now.
Fair enough.
And the way I describe it is this.
If I asked you to take a match and light it and hold up a log and try to get that log to go on fire, it doesn't happen, right? We all know that.
But to build a fire, you kind of start with small pieces of wood and you work your way up, and eventually you can add the log to the fire, it burns, but it burns slowly.
Well, mass timber panels, these new products that we're using, are much like the log.
It's hard to start them on fire, and when they do, they actually burn extraordinarily predictably, and we can use fire science in order to predict and make these buildings as safe as concrete and as safe as steel.
The next big issue, deforestation.
Eighteen percent of our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide is the result of deforestation.
The last thing we want to do is cut down trees.
Or, the last thing we want to do is cut down the wrong trees.
There are models for sustainable forestry that allow us to cut trees properly, and those are the only trees appropriate to use for these kinds of systems.
Now I actually think that these ideas will change the economics of deforestation.
In countries with deforestation issues, we need to find a way to provide better value for the forest and actually encourage people to make money through very fast growth cycles -- 10-, 12-, 15-year-old trees that make these products and allow us to build at this scale.
We've calculated a 20-story building: We'll grow enough wood in North America every 13 minutes.
That's how much it takes.
The carbon story here is a really good one.
If we built a 20-story building out of cement and concrete, the process would result in the manufacturing of that cement and 1,200 tonnes of carbon dioxide.
If we did it in wood, in this solution, we'd sequester about 3,100 tonnes, for a net difference of 4,300 tonnes.
That's the equivalent of about 900 cars removed from the road in one year.
Think back to that three billion people that need a new home, and maybe this is a contributor to reducing.
We're at the beginning of a revolution, I hope, in the way we build, because this is the first new way to build a skyscraper in probably 100 years or more.
But the challenge is changing society's perception of possibility, and it's a huge challenge.
The engineering is, truthfully, the easy part of this.
And the way I describe it is this.
The first skyscraper, technically -- and the definition of a skyscraper is 10 stories tall, believe it or not — but the first skyscraper was this one in Chicago, and people were terrified to walk underneath this building.
But only four years after it was built, Gustave Eiffel was building the Eiffel Tower, and as he built the Eiffel Tower, he changed the skylines of the cities of the world, changed and created a competition between places like New York City and Chicago, where developers started building bigger and bigger buildings and pushing the envelope up higher and higher with better and better engineering.
We built this model in New York, actually, as a theoretical model on the campus of a technical university soon to come, and the reason we picked this site to just show you what these buildings may look like, because the exterior can change.
It's really just the structure that we're talking about.
The reason we picked it is because this is a technical university, and I believe that wood is the most technologically advanced material I can build with.
It just happens to be that Mother Nature holds the patent, and we don't really feel comfortable with it.
But that's the way it should be, nature's fingerprints in the built environment.
I'm looking for this opportunity to create an Eiffel Tower moment, we call it.
Buildings are starting to go up around the world.
There's a building in London that's nine stories, a new building that just finished in Australia that I believe is 10 or 11.
We're starting to push the height up of these wood buildings, and we're hoping, and I'm hoping, that my hometown of Vancouver actually potentially announces the world's tallest at around 20 stories in the not-so-distant future.
That Eiffel Tower moment will break the ceiling, these arbitrary ceilings of height, and allow wood buildings to join the competition.
And I believe the race is ultimately on.
Thank you.

So when the White House was built in the early 19th century, it was an open house.
Neighbors came and went. Under President Adams, a local dentist happened by.
He wanted to shake the President's hand.
The President dismissed the Secretary of State, whom he was conferring with, and asked the dentist if he would remove a tooth.
Later, in the 1850s, under President Pierce, he was known to have remarked — probably the only thing he's known for — when a neighbor passed by and said, "I'd love to see the beautiful house," and Pierce said to him, "Why my dear sir, of course you may come in.
This isn't my house. It is the people's house."
Well, when I got to the White House in the beginning of 2009, at the start of the Obama Administration, the White House was anything but open.
Bomb blast curtains covered my windows.
We were running Windows 2000.
Social media were blocked at the firewall.
We didn't have a blog, let alone a dozen twitter accounts like we have today.
I came in to become the head of Open Government, to take the values and the practices of transparency, participation and collaboration, and instill them into the way that we work, to open up government, to work with people.
Now one of the things that we know is that companies are very good at getting people to work together in teams and in networks to make very complex products, like cars and computers, and the more complex the products are a society creates, the more successful the society is over time.
Companies make goods, but governments, they make public goods. They work on the cure for cancer and educating our children and making roads, but we don't have institutions that are particularly good at this kind of complexity. We don't have institutions that are good at bringing our talents to bear, at working with us in this kind of open and collaborative way.
So when we wanted to create our Open Government policy, what did we do? We wanted, naturally, to ask public sector employees how we should open up government.
Turns out that had never been done before.
We wanted to ask members of the public to help us come up with a policy, not after the fact, commenting on a rule after it's written, the way is typically the case, but in advance. There was no legal precedent, no cultural precedent, no technical way of doing this.
In fact, many people told us it was illegal.
Here's the crux of the obstacle.
Governments exist to channel the flow of two things, really, values and expertise to and from government and to and from citizens to the end of making decisions.
But the way that our institutions are designed, in our rather 18th-century, centralized model, is to channel the flow of values through voting, once every four years, once every two years, at best, once a year. This is a rather anemic and thin way, in this era of social media, for us to actually express our values.
Today we have technology that lets us express ourselves a great deal, perhaps a little too much.
Then in the 19th century, we layer on the concept of bureaucracy and the administrative state to help us govern complex and large societies.
But we've centralized these bureaucracies.
We've entrenched them. And we know that the smartest person always works for someone else.
We need to only look around this room to know that expertise and intelligence is widely distributed in society, and not limited simply to our institutions.
Scientists have been studying in recent years the phenomenon that they often describe as flow, that the design of our systems, whether natural or social, channel the flow of whatever runs through them.
So a river is designed to channel the flow of water, and the lightning bolt that comes out of a cloud channels the flow of electricity, and a leaf is designed to channel the flow of nutrients to the tree, sometimes even having to route around an obstacle, but to get that nutrition flowing.
The same can be said for our social systems, for our systems of government, where, at the very least, flow offers us a helpful metaphor for understanding what the problem is, what's really broken, and the urgent need that we have, that we all feel today, to redesign the flow of our institutions.
We live in a Cambrian era of big data, of social networks, and we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions that are actually quite recent.
Think about it: What other business do you know, what other sector of the economy, and especially one as big as the public sector, that doesn't seek to reinvent its business model on a regular basis?
Sure, we invest plenty in innovation. We invest in broadband and science education and science grants, but we invest far too little in reinventing and redesigning the institutions that we have.
Now, it's very easy to complain, of course, about partisan politics and entrenched bureaucracy, and we love to complain about government. It's a perennial pastime, especially around election time, but the world is complex. We soon will have 10 billion people, many of whom will lack basic resources.
So complain as we might, what actually can replace what we have today?
What comes the day after the Arab Spring?
Well, one attractive alternative that obviously presents itself to us is that of networks. Right? Networks like Facebook and Twitter. They're lean. They're mean.
You've got 3,000 employees at Facebook governing 900 million inhabitants.
We might even call them citizens, because they've recently risen up to fight against legislative incursion, and the citizens of these networks work together to serve each other in great ways.
But private communities, private, corporate, privatizing communities, are not bottom-up democracies.
They cannot replace government.
Friending someone on Facebook is not complex enough to do the hard work of you and I collaborating with each other and doing the hard work of governance.
But social media do teach us something.
Why is Twitter so successful? Because it opens up its platform.
It opens up the API to allow hundreds of thousands of new applications to be built on top of it, so that we can read and process information in new and exciting ways.
We need to think about how to open up the API of government, and the way that we're going to do that, the next great superpower is going to be the one who can successfully combine the hierarchy of institution -- because we have to maintain those public values, we have to coordinate the flow -- but with the diversity and the pulsating life and the chaos and the excitement of networks, all of us working together to build these new innovations on top of our institutions, to engage in the practice of governance.
We have a precedent for this. Good old Henry II here, in the 12th century, invented the jury.
Powerful, practical, palpable model for handing power from government to citizens.
Today we have the opportunity, and we have the imperative, to create thousands of new ways of interconnecting between networks and institutions, thousands of new kinds of juries: the citizen jury, the Carrotmob, the hackathon, we are just beginning to invent the models by which we can cocreate the process of governance.
Now, we don't fully have a picture of what this will look like yet, but we're seeing pockets of evolution emerging all around us -- maybe not even evolution, I'd even start to call it a revolution -- in the way that we govern.
Some of it's very high-tech, and some of it is extremely low-tech, such as the project that MKSS is running in Rajasthan, India, where they take the spending data of the state and paint it on 100,000 village walls, and then invite the villagers to come and comment who is on the government payroll, who's actually died, what are the bridges that have been built to nowhere, and to work together through civic engagement to save real money and participate and have access to that budget.
But it's not just about policing government.
It's also about creating government.
Spacehive in the U.K. is engaging in crowd-funding, getting you and me to raise the money to build the goalposts and the park benches that will actually allow us to deliver better services in our communities.
No one is better at this activity of actually getting us to engage in delivering services, sometimes where none exist, than Ushahidi.
Created after the post-election riots in Kenya in 2008, this crisis-mapping website and community is actually able to crowdsource and target the delivery of better rescue services to people trapped under the rubble, whether it's after the earthquakes in Haiti, or more recently in Italy.
And the Red Cross too is training volunteers and Twitter is certifying them, not simply to supplement existing government institutions, but in many cases, to replace them.
Now what we're seeing lots of examples of, obviously, is the opening up of government data, not enough examples of this yet, but we're starting to see this practice of people creating and generating innovative applications on top of government data.
There's so many examples I could have picked, and I selected this one of Jon Bon Jovi. Some of you may or may not know that he runs a soup kitchen in New Jersey, where he caters to and serves the homeless and particularly homeless veterans.
In February, he approached the White House, and said, "I would like to fund a prize to create scalable national applications, apps, that will help not only the homeless but those who deliver services [to] them to do so better."
February 2012 to June of 2012, the finalists are announced in the competition.
Can you imagine, in the bureaucratic world of yesteryear, getting anything done in a four-month period of time?
You can barely fill out the forms in that amount of time, let alone generate real, palpable innovations that improve people's lives.
And I want to be clear to mention that this open government revolution is not about privatizing government, because in many cases what it can do when we have the will to do so is to deliver more progressive and better policy than the regulations and the legislative and litigation-oriented strategies by which we make policy today.
In the State of Texas, they regulate 515 professions, from well-driller to florist.
Now, you can carry a gun into a church in Dallas, but do not make a flower arrangement without a license, because that will land you in jail.
So what is Texas doing? They're asking you and me, using online policy wikis, to help not simply get rid of burdensome regulations that impede entrepreneurship, but to replace those regulations with more innovative alternatives, sometimes using transparency in the creation of new iPhone apps that will allows us both to protect consumers and the public and to encourage economic development.
That is a nice sideline of open government.
It's not only the benefits that we've talked about with regard to development. It's the economic benefits and the job creation that's coming from this open innovation work.
Sberbank, the largest and oldest bank in Russia, largely owned by the Russian government, has started practicing crowdsourcing, engaging its employees and citizens in the public in developing innovations.
Last year they saved a billion dollars, 30 billion rubles, from open innovation, and they're pushing radically the extension of crowdsourcing, not only from banking, but into the public sector.
And we see lots of examples of these innovators using open government data, not simply to make apps, but then to make companies and to hire people to build them working with the government.
So a lot of these innovations are local.
In San Ramon, California, they published an iPhone app in which they allow you or me to say we are certified CPR-trained, and then when someone has a heart attack, a notification goes out so that you can rush over to the person over here and deliver CPR.
The victim who receives bystander CPR is more than twice as likely to survive.
"There is a hero in all of us," is their slogan.
But it's not limited to the local.
British Columbia, Canada, is publishing a catalogue of all the ways that its residents and citizens can engage with the state in the cocreation of governance.
Let me be very clear, and perhaps controversial, that open government is not about transparent government.
Simply throwing data over the transom doesn't change how government works.
It doesn't get anybody to do anything with that data to change lives, to solve problems, and it doesn't change government.
What it does is it creates an adversarial relationship between civil society and government over the control and ownership of information.
And transparency, by itself, is not reducing the flow of money into politics, and arguably, it's not even producing accountability as well as it might if we took the next step of combining participation and collaboration with transparency to transform how we work.
We're going to see this evolution really in two phases, I think. The first phase of the open government revolution is delivering better information from the crowd into the center.
Starting in 2005, and this is how this open government work in the U.S. really got started, I was teaching a patent law class to my students and explaining to them how a single person in the bureaucracy has the power to make a decision about which patent application becomes the next patent, and therefore monopolizes for 20 years the rights over an entire field of inventive activity.
Well, what did we do? We said, we can make a website, we can make an expert network, a social network, that would connect the network to the institution to allow scientists and technologists to get better information to the patent office to aid in making those decisions.
We piloted the work in the U.S. and the U.K. and Japan and Australia, and now I'm pleased to report that the United States Patent Office will be rolling out universal, complete, and total openness, so that all patent applications will now be open for citizen participation, beginning this year.
The second phase of this evolution — Yeah.
They deserve a hand.
The first phase is in getting better information in.
The second phase is in getting decision-making power out.
Participatory budgeting has long been practiced in Porto Alegre, Brazil.
They're just starting it in the 49th Ward in Chicago.
Russia is using wikis to get citizens writing law together, as is Lithuania. When we start to see power over the core functions of government — spending, legislation, decision-making — then we're well on our way to an open government revolution.
There are many things that we can do to get us there.
Obviously opening up the data is one, but the important thing is to create lots more -- create and curate -- lots more participatory opportunities.
Hackathons and mashathons and working with data to build apps is an intelligible way for people to engage and participate, like the jury is, but we're going to need lots more things like it.
And that's why we need to start with our youngest people.
We've heard talk here at TED about people biohacking and hacking their plants with Arduino, and Mozilla is doing work around the world in getting young people to build websites and make videos.
When we start by teaching young people that we live, not in a passive society, a read-only society, but in a writable society, where we have the power to change our communities, to change our institutions, that's when we begin to really put ourselves on the pathway towards this open government innovation, towards this open government movement, towards this open government revolution.
So let me close by saying that I think the important thing for us to do is to talk about and demand this revolution.
We don't have words, really, to describe it yet.
Words like equality and fairness and the traditional elections, democracy, these are not really great terms yet.
They're not fun enough. They're not exciting enough to get us engaged in this tremendous opportunity that awaits us. But I would argue that if we want to see the kinds of innovations, the hopeful and exciting innovations that we hear talked about here at TED, in clean energy, in clean education, in development, if we want to see those adopted and we want to see those scaled, we want to see them become the governance of tomorrow, then we must all participate, then we must get involved.
We must open up our institutions, and like the leaf, we must let the nutrients flow throughout our body politic, throughout our culture, to create open institutions to create a stronger democracy, a better tomorrow.
Thank you.

Compassion: what does it look like?
Come with me to 915 South Bloodworth Street in Raleigh, North Carolina, where I grew up.
If you come in you will see us: evening time, at table -- set for ten but not always all seats filled -- at the point when dinner is ready to be served.
Since mom had eight kids, sometimes she said she couldn't tell who was who and where they were.
Before we could eat, she would ask, "Are all the children in?"
And if someone happened to be missing, we would have to, we say, "Fix a plate" for that person, put it in the oven, then we could say grace, and we could eat.
Also, while we were at the table, there was a ritual in our family: when something significant had happened for any one of us -- whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA, or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination, or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent -- the ritual at the family was, once the announcement is made, we must take five, ten minutes to do what we call "make over" that person -- that is, to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way.
For when one is honored, all are honored.
Also, we had to make a report on our extended "visited" members, that is, extended members of the family, sick and elderly, shut in.
My task was, at least once a week, to visit Mother Lassiter who lived on East Street, Mother Williamson who lived on Bledsoe Avenue, and Mother Lathers who lived on Oberlin Road.
Why? Because they were old and infirm, and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything.
For mom said, "To be family, is to care and share and to look out for one another.
They are our family."
And, of course, sometimes there was a bonus for going.
They would offer sweets or money.
Mom says, "If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them, you must always say, 'Nothing.' And if they insist, say, 'Whatever you mind to give me.'" This was the nature of being at that table.
In fact, she indicated that if we would do that, not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family, but she said, "Even God will smile, and when God smiles, there is peace, and justice, and joy."
So, at the table at 915, I learned something about compassion.
Of course, it was a minister's family, so we had to add God into it.
And so, I came to think that mama eternal, mama eternal, is always wondering: Are all the children in?
And if we had been faithful in caring and sharing, we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world.
Now, it was not always wonderful at that table.
Let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion.
It was Christmas, and at our family, oh, what a morning.
Christmas morning, where we open up our gifts, where we have special prayers, and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols. It was a very intimate moment.
In fact, you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing, and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed, except that daddy messed it up.
There was a member of his staff who did not have any place on that particular Christmas to celebrate.
And daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration.
We thought he must be out of his mind.
This is our time. This is intimate time.
This is when we can just be who we are, and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on, while we are still in our PJs.
Why would daddy bring Elder Revels?
Any other time, but not to the Christmas celebration.
And mom overheard us and said, "Well, you know what? If you really understand the nature of this celebration, it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love.
That's what the celebration is all about.
It's time to make space, to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community."
So, we sucked up.
But growing up at 915, compassion was not a word to be debated; it was a sensibility to how we are together.
We are sisters and brothers united together.
And, like Chief Seattle said, "We did not spin the web of life.
We're all strands in it.
And whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves."
Now that's compassion.
So, let me tell you, I kind of look at the world this way.
I see pictures, and something says, "Now, that's compassion."
A harvested field of grain, with some grain in the corners, reminding me of the Hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest, but you must always leave some on the edges, just in case there's someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture.
Talk about a picture of compassion.
I see -- always, it stirs my heart -- a picture of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
walking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel and maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled, walking across the bridge and going into Selma.
Just a photograph.
Arm in arm for struggle.
Suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of a sense of unity of being.
So, there's another picture. Here, this one. I really do like this picture.
When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated, that day, everybody in my community was upset.
You heard about riots all across the land.
Bobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis.
This is the picture. They said, "It's going to be too volatile for you to go."
He insisted, "I must go."
So, sitting on a flatbed truck, the elders of the community are there, and Bobby stands up and says to the people, "I have bad news for you.
Some of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated.
I know that you are angry, and I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge. But," he said, "what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel.
Because I had someone dear to me snatched away.
I know how you feel."
And he said, "I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did.
I allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while, and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world, and we can do that together."
That's a picture. Compassion? I think I see it.
I saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor, and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world.
He asked them to give a message, and they each read in their own language a central affirmation, and that was some version of the golden rule: "As you would that others would do unto you, do also unto them."
Twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message.
We are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself.
One more picture while I'm stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church: 9/11. Last night at Chagrin Fall, a newspaperman and a television guy said, "That evening, when a service was held at the Riverside Church, we carried it on our station in this city.
It was," he said, "one of the most powerful moments of life together.
We were all suffering.
But you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come, and you invited them.
'Find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated, when we have been despised and rejected.' And they all spoke out of their own traditions, a word about the healing power of solidarity, one with the other."
I developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature, but I became a preacher.
Now, as a preacher, I got a job. I got to preach the stuff, but I got to do it too.
Or, as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks, "Some people preach the Gospel.
I have to tangibilitate the Gospel."
So, the real issue is: How do you tangibilitate compassion?
How do you make it real?
My faith has constantly lifted up the ideal, and challenged me when I fell beneath it.
In my tradition, there is a gift that we have made to other traditions -- to everybody around the world who knows the story of the "Good Samaritan."
Many people think of it primarily in terms of charity, random acts of kindness.
But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly, you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable.
The question was: "What is the greatest commandment?"
And, according to Jesus, the word comes forth, "You must love yourself, you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul, and your neighbor as yourself."
And then the person asked, "Well, what do you mean, 'neighbor?'" And he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves, and how religious authorities went the other way, and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way; but an unsuspecting, despised person came along, saw the man in need, provided oil and wine for his wounds, put him on his own transportation, and took him to the inn and asked the innkeeper, "Take care of him."
And he said, "Here, this is the initial investment, but if needs continue, make sure that you provide them.
And whatever else is needed, I will provide it and pay for it when I return."
This always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan.
A Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and charity, but one who provides a system of sustained care -- I like that, 'a system of sustained care ' -- in the inn, take care.
I think maybe it's one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary -- that all God's children would have their needs cared for, so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks, "In regards to health, are all the children in?" And we could say yes.
Oh, what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion.
I recall that my work as a pastor has always involved caring for their spiritual needs; being concerned for housing, for healthcare, for the prisoners, for the infirm, for children -- even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off, where they are going.
To be a pastor is to care for these individual needs.
But now, to be a Good Samaritan -- and I always say, and to be a good American -- for me, is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care.
Compassion takes on a corporate dynamic.
I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family, that family together that understands the nature of our unity.
We are one people together.
So, let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion, and why I think it is so important that right at this point in history.
We would decide to establish this charter of compassion.
The reason it's important is because this is a very special time in history.
It is the time that, biblically, we would speak of as the day, or the year, of God's favor.
This is a season of grace.
Unusual things are beginning to happen.
Please pardon me, as a black man, for celebrating that the election of Obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor.
And yet, there is so much more that needs to be done.
We need to bring health and food and education and respect for all God's citizens, all God's children, remembering mama eternal.
Now, let me close my comments by telling you that whenever I feel something very deeply, it usually takes the form of verse.
And so I want to close with a little song.
I close with this song -- it's a children's song -- because we are all children at the table of mama eternal.
And if mama eternal has taught us correctly, this song will make sense, not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering, but to all who sign the charter for compassion.
And this is why we do it.
The song says, "I made heaven so happy today, Receiving God's love and giving it away When I looked up, heaven smiled at me Now, I'm so happy. Can't you see? I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? Sharing makes me happy, makes heaven happy too I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? Let me share my happy loving smile with you. That's compassion.

We conventionally divide space into private and public realms, and we know these legal distinctions very well because we've become experts at protecting our private property and private space.
But we're less attuned to the nuances of the public.
What translates generic public space into qualitative space?
I mean, this is something that our studio has been working on for the past decade.
And we're doing this through some case studies.
A large chunk of our work has been put into transforming this neglected industrial ruin into a viable post-industrial space that looks forward and backward And another huge chunk of our work has gone into making relevant a site that's grown out of sync with its time.
We've been working on democratizing Lincoln Center for a public that doesn't usually have $300 to spend on an opera ticket.
So we've been eating, drinking, thinking, living public space for quite a long time.
And it's taught us really one thing, and that is to truly make good public space, you have to erase the distinctions between architecture, urbanism, landscape, media design and so on.
It really goes beyond distinction.
Now we're moving onto Washington, D.C.
and we're working on another transformation, and that is for the existing Hirshhorn Museum that's sited on the most revered public space in America, the National Mall.
The Mall is a symbol of American democracy.
And what's fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing, it's not an image, it's not an artifact, actually it's a space, and it's kind of just defined by a line of buildings on either side.
It's a space where citizens can voice their discontent and show their power.
It's a place where pivotal moments in American history have taken place.
And they're inscribed in there forever -- like the march on Washington for jobs and freedom and the great speech that Martin Luther King gave there.
The Vietnam protests, the commemoration of all that died in the pandemic of AIDS, the march for women's reproductive rights, right up until almost the present.
The Mall is the greatest civic stage in this country for dissent.
And it's synonymous with free speech, even if you're not sure what it is that you have to say.
It may just be a place for civic commiseration.
There is a huge disconnect, we believe, between the communicative and discursive space of the Mall and the museums that line it to either side.
And that is that those museums are usually passive, they have passive relationships between the museum as the presenter and the audience, as the receiver of information.
And so you can see dinosaurs and insects and collections of locomotives and all of that, but you're really not involved; you're being talked to.
When Richard Koshalek took over as director of the Hirshhorn in 2009, he was determined to take advantage of the fact that this museum was sited at the most unique place: at the seat of power in the U.S.
And while art and politics are inherently and implicitly together always and all the time, there could be some very special relationship that could be forged here in its uniqueness.
The question is, is it possible ultimately for art to insert itself into the dialogue of national and world affairs?
And could the museum be an agent of cultural diplomacy?
There are over 180 embassies in Washington D.C.
There are over 500 think tanks.
There should be a way of harnessing all of that intellectual and global energy into, and somehow through, the museum.
There should be some kind of brain trust.
So the Hirshhorn, as we began to think about it, and as we evolved the mission, with Richard and his team -- it's really his life blood.
But beyond exhibiting contemporary art, the Hirshhorn will become a public forum, a place of discourse for issues around arts, culture, politics and policy.
It would have the global reach of the World Economic Forum.
It would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference.
It would have the informality of the town square.
And for this new initiative, the Hirshhorn would have to expand or appropriate a site for a contemporary, deployable structure.
This is it. This is the Hirshhorn -- so a 230-foot-diameter concrete doughnut designed in the early '70s by Gordon Bunshaft.
It's hulking, it's silent, it's cloistered, it's arrogant, it's a design challenge.
Architects love to hate it.
One redeeming feature is it's lifted up off the ground and it's got this void, and it's got an empty core kind of in the spirit and that facade very much corporate and federal style.
And around that space, the ring is actually galleries.
Very, very difficult to mount shows in there.
When the Hirshhorn opened, Ada Louise Huxstable, the New York Times critic, had some choice words: "Neo-penitentiary modern."
"A maimed monument and a maimed Mall for a maimed collection."
Almost four decades later, how will this building expand for a new progressive program?
Where would it go?
It can't go in the Mall.
There is no space there.
It can't go in the courtyard.
It's already taken up by landscape and by sculptures.
Well there's always the hole.
But how could it take the space of that hole and not be buried in it invisibly?
How could it become iconic?
And what language would it take?
The Hirshhorn sits among the Mall's momumental institutions.
Most are neoclassical, heavy and opaque, made of stone or concrete.
And the question is, if one inhabits that space, what is the material of the Mall?
It has to be different from the buildings there.
It has to be something entirely different.
It has to be air.
In our imagination, it has to be light.
It has to be ephemeral. It has to be formless.
And it has to be free.
So this is the big idea.
It's a giant airbag.
The expansion takes the shape of its container and it oozes out wherever it can -- the top and sides.
But more poetically, we like to think of the structure as inhaling the democratic air of the Mall, bringing it into itself.
The before and the after.
It was dubbed "the bubble" by the press.
That was the lounge.
It's basically one big volume of air that just oozes out in every direction.
The membrane is translucent.
It's made of silcon-coated glass fiber.
And it's inflated twice a year for one month at a time.
This is the view from the inside.
So you might have been wondering how in the world did we get this approved by the federal government.
It had to be approved by actually two agencies.
And one is there to preserve the dignity and sanctity of the Mall.
I blush whenever I show this.
It is yours to interpret.
But one thing I can say is that it's a combination of iconoclasm and adoration.
There was also some creative interpretation involved.
The Congressional Buildings Act of 1910 limits the height of buildings in D.C.
to 130 feet, except for spires, towers, domes and minarettes.
This pretty much exempts monuments of the church and state.
And the bubble is 153 ft.
That's the Pantheon next to it.
It's about 1.2 million cubic feet of compressed air.
And so we argued it on the merits of being a dome.
So there it is, very stately, among all the stately buildings in the Mall.
And while this Hirshhorn is not landmarked, it's very, very historically sensitive.
And so we couldn't really touch its surfaces.
We couldn't leave any traces behind.
So we strained it from the edges, and we held it by cables.
It's a study of some bondage techniques, which are actually very, very important because it's hit by wind all the time.
There's one permanent steel ring at the top, but it can't be seen from any vantage point on the Mall.
There are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit.
It glows from within, it's translucent.
But it can't be more lit than the Capitol or some of the monuments.
So it's down the hierarchy on lighting.
So it comes to the site twice a year.
It's taken off the delivery truck.
It's hoisted.
And then it's inflated with this low-pressure air.
And then it's restrained with the cables.
And then it's ballasted with water at the very bottom.
This is a very strange moment where we were asked by the bureaucracy at the Mall how much time would it take to install.
And we said, well the first erection would take one week.
And they really connected with that idea.
And then it was really easy all the way through.
So we didn't really have that many hurdles, I have to say, with the government and all the authorities.
But some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones.
This is the warp and weft.
This is a point cloud.
There are extreme pressures.
This is a very, very unusual building in that there's no gravity load, but there's load in every direction.
And I'm just going to zip through these slides.
And this is the space in action.
So flexible interior for discussions, just like this, but in the round -- luminous and reconfigurable.
Could be used for anything, for performances, films, for installations.
And the very first program will be one of cultural dialogue and diplomacy organized in partnership with the Council on Foreign Relations.
Form and content are together here.
The bubble is an anti-monument.
The ideals of participatory democracy are represented through suppleness rather than rigidity.
Art and politics occupy an ambiguous site outside the museum walls, but inside of the museum's core, blending its air with the democratic air of the Mall.
And the bubble will inflate hopefully for the first time at the end of 2013.
Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/emmanuel_jal_the_music_of_a_war_child.html</url>
I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal.
And I come from a long way.
I've been telling a story that has been so painful for me.
It's been a tough journey for me, traveling the world, telling my story in form of a book.
And also telling it like now.
And also, the easiest one was when I was doing it in form of a music.
So I have branded myself as a war child.
I'm doing this because of an old lady in my village now, who have lost her children.
There is no newspaper to cover her pain, and what she wants to change in this society.
And I'm doing it for a young man who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice because he can't write.
Or there is no Internet, like Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, for them to talk.
Also one thing that kept me pushing this story, this painful stories out, the dreams I have, sometimes, is like the voices of the dead, that I have seen would tell me, "Don't give up. Keep on going."
Because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it, because I didn't know what I was putting myself into.
Well I was born in the most difficult time, when my country was at war.
I saw my village burned down.
The world that meant a lot to me, I saw it vanish in my face.
I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five.
My mother was claimed by the war.
My brothers and sisters were scattered.
And up to now, me and my father were detached and I still have issues with him.
Seeing people die every day, my mother crying, it's like I was raised in a violence.
And that made me call myself a war child.
And not only that, when I was eight I became a child soldier.
I didn't know what was the war for.
But one thing I knew was an image that I saw that stuck in my head.
When I went to the training camp I say, "I want to kill as many Muslims, and as many Arabs, as possible."
The training wasn't easy, but that was the driving force, because I wanted to revenge for my family.
I wanted to revenge for my village.
Luckily now things have changed because I came to discover the truth.
What was actually killing us wasn't the Muslims, wasn't the Arabs.
It was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system, and using religion to get what they want to get out of us, which is the oil, the diamond, the gold and the land.
So realizing the truth gave me a position to choose: should I continue to hate, or let it go?
So I happened to forgive. Now I sing music with the Muslims. I dance with them.
I even had a movie out called "War Child," funded by Muslim people.
So that pain has gone out.
But my story is huge.
So I'm just going to go into a different step now, which is easier for me.
I'm going to give you poem called "Forced to Sin," which is from my album "War Child."
I talk about my story.
One of the journey that I tread when I was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food and we were like around 400.
And only 16 people survived that journey.
So I hope you're going to hear this.
My dreams are like torment.
My every moment.
Voices in my brain, of friends that was slain.
Friends like Lual who died by my side, of starvation.
In the burning jungle, and the desert plain.
Next was I, but Jesus heard my cry.
As I was tempted to eat the rotten flesh of my comrade, he gave me comfort.
We used to raid villages, stealing chickens, goats and sheeps, anything we could eat.
I knew it was rude, but we needed food.
And therefore I was forced to sin, forced to sin to make a living, forced to sin to make a living.
Sometimes you gotta lose to win.
Never give up. Never give in.
Left home at the age of seven.
One year later, live with an AK-47 by my side.
Slept with one eye open wide.
Run, duck, play dead and hide.
I've seen my people die like flies.
But I've never seen a dead body, at least one that I've killed.
But still as I wonder, I won't go under.
Guns barking like lightning and thunder.
As a child so young and tender, Words I can't forget I still remember.
I saw sergeant command raising his hand, no retreat, no surrender.
I carry the banner of the trauma.
War child, child without a mama, still fighting in the saga.
Yet as I wage this new war I'm not alone in this drama.
No sit or stop, as I reach for the top I'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop.
I'm on a fight, day and night.
Sometime I do wrong in order to make things right.
It's like I'm living a dream.
First time I'm feeling like a human being.
Ah! The children of Darfur.
Your empty bellies on the telly and now it's you that I'm fighting for.
Left home.
Don't even know the day I'll ever return.
My country is war-torn.
Music I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns.
So many people die that I don't even cry no more.
Ask God question, what am I here for.
And why are my people poor.
And why, why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write, I was learning how to fight.
I ate snails, vultures, rabbits, snakes, and anything that had life.
I was ready to eat.
I know it's a shame. But who is to be blamed?
That's my story shared in the form of a lesson.
Thank you.
What energized me and kept me going is the music I do.
I never saw anybody to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy.
So the music had been my therapy for me.
It's been where I actually see heaven, where I can be happy, where I can be a child again, in dances, through music.
So one thing I know about music: music is the only thing that has power to enter your cell system, your mind, your heart, influence your soul and your spirit, and can even influence the way you live without even you knowing.
Music is the only thing that can make you want to wake up your bed and shake your leg, without even wanting to do it.
And so the power music has I normally compare to the power love when love doesn't see a color.
You know, if you fall in love with a frog, that's it.
One testimony about how I find music is powerful is when I was still a soldier back then.
I hated the people in the north.
But I don't know why I don't hate their music.
So we party and dance to their music.
And one thing that shocked me is one day they brought an Arab musician to come and entertain the soldiers.
And I almost broke my leg dancing to his music.
But I had this question.
So now I'm doing music so I know what the power of music is.
So what's happening here?
I've been in a painful journey.
Today is day number 233 in which I only eat dinner.
I don't eat breakfast. No lunch.
And I've done a campaign called Lose to Win.
Where I'm losing so that I could win the battle that I'm fighting now.
So my breakfast, my lunch, I donate it to a charity that I founded because we want to build a school in Sudan.
And I'm doing this because also it's a normal thing in my home, people eat one meal a day.
Here I am in the West. I choose not to.
So in my village now, kids there, they normally listen to BBC, or any radio, and they are waiting to know, the day Emmanuel will eat his breakfast it means he got the money to build our school.
And so I made a commitment. I say, "I'm gonna not eat my breakfast."
I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month, but I've been humbled.
So it's taken me 232 days.
And I said, "No stop until we get it."
And like it's been done on Facebook, MySpace.
The people are giving three dollars.
The lowest amount we ever got was 20 cents.
Somebody donated 20 cents online.
I don't know how they did it.
But that moved me.
And so, the importance of education to me is what I'm willing to die for.
I'm willing to die for this, because I know what it can do to my people.
Education enlighten your brain, give you so many chances, and you're able to survive.
As a nation we have been crippled.
For so many years we have fed on aid.
You see a 20-years-old, 30-years-old families in a refugee camps.
They only get the food that drops from the sky, from the U.N.
So these people, you're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid.
If anybody want to help us this is what we need.
Give us tools. Give the farmers tools.
It's rain. Africa is fertile. They can grow the crops.
Invest in education.
Education so that we have strong institution that can create a revolution to change everything.
Because we have all those old men that are creating wars in Africa. They will die soon.
But if you invest in education then we'll be able to change Africa.
That's what I'm asking.
So in order to do that, I founded a charter called Gua Africa, where we put kids in school.
And now we have a couple in university.
We have like 40 kids, ex-child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support.
And I said "I'm going to put it in practice."
And with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things.
That's what I want to do to change, to make a difference in the world.
Well now, my time is going, so I want to sing a song.
But I'll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a British aid worker called Emma McCune that made it possible for me to be here.
I'm gonna sing this song, just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference.
She came to my country and saw the importance of education.
She said the only way to help Sudan is to invest in the women, educating them, educating the children, so that they could come and create a revolution in this complex society.
So she even ended up marrying a commander from the SPLA.
And she rescued over 150 child soldiers.
One of them happened to be me now.
And so at this moment I want to ask to celebrate Emma with me.
Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma?
Audience: Yes!
Emmanuel Jal: All right.
This one goes to Emma McCune Angel to rescue came one afternoon I'm here because you rescued me I'm proud to carry your legacy Thank you. Bless you. R.I.P. What would I be? Me! If Emma never rescued me? What would I be? What would I be? Me! Another starving refugee What would I be? What would I be? Me! If Emma never rescued me? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You would have seen my face on the telly Fat hungry belly Flies in my eyes, head too big for my size Just another little starving child Running around in Africa, born to be wild Praise God, praise the Almighty for sending an angel to rescue me I got a reason for being on this Earth 'Cause I know more than many what a life is worth Now that I got a chance to stand my ground I'm gonna run over mountains, leaps and bounds I ain't an angel, hope I'll be one soon And if I am, I wanna be like Emma McCune Me! What would I be? Me! If Emma never rescued me? What would I be? What would I be? Me! Another starving refugee What would I be? What would I be? Me! If Emma never rescued me? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, Yeah! I would have probably died from starvation Or some other wretched disease I would have grown up with no education Just another refugee I stand here because somebody cared I stand here because somebody dared I know there is a lot of Emmas out there Who is willing and trying to save a life of a child What would I be?

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/david_r_dow_lessons_from_death_row_inmates.html</url>
Two weeks ago, I was sitting at the kitchen table with my wife Katya, and we were talking about what I was gonna talk about today.
We have an 11-year-old son; his name is Lincoln. He was sitting at the same table doing his math homework.
And during a pause in my conversation with Katya, I looked over at Lincoln and I was suddenly thunderstruck by a recollection of a client of mine.
My client was a guy named Will.
He was from North Texas.
He never knew his father very well, because his father left his mom while she was pregnant with him.
And so, he was destined to be raised by a single mom, which might have been all right except that this particular single mom was a paranoid schizophrenic, and when Will was five years old she tried to kill him with a butcher knife.
She was taken away by authorities and placed in a psychiatric hospital, and so for the next several years Will lived with his older brother until he committed suicide by shooting himself through the heart.
And after that Will bounced around from one family member to another, until, by the time he was nine years old, he was essentially living on his own.
That morning that I was sitting with Katya and Lincoln, I looked at my son, and I realized that when my client, Will, was his age, he'd been living by himself for two years.
Will eventually joined a gang and committed a number of very serious crimes, including, most seriously of all, a horrible, tragic murder.
And Will was ultimately executed as punishment for that crime.
But I don't want to talk today about the morality of capital punishment. I certainly think that my client shouldn't have been executed, but what I would like to do today instead is talk about the death penalty in a way I've never done before, in a way that is entirely noncontroversial.
I think that's possible, because there is a corner of the death penalty debate -- maybe the most important corner -- where everybody agrees, where the most ardent death penalty supporters and the most vociferous abolitionists are on exactly the same page.
That's the corner I want to explore.
Before I do that, though, I want to spend a couple of minutes telling you how a death penalty case unfolds, and then I want to tell you two lessons that I have learned over the last 20 years as a death penalty lawyer, from watching well more than a hundred cases unfold in this way.
You can think of a death penalty case as a story that has four chapters.
The first chapter of every case is exactly the same, and it is tragic.
It begins with the murder of an innocent human being, and it's followed by a trial where the murderer is convicted and sent to death row, and that death sentence is ultimately upheld by the state appellate court.
The second chapter consists of a complicated legal proceeding known as a state habeas corpus appeal.
The third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding known as a federal habeas corpus proceeding.
And the fourth chapter is one where a variety of things can happen. The lawyers might file a clemency petition, they might initiate even more complex litigation, or they might not do anything at all.
But that fourth chapter always ends with an execution.
When I started representing death row inmates more than 20 years ago, people on death row did not have a right to a lawyer in either the second or the fourth chapter of this story.
They were on their own.
In fact, it wasn't until the late 1980s that they acquired a right to a lawyer during the third chapter of the story.
So what all of these death row inmates had to do was rely on volunteer lawyers to handle their legal proceedings.
The problem is that there were way more guys on death row than there were lawyers who had both the interest and the expertise to work on these cases.
And so inevitably, lawyers drifted to cases that were already in chapter four -- that makes sense, of course. Those are the cases that are most urgent; those are the guys who are closest to being executed.
Some of these lawyers were successful; they managed to get new trials for their clients.
Others of them managed to extend the lives of their clients, sometimes by years, sometimes by months.
But the one thing that didn't happen was that there was never a serious and sustained decline in the number of annual executions in Texas.
In fact, as you can see from this graph, from the time that the Texas execution apparatus got efficient in the mid- to late-1990s, there've only been a couple of years where the number of annual executions dipped below 20.
In a typical year in Texas, we're averaging about two people a month.
In some years in Texas, we've executed close to 40 people, and this number has never significantly declined over the last 15 years.
And yet, at the same time that we continue to execute about the same number of people every year, the number of people who we're sentencing to death on an annual basis has dropped rather steeply.
So we have this paradox, which is that the number of annual executions has remained high but the number of new death sentences has gone down.
Why is that?
It can't be attributed to a decline in the murder rate, because the murder rate has not declined nearly so steeply as the red line on that graph has gone down.
What has happened instead is that juries have started to sentence more and more people to prison for the rest of their lives without the possibility of parole, rather than sending them to the execution chamber.
Why has that happened?
it hasn't happened because of a dissolution of popular support for the death penalty. Death penalty opponents take great solace in the fact that death penalty support in Texas is at an all-time low.
Do you know what all-time low in Texas means?
It means that it's in the low 60 percent.
Now that's really good compared to the mid 1980s, when it was in excess of 80 percent, but we can't explain the decline in death sentences and the affinity for life without the possibility of parole by an erosion of support for the death penalty, because people still support the death penalty.
What's happened to cause this phenomenon?
that lawyers who represent death row inmates have shifted their focus to earlier and earlier chapters of the death penalty story.
So 25 years ago, they focused on chapter four.
And they went from chapter four 25 years ago to chapter three in the late 1980s.
And they went from chapter three in the late 1980s to chapter two in the mid-1990s. And beginning in the mid- to late-1990s, they began to focus on chapter one of the story.
Now you might think that this decline in death sentences and the increase in the number of life sentences is a good thing or a bad thing.
I don't want to have a conversation about that today.
All that I want to tell you is that the reason that this has happened is because death penalty lawyers have understood that the earlier you intervene in a case, the greater the likelihood that you're going to save your client's life.
That's the first thing I've learned.
Here's the second thing I learned: My client Will was not the exception to the rule; he was the rule.
I sometimes say, if you tell me the name of a death row inmate -- doesn't matter what state he's in, doesn't matter if I've ever met him before -- I'll write his biography for you.
And eight out of 10 times, the details of that biography will be more or less accurate.
And the reason for that is that 80 percent of the people on death row are people who came from the same sort of dysfunctional family that Will did.
Eighty percent of the people on death row are people who had exposure to the juvenile justice system.
That's the second lesson that I've learned.
Now we're right on the cusp of that corner where everybody's going to agree.
People in this room might disagree about whether Will should have been executed, but I think everybody would agree that the best possible version of his story would be a story where no murder ever occurs.
How do we do that?
When our son Lincoln was working on that math problem two weeks ago, it was a big, gnarly problem.
And he was learning how, when you have a big old gnarly problem, sometimes the solution is to slice it into smaller problems.
That's what we do for most problems -- in math and physics, even in social policy -- we slice them into smaller, more manageable problems.
But every once in a while, as Dwight Eisenhower said, the way you solve a problem is to make it bigger.
The way we solve this problem is to make the issue of the death penalty bigger.
We have to say, all right.
We have these four chapters of a death penalty story, but what happens before that story begins?
How can we intervene in the life of a murderer before he's a murderer?
What options do we have to nudge that person that is going to lead to a result that everybody -- death penalty supporters and death penalty opponents -- still think is a bad result: the murder of an innocent human being?
You know, sometimes people say that something isn't rocket science.
And by that, what they mean is rocket science is really complicated and this problem that we're talking about now is really simple.
Well that's rocket science; that's the mathematical expression for the thrust created by a rocket.
What we're talking about today is just as complicated.
What we're talking about today is also rocket science.
My client Will and 80 percent of the people on death row had five chapters in their lives that came before the four chapters of the death penalty story.
I think of these five chapters as points of intervention, places in their lives when our society could've intervened in their lives and nudged them off of the path that they were on that created a consequence that we all -- death penalty supporters or death penalty opponents -- say was a bad result.
Now, during each of these five chapters: when his mother was pregnant with him; in his early childhood years; when he was in elementary school; when he was in middle school and then high school; and when he was in the juvenile justice system -- during each of those five chapters, there were a wide variety of things that society could have done.
In fact, if we just imagine that there are five different modes of intervention, the way that society could intervene in each of those five chapters, and we could mix and match them any way we want, there are 3,000 -- more than 3,000 -- possible strategies that we could embrace in order to nudge kids like Will off of the path that they're on.
So I'm not standing here today with the solution.
But the fact that we still have a lot to learn, that doesn't mean that we don't know a lot already.
We know from experience in other states that there are a wide variety of modes of intervention that we could be using in Texas, and in every other state that isn't using them, in order to prevent a consequence that we all agree is bad.
I'll just mention a few.
I won't talk today about reforming the legal system.
That's probably a topic that is best reserved for a room full of lawyers and judges.
Instead, let me talk about a couple of modes of intervention that we can all help accomplish, because they are modes of intervention that will come about when legislators and policymakers, when taxpayers and citizens, agree that that's what we ought to be doing and that's how we ought to be spending our money.
We could be providing early childhood care for economically disadvantaged and otherwise troubled kids, and we could be doing it for free.
And we could be nudging kids like Will off of the path that we're on.
There are other states that do that, but we don't.
We could be providing special schools, at both the high school level and the middle school level, but even in K-5, that target economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids, and particularly kids who have had exposure to the juvenile justice system.
There are a handful of states that do that; Texas doesn't.
There's one other thing we can be doing -- well, there are a bunch of other things that we could be doing -- there's one other thing that we could be doing that I'm going to mention, and this is gonna be the only controversial thing that I say today.
We could be intervening much more aggressively into dangerously dysfunctional homes, and getting kids out of them before their moms pick up butcher knives and threaten to kill them.
If we're gonna do that, we need a place to put them.
Even if we do all of those things, some kids are going to fall through the cracks and they're going to end up in that last chapter before the murder story begins, they're going to end up in the juvenile justice system.
And even if that happens, it's not yet too late.
There's still time to nudge them, if we think about nudging them rather than just punishing them.
There are two professors in the Northeast -- one at Yale and one at Maryland -- they set up a school that is attached to a juvenile prison.
And the kids are in prison, but they go to school from eight in the morning until four in the afternoon.
Now, it was logistically difficult.
They had to recruit teachers who wanted to teach inside a prison, they had to establish strict separation between the people who work at the school and the prison authorities, and most dauntingly of all, they needed to invent a new curriculum because you know what?
People don't come into and out of prison on a semester basis.
But they did all those things.
Now what do all of these things have in common?
What all of these things have in common is that they cost money.
Some of the people in the room might be old enough to remember the guy on the old oil filter commercial.
He used to say, "Well, you can pay me now or you can pay me later."
What we're doing in the death penalty system is we're paying later.
But the thing is that for every 15,000 dollars that we spend intervening in the lives of economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids in those earlier chapters, we save 80,000 dollars in crime-related costs down the road.
Even if you don't agree that there's a moral imperative that we do it, it just makes economic sense.
I want to tell you about the last conversation that I had with Will.
It was the day that he was going to be executed, and we were just talking.
There was nothing left to do in his case.
And we were talking about his life.
And he was talking first about his dad, who he hardly knew, who had died, and then about his mom, who he did know, who is still alive.
And I said to him, "I know the story.
I've read the records.
I know that she tried to kill you."
I said, "But I've always wondered whether you really actually remember that."
I said, "I don't remember anything from when I was five years old.
Maybe you just remember somebody telling you."
And he looked at me and he leaned forward, and he said, "Professor," -- he'd known me for 12 years, he still called me Professor.
He said, "Professor, I don't mean any disrespect by this, but when your mama picks up a butcher knife that looks bigger than you are, and chases you through the house screaming she's gonna kill you, and you have to lock yourself in the bathroom and lean against the door and holler for help until the police get there," he looked at me and he said, "that's something you don't forget."
I hope there's one thing you all won't forget: In between the time you arrived here this morning and the time we break for lunch, there are going to be four homicides in the United States.
We're going to devote enormous social resources to punishing the people who commit those crimes, and that's appropriate, because we should punish people who do bad things.
But three of those crimes are preventable.
If we make the picture bigger and devote our attention to the earlier chapters, then we're never going to write the first sentence that begins the death penalty story.
Thank you.

On September 10, the morning of my seventh birthday, I came downstairs to the kitchen, where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something, and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway, and they said, "Hey, happy birthday!" And I said, "I'm seven."
And my father smiled and said, "Well, you know what that means, don't you?"
And I said, "Yeah, that I'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents?" And my dad said, "Well, yes.
But, more importantly, being seven means that you've reached the age of reason, and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man."
Now, I had heard this phrase, "age of reason," before.
Sister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about my second-grade class at school. But when she said it, the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession, and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil, and anyway, I hadn't really paid all that much attention to that phrase, "age of reason."
So, I said, "Yeah, yeah, age of reason. What does that mean again?"
And my dad said, "Well, we believe in the Catholic Church that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong, but when you're seven, you're old enough to know better.
So, you've grown up, and reached the age of reason, and now God will start keeping notes on you and begin your permanent record."
And I said, "Oh. Wait a minute. You mean all that time, up till today, all that time I was so good, God didn't notice it?"
And my mom said, "Well, I noticed it."
And I thought, "How could I not have known this before?
How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me?
All that being good and no real credit for it.
And, worst of all, how could I not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me?"
So I said, "Well, Mom and Dad, what about Santa Claus?
I mean, Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice, right?"
And my dad said, "Yeah, but, honey, I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas."
And my mother said, "Oh, Bob, stop it. Let's just tell her.
I mean, she's seven. Julie, there is no Santa Claus."
Now, this was actually not that upsetting to me.
My parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus: how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed that instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve, like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning, our family would give Santa more time.
Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning, but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss.
Which made me very suspicious.
It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents.
I mean, my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style, and my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's.
Plus, why would Santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's?
There's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence: our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit, and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment, this humiliation of rejection by Santa, who was jolly -- but, let's face it, he was also very judgmental.
So, to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief.
I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa, but rather I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing.
It was too late for me, but maybe I could help someone else, someone who could use the information.
They had to fit two criteria: they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason, and not yet seven.
The answer was clear: my brother Bill. He was six.
Well, I finally found Bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground. It was a Saturday, and he was all by himself, just kicking a ball against the side of a wall.
I ran up to him and said, "Bill!
I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven, and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against God and man." And Bill said, "So?" And then I said, "So, you're six. You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it." And he said, "So?" And I said, "So? So everything!" And I turned to run. I was so angry with him.
But when I got to the top of the steps, I turned around dramatically and said, "Oh, by the way, Bill, there is no Santa Claus."
Now, I didn't know it at the time, but I really wasn't turning seven on September 10.
For my 13th birthday, I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends, but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said, "I need to speak to you privately.
September 10 is not your birthday. It's October 10." And I said, "What?"
And she said, "Listen. The cut-off date to start kindergarten was September 15."
"So, I told them that your birthday was on September 10, and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place, so I started to tell you your birthday was September 10.
But, Julie, you were so ready to start school, honey. You were so ready."
I thought about it, and when I was four, I was already the oldest of four children, and my mother even had another child to come, so what I think she understandably really meant was that she was so ready, she was so ready. Then she said, "Don't worry, Julie, every year on October 10 when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it, I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day."
Which was comforting, but troubling.
My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me, without me.
What was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that I was going to have to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends, what was most upsetting was that this meant that I was not a Virgo.
I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom, and I read my horoscope every single day, and it was so totally me.
And this meant that I was a Libra?
So, I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster.
The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair, sort of lounging by some water, but the Libra poster is just a huge scale.
This was around the time that I started filling out physically, and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls, and, frankly, the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing.
But I got the new Libra poster, and I started to read my new Libra horoscope, and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me.
It wasn't until years later, looking back on this whole age-of-reason/change-of-birthday thing, that it dawned on me: I wasn't turning seven when I thought I turned seven. I had a whole other month to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me.
Oh, life can be so cruel.
One day, two Mormon missionaries came to my door.
Now, I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles, and my block is -- well, it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door.
Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven.
And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them.
So, normally I just ignore the doorbell, but on this day I answered.
And there stood two boys, each about 19, in white starched short-sleeved shirts, and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and they said they had a message for me from God.
I said, "A message for me? From God?" And they said, "Yes."
Now, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest, around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know, I've worked with them and even dated them, but I never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission, and I guess I was, sort of, curious, so I said, "Well, please, come in." And they looked really happy, because I don't think this happens to them all that often.
And I sat them down, and I got them glasses of water -- OK, I got it. I got them glasses of water.
Don't touch my hair, that's the thing.
You can't put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair.
OK. So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water, and after niceties they said, "Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart?"
And I thought, "Well, of course I believe in God, but, you know, I don't like that word, heart, because it anthropomorphizes God, and I don't like the word, 'his,' either, because that sexualizes God."
But I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys, so after a very long, uncomfortable pause, I said "Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved."
And they looked at each other and smiled, like that was the right answer. And then they said, "Do you believe that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet?"
And I said, "Yes, I do. Yes, I do." And I was so relieved that it was a question I could answer so quickly.
And they said, "Well, then we have a story to tell you."
And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi, who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC.
Now, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC, everyone was completely bad and evil. Every single one of them: man, woman, child, infant, fetus.
And God came to Lehi and said to him, "Put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here." And God did lead them.
He led them to America.
I said, "America? From Jerusalem to America by boat in 600 BC?"
And they said, "Yes."
Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced, and over the course of 600 years there were two great races of them, the Nephites and the Lamanites, and the Nephites were totally, totally good -- each and every one of them -- and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil -- every single one of them just bad to the bone.
Then, after Jesus died on the cross for our sins, on his way up to heaven he stopped by America and visited the Nephites.
And he told them that if they all remained totally, totally good -- each and every one of them -- they would win the war against the evil Lamanites.
But apparently somebody blew it, because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites.
All but one guy, this guy named Mormon, who managed to survive by hiding in the woods.
And he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates, which he then buried near Palmyra, New York.
Well, I was just on the edge of my seat.
I said, "What happened to the Lamanites?"
And they said, "Well, they became our Native Americans here in the U.S."
And I said, "So, you believe the Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil?" And they said, "Yes."
Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith found those buried gold plates right in his backyard, and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into, and this allowed him to translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English.
Well, at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch.
I wanted to say, "OK, don't start with this story."
I mean, even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start -- -- telling people all about Xenu, the evil intergalactic overlord.
Well, then they said, "Do you believe that God speaks to us through his righteous prophets?" And I said, "No, I don't."
Because I was, sort of, upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story, but the truth was, I hadn't really thought this through, so I backpedaled a little and I said, "Well, what exactly do you mean by righteous?
And what do you mean by prophets? Like, could the prophets be women?"
And they said, "No." And I said, "Why?" And they said, "Well, it's because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular, it is so wonderful, that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy."
What is this wonderful gift God gave women, I wondered?
Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt?
Women's longer lifespan? The fact that women tend to be much less violent than men? But, no, it wasn't any of these gifts.
They said, "Well, it's her ability to bear children."
I said, "Oh, come on. I mean, even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45, assuming they didn't die from exhaustion, it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God." And they said, "No."
Well, then they didn't look so fresh-faced and cute to me any more, but they had more to say.
They said, "Well, we also believe that if you're a Mormon and if you're in good standing with the church, when you die you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity."
And I said, "Oh, dear -- -- that wouldn't be such a good incentive for me."
And they said, "Oh -- hey, well, we also believe that when you go to heaven you get your body restored to you in its best original state.
Like, if you'd lost a leg, well, you get it back.
Or, if you'd gone blind, you could see."
I said, "Oh -- now, I don't have a uterus because I had cancer a few years ago. So, does this mean that if I went to heaven I would get my old uterus back?" And they said, "Sure."
And I said, "I don't want it back. I'm happy without it." Gosh.
What if you had a nose job and you liked it?
Would God force you to get your old nose back?
Well, then they gave me this Book of Mormon, and they told me to read this chapter and that chapter, and they said they'd come back some day and check in on me, and I think I said something like, "Please don't hurry," or maybe it was just, "Please don't," and they were gone.
OK, so, I initially felt really superior to these boys, and smug in my more conventional faith. But then, the more I thought about it, the more I had to be honest with myself.
If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time, and they said, "We believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse, and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us -- -- and she had a baby, and that's the son of God," I mean, I would think that's equally ridiculous.
I'm just so used to that story.
So, I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys.
But the question they asked me when they first arrived really stuck in my head: Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart?
Because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question.
Now, if they'd asked me, Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart?
Well, that would have been much different, I think I would have instantly answered, "Yes, yes, I feel it all the time. I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused, and I feel consoled and cared for. I take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hits, and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see."
But since they asked me that question with the word believe in it, somehow it was all different, because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt.

Martin Luther King did not say, "I have a nightmare," when he inspired the civil rights movements.
He said, "I have a dream."
And I have a dream.
I have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare, and this is going to be a challenge, because, if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times, nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic.
I think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times, "The Road."
It's a beautiful piece of filmmaking, but everything is desolate, everything is dead.
And just a father and son trying to survive, walking along the road.
And I think the environmental movement of which I am a part of has been complicit in creating this vision of the future.
For too long, we have peddled a nightmarish vision of what's going to happen.
We have focused on the worst-case scenario.
We have focused on the problems.
And we have not thought enough about the solutions.
We've used fear, if you like, to grab people's attention.
And any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism.
It's part of the fight and flight mechanism, that when an animal is frightened -- think of a deer.
A deer freezes very, very still, poised to run away.
And I think that's what we're doing when we're asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change.
People are freezing and running away because we're using fear.
And I think the environmental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is.
What would it be like to be improving the human lot?
And one of the problems that we face, I think, is that the only people that have cornered the market in terms of progress is a financial definition of what progress is, an economic definition of what progress is -- that somehow, if we get the right numbers to go up, we're going to be better off, whether that's on the stock market, whether that's with GDP and economic growth, that somehow life is going to get better.
This is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear -- that more is better.
Come on. In the Western world, we have enough.
Maybe some parts of the world don't, but we have enough.
And we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations.
In fact, the architect of our national accounting system, Simon Kuznets, in the 1930s, said that, "A nation's welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income."
But we've created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff.
And indeed, this is probably historical, and it had its time.
In the second World War, we needed to produce a lot of stuff.
And indeed, we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed a lot of Europe, and we had to rebuild it afterwards.
And so our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce.
But as early as 1968, this visionary man, Robert Kennedy, at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign, gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product And he finished his talk with the phrase, that, "The gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile."
How crazy is that? That our measure of progress, our dominant measure of progress in society, is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile?
I believe, if Kennedy was alive today, he would be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile.
He'd be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice, sustainability and people's well-being.
And actually, social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world.
This is from a global survey.
It's asking people, what do they want.
And unsurprisingly, people all around the world say that what they want is happiness, for themselves, for their families, their children, their communities.
Okay, they think money is slightly important.
It's there, but it's not nearly as important as happiness, and it's not nearly as important as love.
We all need to love and be loved in life.
It's not nearly as important as health.
We want to be healthy and live a full life.
These seem to be natural human aspirations.
Why are statisticians not measuring these?
Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms, instead of just how much stuff we have?
And really, this is what I've done with my adult life -- is think about how do we measure happiness, how do we measure well-being, how can we do that within environmental limits.
And we created, at the organization that I work for, the New Economics Foundation, something we call the Happy Planet Index, because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy.
Why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that?
And what we do, is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens.
That should be the goal of every nation on the planet.
But we have to remember that there's a fundamental input to that, and that is how many of the planet's resources we use.
We all have one planet. We all have to share it.
It is the ultimate scarce resource, the one planet that we share.
And economics is very interested in scarcity.
When it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome, it thinks in terms of efficiency.
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck.
And this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our planetary resource use.
It is an efficiency measure.
And probably the easiest way to show you that, is to show you this graph.
Running horizontally along the graph, is "ecological footprint," which is a measure of how much resources we use and how much pressure we put on the planet.
More is bad.
Running vertically upwards, is a measure called "happy life years."
It's about the well-being of nations.
It's like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy.
It's like quality and quantity of life in nations.
And the yellow dot there you see, is the global average.
Now, there's a huge array of nations around that global average.
To the top right of the graph, are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being, but they're using a lot of planet to get there.
They are the U.S.A., other Western countries going across in those triangles and a few Gulf states in there actually.
Conversely, at the bottom left of the graph, are countries that are not producing much well-being -- typically, sub-Saharan Africa.
In Hobbesian terms, life is short and brutish there.
The average life expectancy in many of these countries is only 40 years.
Malaria, HIV/AIDS are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world.
But now for the good news!
There are some countries up there, yellow triangles, that are doing better than global average, that are heading up towards the top left of the graph.
This is an aspirational graph.
We want to be top left, where good lives don't cost the earth.
They're Latin American.
The country on its own up at the top is a place I haven't been to.
Maybe some of you have.
Costa Rica.
Costa Rica -- average life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years.
That is longer than in the USA.
They are, according to the latest Gallup world poll, the happiest nation on the planet -- than anybody; more than Switzerland and Denmark.
They are the happiest place.
They are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in [the] Western world -- a quarter of the resources.
What's going on there?
What's happening in Costa Rica?
We can look at some of the data.
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources.
Their government is one of the first to commit to be carbon neutral by 2021.
They abolished the army in 1949 -- 1949.
And they invested in social programs -- health and education.
They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America and in the world.
And they have that Latin vibe, don't they.
They have the social connectedness.
The challenge is, that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about -- is that the future might not be North American, might not be Western European.
It might be Latin American.
And the challenge, really, is to pull the global average up here.
That's what we need to do.
And if we're going to do that, we need to pull countries from the bottom, and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph.
And then we're starting to create a happy planet.
That's one way of looking at it.
Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends.
We don't have good data going back for every country in the world, but for some of the richest countries, the OECD group, we do.
And this is the trend in well-being over that time, a small increase, but this is the trend in ecological footprint.
And so in strict happy-planet methodology, we've become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to.
And the point really is, is that I think, probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 2050 without an apocalyptic something happening.
It's actually not very long away.
It's half a human lifetime away.
A child entering school today will be my age in 2050.
This is not the very distant future.
This is what the U.K. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like.
And I put it to you, that is not business as usual.
That is changing our business.
That is changing the way we create our organizations, we do our government policy and we live our lives.
And the point is, we need to carry on increasing well-being.
No one can go to the polls and say that quality of life is going to reduce.
None of us, I think, want human progress to stop.
I think we want it to carry on.
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing.
And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in.
I think this is what they want. They want quality of life to keep increasing.
They want to hold on to what they've got.
And if we're going to engage them, I think that's what we've got to do.
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more.
Now that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that, but the point is we need to turn those curves.
And this is where I think we can take a leaf out of systems theory, systems engineers, where they create feedback loops, put the right information at the right point of time.
Human beings are very motivated by the "now."
You put a smart meter in your home, and you see how much electricity you're using right now, how much it's costing you, your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly.
What would that look like for society?
Why is it, on the radio news every evening, I hear the FTSE 100, the Dow Jones, the dollar pound ratio -- I don't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news.
And why do I hear that?
Why don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday, or American used yesterday?
Did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions?
That's how you create a collective goal.
You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it.
And we need positive feedback loops for increasing well-being At a government level, they might create national accounts of well-being.
At a business level, you might look at the well-being of your employees, which we know is really linked to creativity, which is linked to innovation, and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues.
At a personal level, we need these nudges too.
Maybe we don't quite need the data, but we need reminders.
In the U.K., we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do -- never my best thing.
What are these for happiness?
What are the five things that you should do every day to be happier?
We did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago, a big program called the Foresight program -- lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts -- everything evidence based -- a huge tome.
But a piece of work we did was on: what five positive actions can you do to improve well-being in your life?
And the point of these is they are, not quite, the secrets of happiness, but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from.
And the first of these is to connect, is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life.
Do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do, and energy?
Keep building them.
The second one is be active.
The fastest way out of a bad mood: step outside, go for a walk, turn the radio on and dance.
Being active is great for our positive mood.
The third one is take notice.
How aware are you of things going on around the world, the seasons changing, people around you?
Do you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge?
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, [very] strong for our well being.
The fourth is keep learning and keep is important -- learning throughout the whole life course.
Older people who keep learning and are curious, they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down.
But it doesn't have to be formal learning; it's not knowledge based.
It's more curiosity.
It can be learning to cook a new dish, picking up an instrument you forgot as a child.
Keep learning.
And the final one is that most anti-economic of activities, but give.
Our generosity, our altruism, our compassion, are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain.
We feel good if we give.
You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning.
You tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people.
You measure their happiness at the end of the day, those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves.
And these five ways, which we put onto these handy postcards, I would say, don't have to cost the earth.
They don't have any carbon content.
They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied.
And so I think it's really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth.
Now, Martin Luther King, on the eve of his death, gave an incredible speech.
He said, "I know there are challenges ahead, there may be trouble ahead, but I fear no one. I don't care.
I have been to the mountain top, and I have seen the Promised Land."
Now, he was a preacher, but I believe the environmental movement and, in fact, the business community, government, needs to go to the top of the mountain top, and it needs to look out, and it needs to see the Promised Land, or the land of promise, and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want.
And not only that, we need to create a Great Transition to get there, and we need to pave that great transition with good things.
Human beings want to be happy.
Pave them with the five ways.
And we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them -- something like the Happy Planet Index.
And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want, where happiness does not cost the earth.

You know, I'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of TED is compassion, these very moving demonstrations we've just seen: HIV in Africa, President Clinton last night.
And I'd like to do a little collateral thinking, if you will, about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal.
I'm a psychologist, but rest assured, I will not bring it to the scrotal.
There was a very important study done a while ago at Princeton Theological Seminary that speaks to why it is that when all of us have so many opportunities to help, we do sometimes, and we don't other times.
A group of divinity students at the Princeton Theological Seminary were told that they were going to give a practice sermon and they were each given a sermon topic.
Half of those students were given, as a topic, the parable of the Good Samaritan: the man who stopped the stranger in -- to help the stranger in need by the side of the road.
Half were given random Bible topics.
Then one by one, they were told they had to go to another building and give their sermon.
As they went from the first building to the second, each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning, clearly in need. The question is: Did they stop to help?
The more interesting question is: Did it matter they were contemplating the parable of the Good Samaritan? Answer: No, not at all.
What turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry they thought they were in -- were they feeling they were late, or were they absorbed in what they were going to talk about.
And this is, I think, the predicament of our lives: that we don't take every opportunity to help because our focus is in the wrong direction.
There's a new field in brain science, social neuroscience.
This studies the circuitry in two people's brains that activates while they interact.
And the new thinking about compassion from social neuroscience is that our default wiring is to help.
That is to say, if we attend to the other person, we automatically empathize, we automatically feel with them.
There are these newly identified neurons, mirror neurons, that act like a neuro Wi-Fi, activating in our brain exactly the areas activated in theirs. We feel "with" automatically.
And if that person is in need, if that person is suffering, we're automatically prepared to help. At least that's the argument.
But then the question is: Why don't we?
And I think this speaks to a spectrum that goes from complete self-absorption, to noticing, to empathy and to compassion.
And the simple fact is, if we are focused on ourselves, if we're preoccupied, as we so often are throughout the day, we don't really fully notice the other.
And this difference between the self and the other focus can be very subtle.
I was doing my taxes the other day, and I got to the point where I was listing all of the donations I gave, and I had an epiphany, it was -- I came to my check to the Seva Foundation and I noticed that I thought, boy, my friend Larry Brilliant would really be happy that I gave money to Seva.
Then I realized that what I was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit -- that I felt good about myself.
Then I started to think about the people in the Himalayas whose cataracts would be helped, and I realized that I went from this kind of narcissistic self-focus to altruistic joy, to feeling good for the people that were being helped. I think that's a motivator.
But this distinction between focusing on ourselves and focusing on others is one that I encourage us all to pay attention to.
You can see it at a gross level in the world of dating.
I was at a sushi restaurant a while back and I overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman, who was in the singles scene. And this woman says, "My brother is having trouble getting dates, so he's trying speed dating." I don't know if you know speed dating?
Women sit at tables and men go from table to table, and there's a clock and a bell, and at five minutes, bingo, the conversation ends and the woman can decide whether to give her card or her email address to the man for follow up. And this woman says, "My brother's never gotten a card, and I know exactly why.
The moment he sits down, he starts talking non-stop about himself; he never asks about the woman."
And I was doing some research in the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, looking at the back stories of marriages -- because they're very interesting -- and I came to the marriage of Alice Charney Epstein. And she said that when she was in the dating scene, she had a simple test she put people to.
The test was: from the moment they got together, how long it would take the guy to ask her a question with the word "you" in it.
And apparently Epstein aced the test, therefore the article.
Now this is a -- it's a little test I encourage you to try out at a party.
Here at TED there are great opportunities.
The Harvard Business Review recently had an article called "The Human Moment," about how to make real contact with a person at work. And they said, well, the fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your BlackBerry, close your laptop, end your daydream and pay full attention to the person.
There is a newly coined word in the English language for the moment when the person we're with whips out their BlackBerry or answers that cell phone, and all of a sudden we don't exist.
The word is "pizzled": it's a combination of puzzled and pissed off.
I think it's quite apt. It's our empathy, it's our tuning in which separates us from Machiavellians or sociopaths.
I have a brother-in-law who's an expert on horror and terror -- he wrote the Annotated Dracula, the Essential Frankenstein -- he was trained as a Chaucer scholar, but he was born in Transylvania and I think it affected him a little bit.
At any rate, at one point my brother-in-law, Leonard, decided to write a book about a serial killer.
This is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we're in many years ago. He was known as the Santa Cruz strangler.
And before he was arrested, he had murdered his grandparents, his mother and five co-eds at UC Santa Cruz.
So my brother-in-law goes to interview this killer and he realizes when he meets him that this guy is absolutely terrifying.
For one thing, he's almost seven feet tall.
But that's not the most terrifying thing about him.
The scariest thing is that his IQ is 160: a certified genius.
But there is zero correlation between IQ and emotional empathy, feeling with the other person.
They're controlled by different parts of the brain.
So at one point, my brother-in-law gets up the courage to ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to, and that is: how could you have done it?
Didn't you feel any pity for your victims?
These were very intimate murders -- he strangled his victims.
And the strangler says very matter-of-factly, "Oh no. If I'd felt the distress, I could not have done it.
I had to turn that part of me off. I had to turn that part of me off."
And I think that that is very troubling, and in a sense, I've been reflecting on turning that part of us off.
When we focus on ourselves in any activity, we do turn that part of ourselves off if there's another person.
Think about going shopping and think about the possibilities of a compassionate consumerism.
Right now, as Bill McDonough has pointed out, the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences.
We're all unwitting victims of a collective blind spot.
We don't notice and don't notice that we don't notice the toxic molecules emitted by a carpet or by the fabric on the seats.
Or we don't know if that fabric is a technological or manufacturing nutrient; it can be reused or does it just end up at landfill? In other words, we're oblivious to the ecological and public health and social and economic justice consequences of the things we buy and use.
In a sense, the room itself is the elephant in the room, but we don't see it. And we've become victims of a system that points us elsewhere. Consider this.
There's a wonderful book called Stuff: The Hidden Life of Everyday Objects.
And it talks about the back story of something like a t-shirt.
And it talks about where the cotton was grown and the fertilizers that were used and the consequences for soil of that fertilizer. And it mentions, for instance, that cotton is very resistant to textile dye; about 60 percent washes off into wastewater.
And it's well known by epidemiologists that kids who live near textile works tend to have high rates of leukemia.
There's a company, Bennett and Company, that supplies Polo.com, Victoria's Secret -- they, because of their CEO, who's aware of this, in China formed a joint venture with their dye works to make sure that the wastewater would be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater.
Right now, we don't have the option to choose the virtuous t-shirt over the non-virtuous one. So what would it take to do that?
Well, I've been thinking. For one thing, there's a new electronic tagging technology that allows any store to know the entire history of any item on the shelves in that store.
You can track it back to the factory. Once you can track it back to the factory, you can look at the manufacturing processes that were used to make it, and if it's virtuous, you can label it that way. Or if it's not so virtuous, you can go into -- today, go into any store, put your scanner on a palm onto a barcode, which will take you to a website.
They have it for people with allergies to peanuts.
That website could tell you things about that object.
In other words, at point of purchase, we might be able to make a compassionate choice.
There's a saying in the world of information science: ultimately everybody will know everything.
And the question is: will it make a difference?
Some time ago when I was working for The New York Times, it was in the '80s, I did an article on what was then a new problem in New York -- it was homeless people on the streets.
And I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless. And I realized seeing the homeless through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go. They had a diagnosis. It made me -- what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where, when we see, when we're passing someone who's homeless in the periphery of our vision, it stays on the periphery.
We don't notice and therefore we don't act.
One day soon after that -- it was a Friday -- at the end of the day, I went down -- I was going down to the subway. It was rush hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs.
And all of a sudden as I was going down the stairs I noticed that there was a man slumped to the side, shirtless, not moving, and people were just stepping over him -- hundreds and hundreds of people.
And because my urban trance had been somehow weakened, I found myself stopping to find out what was wrong.
The moment I stopped, half a dozen other people immediately ringed the same guy.
And we found out that he was Hispanic, he didn't speak any English, he had no money, he'd been wandering the streets for days, starving, and he'd fainted from hunger.
Immediately someone went to get orange juice, someone brought a hotdog, someone brought a subway cop.
This guy was back on his feet immediately.
But all it took was that simple act of noticing, and so I'm optimistic.
Thank you very much.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/ananda_shankar_jayant_fights_cancer_with_a_dance.html</url>
[Sanskrit] This is an ode to the mother goddess, that most of us in India learn when we are children.
I learned it when I was four at my mother's knee.
That year she introduced me to dance, and thus began my tryst with classical dance.
Since then -- it's been four decades now -- I've trained with the best in the field, performed across the globe, taught young and old alike, created, collaborated, choreographed, and wove a rich tapestry of artistry, achievement and awards.
The crowning glory was in 2007, when I received this country's fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri, for my contribution to art.
But nothing, nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July 2008.
I heard the word "carcinoma."
Yes, breast cancer.
As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office, I heard other words: "cancer," "stage," "grade."
Until then, Cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend, stage was what I performed on, and grades were what I got in school.
That day, I realized I had an unwelcome, uninvited, new life partner.
As a dancer, I know the nine rasas or the navarasas: anger, valor, disgust, humor and fear.
I thought I knew what fear was.
That day, I learned what fear was.
Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control, I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband, Jayant.
I said, "Is this it? Is this the end of the road?
Is this the end of my dance?"
And he, the positive soul that he is, said, "No, this is just a hiatus, a hiatus during the treatment, and you'll get back to doing what you do best."
I realized then that I, who thought I had complete control of my life, had control of only three things: My thought, my mind -- the images that these thoughts created -- and the action that derived from it.
So here I was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you, with the enormity of the situation, wanting to go to a place of healing, health and happiness.
I wanted to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, for which I needed something.
I needed something that would pull me out of all this.
So I dried my tears, and I declared to the world at large ...
I said, "Cancer's only one page in my life, and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life."
I also declared to the world at large that I would ride it out, and I would not allow cancer to ride me.
But to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, I needed something.
I needed an anchor, an image, a peg to peg this process on, so that I could go from there.
And I found that in my dance, my dance, my strength, my energy, my passion, my very life breath.
But it wasn't easy.
Believe me, it definitely wasn't easy.
How do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days?
How do you not despair when, with the body ravaged by chemotherapy, climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture, that to someone like me who could dance for three hours?
How do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all?
All I wanted to do was curl up and weep.
But I kept telling myself fear and tears are options I did not have.
So I would drag myself into my dance studio -- body, mind and spirit -- every day into my dance studio, and learn everything I learned when I was four, all over again, reworked, relearned, regrouped.
It was excruciatingly painful, but I did it.
Difficult.
I focused on my mudras, on the imagery of my dance, on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself.
And slowly, I moved out of that miserable state of mind.
But I needed something else.
I needed something to go that extra mile, and I found it in that metaphor which I had learned from my mother when I was four.
The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini, of Durga.
Durga, the mother goddess, the fearless one, created by the pantheon of Hindu gods.
Durga, resplendent, bedecked, beautiful, her 18 arms ready for warfare, as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur.
Durga, the epitome of creative feminine energy, or shakti.
Durga, the fearless one.
I made that image of Durga and her every attribute, her every nuance, my very own.
Powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training, I brought laser-sharp focus into my dance, laser-sharp focus to such an extent that I danced a few weeks after surgery.
I danced through chemo and radiation cycles, much to the dismay of my oncologist.
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule.
What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance.
Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life.
My story is a story of overcoming setbacks, obstacles and challenges that life throws at you.
My story is the power of thought.
My story is the power of choice.
It's the power of focus.
It's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you, so moves you, that something even like cancer becomes insignificant.
My story is the power of a metaphor.
It's the power of an image.
Mine was that of Durga, Durga the fearless one.
She was also called Simhanandini, the one who rode the lion.
As I ride out, as I ride my own inner strength, my own inner resilience, armed as I am with what medication can provide and continue treatment, as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer, asking my rogue cells to behave, I want to be known not as a cancer survivor, but as a cancer conqueror.
I present to you an excerpt of that work "Simhanandini."

Time flies.
It's actually almost 20 years ago when I wanted to reframe the way we use information, the way we work together: I invented the World Wide Web.
Now, 20 years on, at TED, I want to ask your help in a new reframing.
So going back to 1989, I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system.
Nobody really did anything with it, pretty much.
But 18 months later -- this is how innovation happens -- 18 months later, my boss said I could do it on the side, as a sort of a play project, kick the tires of a new computer we'd got.
And so he gave me the time to code it up.
So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like: hypertext protocol, HTTP; the idea of URLs, these names for things which started with HTTP.
I wrote the code and put it out there.
Why did I do it?
Well, it was basically frustration.
I was frustrated -- I was working as a software engineer in this huge, very exciting lab, lots of people coming from all over the world.
They brought all sorts of different computers with them.
They had all sorts of different data formats, all sorts, all kinds of documentation systems.
So that, in all that diversity, if I wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this, everything I looked into, I had to connect to some new machine, I had to learn to run some new program, I would find the information I wanted in some new data format.
And these were all incompatible.
It was just very frustrating.
The frustration was all this unlocked potential.
In fact, on all these discs there were documents.
So if you just imagined them all being part of some big, virtual documentation system in the sky, say on the Internet, then life would be so much easier.
Well, once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin and even if people don't read your memo -- actually he did, it was found after he died, his copy.
He had written, "Vague, but exciting," in pencil, in the corner.
But in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain what the web was like.
It's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then.
But then -- OK, when TED started, there was no web so things like "click" didn't have the same meaning.
I can show somebody a piece of hypertext, a page which has got links, and we click on the link and bing -- there'll be another hypertext page.
Not impressive.
You know, we've seen that -- we've got things on hypertext on CD-ROMs.
What was difficult was to get them to imagine: so, imagine that that link could have gone to virtually any document you could imagine.
Alright, that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make.
Well, some people did.
So yeah, it was difficult to explain, but there was a grassroots movement.
And that is what has made it most fun.
That has been the most exciting thing, not the technology, not the things people have done with it, but actually the community, the spirit of all these people getting together, sending the emails.
That's what it was like then.
Do you know what? It's funny, but right now it's kind of like that again.
I asked everybody, more or less, to put their documents -- I said, "Could you put your documents on this web thing?"
And you did.
Thanks.
It's been a blast, hasn't it?
I mean, it has been quite interesting because we've found out that the things that happen with the web really sort of blow us away.
They're much more than we'd originally imagined when we put together the little, initial website that we started off with.
Now, I want you to put your data on the web.
Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential.
There is still a huge frustration that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data.
What do you mean, "data"? What's the difference -- documents, data?
Well, documents you read, OK?
More or less, you read them, you can follow links from them, and that's it.
Data -- you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer.
Who was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk?
One of the great -- yes a lot of people have seen it -- one of the great TED Talks.
Hans put up this presentation in which he showed, for various different countries, in various different colors -- he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality, and he shot this thing animated through time.
So, he'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world.
He put up a slide a little bit like this.
It had underground all the data OK, data is brown and boxy and boring, and that's how we think of it, isn't it?
Because data you can't naturally use by itself But in fact, data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it.
In this case, Hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things.
He had put it together, combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he'd put it into this software, which I think his son developed, originally, and produces this wonderful presentation.
And Hans made a point of saying, "Look, it's really important to have a lot of data."
And I was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying, very forcibly, "It's really important to have a lot of data."
So I want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected, or six like he did, but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web and then calling that linked data.
The technology is linked data, and it's extremely simple.
If you want to put something on the web there are three rules: first thing is that those HTTP names -- those things that start with "http:" -- we're using them not just for documents now, we're using them for things that the documents are about.
We're using them for people, we're using them for places, we're using them for your products, we're using them for events.
All kinds of conceptual things, they have names now that start with HTTP.
Second rule, if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data using the HTTP protocol from the web, I will get back some data in a standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know about that thing, about that event.
Who's at the event? Whatever it is about that person, where they were born, things like that.
So the second rule is I get important information back.
Third rule is that when I get back that information it's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born, it's got relationships.
Data is relationships.
Interestingly, data is relationships.
This person was born in Berlin; Berlin is in Germany.
And when it has relationships, whenever it expresses a relationship then the other thing that it's related to is given one of those names that starts HTTP.
So, I can go ahead and look that thing up.
So I look up a person -- I can look up then the city where they were born; then I can look up the region it's in, and the town it's in, and the population of it, and so on.
So I can browse this stuff.
So that's it, really.
That is linked data.
I wrote an article entitled "Linked Data" a couple of years ago and soon after that, things started to happen.
The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots of these boxes that Hans had, and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting.
It's not just a whole lot of other plants.
It's not just a root supplying a plant, but for each of those plants, whatever it is -- a presentation, an analysis, somebody's looking for patterns in the data -- they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together, and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is.
So, linked data.
The meme went out there.
And, pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin who was one of the first people to put interesting things up, he noticed that Wikipedia -- you know Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia with lots and lots of interesting documents in it.
Well, in those documents, there are little squares, little boxes.
And in most information boxes, there's data.
So he wrote a program to take the data, extract it from Wikipedia, and put it into a blob of linked data on the web, which he called dbpedia.
Dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide and if you actually go and look up Berlin, you'll find that there are other blobs of data which also have stuff about Berlin, and they're linked together.
So if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin, you'll end up pulling up these other things as well.
And the exciting thing is it's starting to grow.
This is just the grassroots stuff again, OK?
Let's think about data for a bit.
Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms.
Think of the diversity of the web. It's a really important thing that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there.
So it is with data. I could talk about all kinds of data.
We could talk about government data, enterprise data is really important, there's scientific data, there's personal data, there's weather data, there's data about events, there's data about talks, and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff.
I'm just going to mention a few of them so that you get the idea of the diversity of it, so that you also see how much unlocked potential.
Let's start with government data.
Barack Obama said in a speech, that he -- American government data would be available on the Internet in accessible formats.
And I hope that they will put it up as linked data.
That's important. Why is it important?
Not just for transparency, yeah transparency in government is important, but that data -- this is the data from all the government departments Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America.
It's actual useful. It's got value.
I can use it in my company.
I could use it as a kid to do my homework.
So we're talking about making the place, making the world run better by making this data available.
In fact if you're responsible -- if you know about some data in a government department, often you find that these people, they're very tempted to keep it -- Hans calls it database hugging.
You hug your database, you don't want to let it go until you've made a beautiful website for it.
Well, I'd like to suggest that rather -- yes, make a beautiful website, who am I to say don't make a beautiful website?
Make a beautiful website, but first give us the unadulterated data, we want the data.
We want unadulterated data.
OK, we have to ask for raw data now.
And I'm going to ask you to practice that, OK?
Can you say "raw"?
Audience: Raw.
Tim Berners-Lee: Can you say "data"?
Audience: Data.
TBL: Can you say "now"?
Audience: Now!
TBL: Alright, "raw data now"!
Audience: Raw data now!
Practice that. It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses people come up with to hang onto their data and not give it to you, even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer.
And it's not just America. It's all over the world.
And it's not just governments, of course -- it's enterprises as well.
So I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data.
Here we are at TED, and all the time we are very conscious of the huge challenges that human society has right now -- curing cancer, understanding the brain for Alzheimer's, understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable, understanding how the world works.
The people who are going to solve those -- the scientists -- they have half-formed ideas in their head, they try to communicate those over the web.
But a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment is on databases, often sitting in their computers, and actually, currently not shared.
In fact, I'll just go into one area -- if you're looking at Alzheimer's, for example, drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos, because they had their genomics data in one database in one building, and they had their protein data in another.
Now, they are sticking it onto -- linked data -- and now they can ask the sort of question, that you probably wouldn't ask, I wouldn't ask -- they would.
What proteins are involved in signal transduction and also related to pyramidal neurons?
Well, you take that mouthful and you put it into Google.
Of course, there's no page on the web which has answered that question because nobody has asked that question before.
You get 223,000 hits -- no results you can use.
You ask the linked data -- which they've now put together -- 32 hits, each of which is a protein which has those properties and you can look at.
The power of being able to ask those questions, as a scientist -- questions which actually bridge across different disciplines -- is really a complete sea change.
It's very very important.
Scientists are totally stymied at the moment -- the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems.
Now if I go on like this, you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you.
But, that's not true.
In fact, data is about our lives.
You just -- you log on to your social networking site, your favorite one, you say, "This is my friend."
Bing! Relationship. Data.
You say, "This photograph, it's about -- it depicts this person. " Bing! That's data. Data, data, data.
Every time you do things on the social networking site, the social networking site is taking data and using it -- re-purposing it -- and using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site.
But, when you go to another linked data site -- and let's say this is one about travel, and you say, "I want to send this photo to all the people in that group," you can't get over the walls.
The Economist wrote an article about it, and lots of people have blogged about it -- tremendous frustration.
The way to break down the silos is to get inter-operability between social networking sites.
We need to do that with linked data.
One last type of data I'll talk about, maybe it's the most exciting.
Before I came down here, I looked it up on OpenStreetMap The OpenStreetMap's a map, but it's also a Wiki.
Zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we're in right now -- The Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it.
So I could go into edit mode, I could select the theater, I could add down at the bottom the name, and I could save it back.
And now if you go back to the OpenStreetMap. org, and you find this place, you will find that The Terrace Theater has got a name.
I did that. Me!
I did that to the map. I just did that!
I put that up on there. Hey, you know what?
If I -- that street map is all about everybody doing their bit and it creates an incredible resource because everybody else does theirs.
And that is what linked data is all about.
It's about people doing their bit to produce a little bit, and it all connecting.
That's how linked data works.
You do your bit. Everybody else does theirs.
You may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it.
And we've practiced that.
So, linked data -- it's huge.
I've only told you a very small number of things There are data in every aspect of our lives, every aspect of work and pleasure, and it's not just about the number of places where data comes, it's about connecting it together.
And when you connect data together, you get power in a way that doesn't happen just with the web, with documents.
You get this really huge power out of it.
So, we're at the stage now where we have to do this -- the people who think it's a great idea.
And all the people -- and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because -- even though there's not an immediate return on the investment because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it -- they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things which would be good if everybody else did them.
OK, so it's called linked data.
I want you to make it.
I want you to demand it.
And I think it's an idea worth spreading.
Thanks.

<title>Tim Berners-Lee: The next web</title>
<description>20 years ago, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. For his next project, he's building a web for open, linked data that could do for numbers what the Web did for words, pictures, unlock our data and reframe the way we use it together.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/jamie_drummond_how_to_set_goals_for_the_world.html</url>
So let me start by taking you back, back into the mists of your memory to perhaps the most anticipated year in your life, but certainly the most anticipated year in all human history: the year 2000. Remember that?
Y2K, the dotcom bubble, stressing about whose party you're going to go to as the clock strikes midnight, before the champagne goes flat, and then there's that inchoate yearning that was felt, I think, by many, that the millennium, that the year 2000, should mean more, more than just a two and some zeroes.
Well, amazingly, for once, our world leaders actually lived up to that millennium moment and back in 2000 agreed to some pretty extraordinary stuff: visionary, measurable, long-term targets called the Millennium Development Goals.
Now, I'm sure you all keep a copy of the goals under your pillow, or by the bedside table, but just in case you don't, and your memory needs some jogging, the deal agreed then goes like this: developing countries promised to at least halve extreme poverty, hunger and deaths from disease, alongside some other targets, by 2015, and developed nations promised to help them get that done by dropping debts, increasing smart aid, and trade reform.
Well, we're approaching 2015, so we'd better assess, how are we doing on these goals?
But we've also got to decide, do we like such global goals?
Some people don't. And if we like them, we've got to decide what we want to do on these goals going forward.
What does the world want to do together?
We've got to decide a process by which we decide.
Well, I definitely think these goals are worth building on and seeing through, and here's just a few reasons why.
Incredible partnerships between the private sector, political leaders, philanthropists and amazing grassroots activists across the developing world, but also 250,000 people marched in the streets of Edinburgh outside this very building for Make Poverty History.
All together, they achieved these results: increased the number of people on anti-retrovirals, life-saving anti-AIDS drugs; nearly halved deaths from malaria; vaccinated so many that 5.4 million lives will be saved.
And combined, this is going to result in two million fewer children dying every year, last year, than in the year 2000.
That's 5,000 fewer kids dying every day, ten times you lot not dead every day, because of all of these partnerships.
So I think this is amazing living proof of progress that more people should know about, but the challenge of communicating this kind of good news is probably the subject of a different TEDTalk.
Anyway, for now, anyone involved in getting these results, thank you. I think this proved these goals are worth it.
But there's still a lot of unfinished business.
Still, 7.6 million children die every year of preventable, treatable diseases, and 178 million kids are malnourished to the point of stunting, a horrible term which means physical and cognitive lifelong impairment.
So there's plainly a lot more to do on the goals we've got.
But then, a lot of people think there are things that should have been in the original package that weren't agreed back then that should now be included, like sustainable development targets, natural resource governance targets, access to opportunity, to knowledge, equity, fighting corruption.
All of this is measurable and could be in the new goals.
But the key thing here is, what do you think should be in the new goals?
What do you want?
Are you annoyed that I didn't talk about gender equality or education?
Should those be in the new package of goals?
And quite frankly, that's a good question, but there's going to be some tough tradeoffs and choices here, so you want to hope that the process by which the world decides these new goals is going to be legitimate, right?
Well, as we gather here in Edinburgh, technocrats appointed by the U.N. and certain governments, with the best intentions, are busying themselves designing a new package of goals, and currently they're doing that through pretty much the same old late-20th-century, top-down, elite, closed process.
But, of course, since then, the Web and mobile telephony, along with ubiquitous reality TV formats have spread all around the world.
So what we'd like to propose is that we use them to involve people from all around the world in an historic first: the world's first truly global poll and consultation, where everyone everywhere has an equal voice for the very first time.
I mean, wouldn't it be a huge historic missed opportunity not to do this, given that we can?
There's hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake, tens of millions of lives, or deaths, at stake, and, I'd argue, the security and future of you and your family is also at stake.
So, if you're with me, I'd say there's three essential steps in this crowdsourcing campaign: collecting, connecting and committing.
So first of all, we've got to ground this campaign in core polling data.
Let's go into every country that will let us in, ask 1,001 people what they want the new goals to be, making special efforts to reach the poorest, those without access to modern technology, and let's make sure that their views are at the center of the goals going forward.
Then, we've got to commission a baseline survey to make sure we can monitor and progress the goals going forward. The original goals didn't really have good baseline survey data, and we're going to need the help of big data through all of this process to make sure we can really monitor the progress.
And then we've got to connect with the big crowd.
Now here, we see the role for an unprecedented coalition of social media giants and upstarts, telecoms companies, reality TV show formats, gaming companies, telecoms, all of them together in kind of their "We Are The World" moment.
Could they come together and help the Millennium Development Goals get rebranded into the Millennial Generation's Goals?
And if just five percent of the five billion plus who are currently connected made a comment, and that comment turned into a commitment, we could crowdsource a force of 300 million people around the world to help see these goals through.
If we have this collected data, and this connected crowd, based upon our experience of campaigning and getting world leaders to commit, I think world leaders will commit to most of the crowdsourced recommendations.
But the question really is, through this process will we all have become committed?
And if we are, are we ready to iterate, monitor and provide feedback, make sure these promises are really delivering results?
Well, there's some fantastic examples here to scale up, mostly piloted within Africa, actually.
There's Open Data Kenya, which geocodes and crowdsources information about where projects are, are they delivering results.
Often, they're not in the right place.
And Ushahidi, which means "witness" in Swahili, which geocodes and crowdsources information in complex emergencies to help target responses.
This is some of the most exciting stuff in development and democracy, where citizens on the edge of a network are helping to force open the process to make sure that the big global aid promises and vague stuff up at the top really delivers for people at a grassroots level and inverts that pyramid.
This openness, this forcing openness, is key, and if it wasn't entirely transparent already, I should be open: I've got a completely transparent agenda.
Long-term trends suggest that this century is going to be a tough place to live, with population increases, consumption patterns increasing, and conflict over scarce natural resources.
And look at the state of global politics today.
Look at the Rio Earth Summit that happened just last week, or the Mexican G20, also last week.
Both, if we're honest, a bust.
Our world leaders, our global politics, currently can't get it done.
They need our help. They need the cavalry, and the cavalry's not going to come from Mars.
It's got to come from us, and I see this process of deciding democratically in a bottom-up fashion what the world wants to work on together as one vital means by which we can crowdsource the force to really build that constituency that's going to reinvigorate global governance in the 21st century.
I started in 2000. Let me finish in 2030.
Many people made fun of a big campaign a few years ago we had called Make Poverty History.
It was a naive thought in many people's minds, and it's true, it was just a t-shirt slogan that worked for the moment. But look.
The empirical condition of living under a dollar and 25 is trending down, and look where it gets to by 2030.
It's getting near zero.
Now sure, progress in China and India and poverty reduction there was key to that, but recently also in Africa, poverty rates are being reduced.
It will get harder as we get towards zero, as the poor will be increasingly located in post-conflict, fragile states, or maybe in middle income states where they don't really care about the marginalized.
But I'm confident, with the right kind of political campaigning and creative and technological innovation combined working together more and more as one, I think we can get this and other goals done.
Thank you.
Jamie, here's the puzzle to me.
If there was an incident today where a hundred kids died in some tragedy or where, say, a hundred kids were kidnapped and then rescued by special forces, I mean, it would be all over the news for a week, right?
You just put up, just as one of your numbers there, that 5,000 -- is that the number?
Jamie Drummond: Fewer children every day.
Five thousand fewer children dying every day.
I mean, it dwarfs, dwarfs everything that is actually on our news agenda, and it's invisible.
This must drive you crazy.
JD: It does, and we're having a huge debate in this country about aid levels, for example, and aid alone is not the whole solution. Nobody thinks it is.
But, you know, if people saw the results of this smart aid, I mean, they'd be going crazy for it.
I wish the 250,000 people who really did march outside this very building knew these results.
Right now they don't, and it would be great to find a way to better communicate it, because we have not.
Creatively, we've failed to communicate this success so far.
If those kinds of efforts just could multiply their voice and amplify it at the key moments, I know for a fact we'd get better policy.
The Mexican G20 need not have been a bust.
Rio, if anyone cares about the environment, need not have been a bust, okay?
But these conferences are going on, and I know people get skeptical and cynical about the big global summits and the promises and their never being kept, but actually, the bits that are, are making a difference, and what the politicians need is more permission from the public.
But you haven't fully worked out the Web mechanisms, etc.
by which this might happen.
I mean, if the people here who've had experience using open platforms, you're interested to talk with them this week and try to take this forward.
JD: Absolutely. All right, well I must say, if this conference led in some way to advancing that idea, that's a huge idea, and if you carry that forward, that is really awesome, so thank you. JD: I'd love your help.
Thank you, thank you.

The moment I say "school," so many memories come back to me.
It's like after every exam, when I walk out, the teacher would say, "Hey, come.
How did you do?"
I would say with a great smile, "I will definitely pass."
And I didn't understand why, in one hand they say, "Speak the truth," in the other hand, when you say the truth, they hated you.
So it went on like that, and I didn't know where else to find myself.
So I remember those nights I used to go to sleep with asking help from [the] Unknown because, for some reason, I couldn't believe what my father and mother hanged in the Puja room as a god, because my friend's family had something else as a god.
So I thought, "I guess I'll pray to [the] Unknown and ask help," and started getting help from everywhere, each and every corner of my life at that time.
My brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting.
Then, when I was in eighth standard around 13 years old, I started working in a part-time job in one of the signboard artists called Putu.
And then school also started supporting me.
"Oh, he's bad at studies, but let him send to the drawing competitions."
So it was good to survive with that little tool that I found to find my own place in school.
And one of those competitions, I just won a small, little transistor Philips radio.
And I didn't have the patience to wait until I reached home.
So I just switched on in the train, loudly.
If you travel in Indian trains, you can see people listening to radio and, you know, even from their mobiles.
So at that time -- and I was 13 -- and I was listening to just radio, and someone happened to sit next to me, like these three people are sitting here.
You know, like just adjacent to me.
He just started asking, "Where did you buy the radio? How much is it?"
I said, "It's a prize from [an] art competition."
And he said, "Oh, I teach at a college of arts.
I think you should study in a school of art.
You just quit school and come there."
So, why I'm telling you this, you know, maybe, you know, whoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life -- it's possible.
It is that we need we need to be open and fine-tuned.
So that's what made me enter [the] college of arts after three attempts and just continue to inquire what I really want to do with art work, or art and finally I'm here in front of you.
When I look back, you know, on what happened between that time and now here -- the last 10/15 years -- I can see that most of the works revolve around three subjects, but it was not intentional.
And I just start out with a trace because I was thinking, "What really makes us?" -- you know, it's actually [the] past, what makes a person.
So I was thinking, but when you look at the past, the way to understand the past is only by the traces available, because we cannot go back [to] the past.
It can be ruins, or it can be music, or it can be painting or drawing or writing, whatever it is.
But it is just a kind of trace of that time.
And that fascinated me, to explore that territory.
So I was working on the line, but instead of working about traces, I started capturing traces.
So here are some of the works I would like to show you.
So this is called "Self In Progress."
It's just a trace of being in this body.
So here, what happened then, you know -- what I really enjoyed the most is that this sculpture is nothing but a trace of myself.
It's almost like a 3D photograph.
So there is an element of performance, and there is an element of sculpture, and there is an element of feeling one's self, so close to one's self.
So it's almost like fossils for the future.
And then moved slowly to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces.
So this is what I was talking about, while molding, it's such a great experience, because we have freedom of like walking, or moving my hand or, moving around in the space, but the moment this becomes solid, when you cannot move even an inch, because this is plaster of Paris, so the moment you pour it it's like liquid; but after 20 minutes, it's almost like a hard stone.
So this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint because, knowingly or unknowingly, whatever we do, you know, we leave our traces here.
So I just thought, "I'm going to capture thumbprint, footprint, or whatever traces we leave as humans."
This is the trace of fire, this is the trace of sun.
Because when I was capturing traces, you know, this thought comes to me always: is it, only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace, or is there other ways to capture it?"
So this work is nothing but like -- because of the focal length of the lens, it just shows what is on the other side.
So I just put the paper on the focal length, which was an etching print, then I got the portrait of [the] sun from sunlight.
This is called "Dawn to Dawn."
What I did here, I just put like 10 feet [of] paper then put a coconut rope, and just burnt it.
So it took about 24 hours to get this line.
So wherever the fire is eating the paper, that's what becomes the work -- detail.
Even though we have traces when we try to understand them, the perception and context play a major role to understand it.
So do we really understand what it is, or are we trying to get what we think it is?
Then move towards questioning the perception because, even though there are traces, when you try to understand them, you know you play a major role.
So like let's say even a simple act.
How many of you saw a cow crossing in India while you were coming from Bangalore to Mysore?
Can you just raise the hand?
If you just ask an opinion of how, everyone can interpret it.
Like, let's say, if a schoolteacher says, she'll simply say, "To get to the other side."
Why the cow was crossing the road, you know.
The answer can be so different if Potter said it.
He would say, "For the greater good."
Martin Luther King would say, "I imagine a world where all cows will be free to cross the road, without having their motives called into question."
Imagine Moses comes now, and he sees the same cow walking around the street.
He would definitely say, "God came down from heaven, and he said unto the cow, 'Thou shalt cross the road.' And cow crossed the road, and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow."
Freud would say, "The fact that you're at all concerned reveals your underlying sexual insecurity."
If we ask Einstein, he would say, "Whether the cow crossed the road, or the road moved underneath the cow, depends on your frame of reference."
Or Buddha -- if he saw the same cow, he would say, "Asking this question denies your own nature [as a] cow."
So, what we see is just what we think often, and most of the time, we don't see what it is.
It just all depends on one's perception.
And context, what is really context?
You know, I could just show you this little piece of paper.
Because I always think meaning doesn't really exist.
The meaning of what we create in this world doesn't exist.
It's just created by the mind.
If you look at this piece of paper, this is the breadth and this is called length.
This is how we've been taught in school.
But if you tear it in the middle -- now, I didn't touch this breadth, but still, the meaning of this changes.
So what we conceive as a meaning is always not there; it's on the other side, even when we say dark, light, good, bad, tall, short -- all meaning it doesn't exist in reality.
It's just that being a human, the way we train to perceive the reality creates this meaning.
So this work from this period is mostly like -- you know, this is a work called "Light Makes Dark."
It's just captured through from the lamp.
So the lamp is not just giving a light, it's also giving a darkness.
So this is a work of art, which is just trying to explore that.
This is called "Limit Out."
This shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch -- do we really see?
This is an exact negative.
It's about six inches deep in the wall, but it just appears like it's coming out of the wall.
You know the wall is almost like -- this is the first skin, and this is the second, and there's a third, and each creates a meaning.
And we're just pulling the wall off the gallery.
Again, "Inward Out."
It's a full-figure cast from myself.
It's about eight inches deep.
When I was doing that, I always wondered since I've worked with creators -- and now you know, I've moved to questioning the perception -- whenever I see the bird flying in the sky, it just makes me feel like: is there anything behind, are there any traces up there, which as a human, we don't see them?
Is there any way to capture the thought into visual art?
I couldn't find it.
But a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about six, seven months, in the restroom, when I was changing the air freshener that goes from solid substance to vapor.
It's called Odonil.
This is the work I made out of that material.
The process to get to make the sculpture was interesting, because I wrote to Balsara, who produces that air freshener called Odonil, saying, "Dear Sir, I am an artist. This is my catalogue.
Will you help me to make this sculpture?"
They never wrote back to me.
Then I thought, "I will go to the Small Scale Industries Facilitating Unit and ask help."
So I told them, "I'd like to start an air freshener company."
They said, "Of course.
This is the fee for the project report, and we will give you all the details," and they gave.
Finally, I went back to them and said, "It's not for starting the company, it's just to make my own work.
Please come for the show."
And they did.
And this work is in the Devi Art Foundation in Delhi.
In India, nobody really talks about works of art; they always talk about the appreciation of art.
You buy this for 3,000 rupees, it'll become 30,000 in two months.
This is the craft that was going on, but there are a few collectors who also collect art which can depreciate.
And this was collected by Anapum -- which is like, finally in the end, he will not have anything, because it will evaporate.
So this is after a few weeks, this is after a few months.
It's just all about questioning the preconceptions.
So if someone says, "Oh, I see the portrait," it may not be the portrait after a few months.
And if they say it's solid, it will not be solid, it will evaporate.
And if they say they don't get it, that's also not true, because it's in the air.
It's in the same gallery or in the same museum.
So they inhaled it, but they are not aware of it.
While I was doing that work, my mom and my dad, they were looking at it and they said, "Why do you deal with negative subjects all the time?"
And I was like, "What do you mean?"
"Light makes dark and now evaporating self.
Don't you think it remained something about death," they said.
"Of course not. For me," I'm thinking, "this is tucked in some small solid, but the moment it evaporates, it's merged with the whole."
But she said, "No. Still, I don't like it.
Can you make something from nothing as a sculptor?"
I said, "No, mom. It can't be.
Because we can create a sculpture by gathering dust together, or we can break the sculpture and get the dust, but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe."
So, I did this work for her.
It's called "Emerging Angel."
This is the first day -- it just gives the appearance that one is becoming the other.
So, the same sculpture after a few days.
This is after 15/20 days.
Through that small little slit between the glass box and the wood, the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one.
This gave me a greater faith.
That evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith that maybe there is many more possibilities to capture [the] invisible.
So what you see now is called "Shadow Foreshadow."
And what I'd like to tell you is we don't see shadow, and we don't see light too; we see the source of the light.
We see where it's bouncing, but we don't see [them] as they exist.
You know, that's why the night sky, we see the sky as dark, but it's filled with light all the time.
When it's bounced on the moon, we see it.
The same thing in the darkroom.
The little dust particle will again, reflect the light, and we realize the existence of light.
So we don't see dark, we don't see light, we don't see gravity, we don't see electricity.
So, I just started doing this work to inquire further about how to sculpt the space between this object and there.
Because, as a visual artist, if I'm seeing this and I'm seeing that -- but how to sculpt this, you know?
If we sculpt this, this has two reference points.
The skin of this is also representing this.
And skin at the other end also represents the floor.
I did this as an experiment of casting the shadow.
So this is a corrugated box and its shadow.
Then the second one -- the moment you bring any invisible into the visible world it will have all the characteristics of the visible existence.
So that produced a shadow.
Then I thought, okay, let me sculpt that.
Then, again, that becomes an object.
Again, throwing light, then the third one.
So what you see is nothing but shadow of a shadow of a shadow.
And then again, at that point, there is no shadow.
I thought, "Oh, good. Work is finished."
You can see the detail.
This is called "Gravity."
It's called "Breath." It's just two holes on the gallery wall.
It's a false wall, which contains like 110 cubic feet.
So that hole actually makes the air come out and go in.
So where it's happening, we can see, but what is happening will remain invisible only.
This is from the show called "Invisible," at Talwar Gallery.
This is called "Kaayam."
Detail.
And what I'd like to tell you, our senses are so limited -- we cannot hear everything, we cannot see everything.
We don't feel, "I am touching the air," but if the breeze is a little more faster, then I can feel it.
So all of our construction of reality is through these limited senses.
So my recourse was like, is there any way to use all this as just a symbol or a sign?
And to really get to the point, we should move beyond, you know, go to the other side of the wall, like in logic, like are invisible.
Because when we see someone walks, we see the footprint.
But if we're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it, you will miss the point because the actual journey happens between those footprints, and the footprints are nothing but passing time.
Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/pankaj_ghemawat_actually_the_world_isn_t_flat.html</url>
I'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are, how globalized we aren't, and why it's important to actually be accurate in making those kinds of assessments.
And the leading point of view on this, whether measured by number of books sold, mentions in media, or surveys that I've run with groups ranging from my students to delegates to the World Trade Organization, is this view that national borders really don't matter very much anymore, cross-border integration is close to complete, and we live in one world.
And what's interesting about this view is, again, it's a view that's held by pro-globalizers like Tom Friedman, from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted, but it's also held by anti-globalizers, who see this giant globalization tsunami that's about to wreck all our lives if it hasn't already done so.
The other thing I would add is that this is not a new view.
I'm a little bit of an amateur historian, so I've spent some time going back, trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing. And the best, earliest quote that I could find was one from David Livingstone, writing in the 1850s about how the railroad, the steam ship, and the telegraph were integrating East Africa perfectly with the rest of the world.
Now clearly, David Livingstone was a little bit ahead of his time, but it does seem useful to ask ourselves, "Just how global are we?"
before we think about where we go from here.
So the best way I've found of trying to get people to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat, may not even be close to flat, is with some data.
So one of the things I've been doing over the last few years is really compiling data on things that could either happen within national borders or across national borders, and I've looked at the cross-border component as a percentage of the total.
I'm not going to present all the data that I have here today, but let me just give you a few data points.
I'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow, one kind of flow of people, one kind of flow of capital, and, of course, trade in products and services.
So let's start off with plain old telephone service.
Of all the voice-calling minutes in the world last year, what percentage do you think were accounted for by cross-border phone calls?
Pick a percentage in your own mind.
The answer turns out to be two percent.
If you include Internet telephony, you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent, but it's nowhere near what people tend to estimate.
Or let's turn to people moving across borders.
One particular thing we might look at, in terms of long-term flows of people, is what percentage of the world's population is accounted for by first-generation immigrants?
Again, please pick a percentage.
Turns out to be a little bit higher.
It's actually about three percent.
Or think of investment. Take all the real investment that went on in the world in 2010.
What percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment?
Not quite ten percent.
And then finally, the one statistic that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen: the export-to-GDP ratio.
If you look at the official statistics, they typically indicate a little bit above 30 percent.
However, there's a big problem with the official statistics, in that if, for instance, a Japanese component supplier ships something to China to be put into an iPod, and then the iPod gets shipped to the U.S., that component ends up getting counted multiple times.
So nobody knows how bad this bias with the official statistics actually is, so I thought I would ask the person who's spearheading the effort to generate data on this, Pascal Lamy, the Director of the World Trade Organization, what his best guess would be of exports as a percentage of GDP, without the double- and triple-counting, and it's actually probably a bit under 20 percent, rather than the 30 percent-plus numbers that we're talking about.
So it's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that I talk about in my book, "World 3.0," that we're very, very far from the no-border effect benchmark, which would imply internationalization levels of the order of 85, 90, 95 percent.
So clearly, apocalyptically-minded authors have overstated the case.
But it's not just the apocalyptics, as I think of them, who are prone to this kind of overstatement.
I've also spent some time surveying audiences in different parts of the world on what they actually guess these numbers to be.
Let me share with you the results of a survey that Harvard Business Review was kind enough to run of its readership as to what people's guesses along these dimensions actually were.
So a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide.
First of all, there is a suggestion of some error.
Okay.
Second, these are pretty large errors. For four quantities whose average value is less than 10 percent, you have people guessing three, four times that level.
Even though I'm an economist, I find that a pretty large error.
And third, this is not just confined to the readers of the Harvard Business Review.
I've run several dozen such surveys in different parts of the world, and in all cases except one, where a group actually underestimated the trade-to-GDP ratio, people have this tendency towards overestimation, and so I thought it important to give a name to this, and that's what I refer to as globaloney, the difference between the dark blue bars and the light gray bars.
Especially because, I suspect, some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims, I think it's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to globaloney.
A couple of different reasons come to mind.
First of all, there's a real dearth of data in the debate.
Let me give you an example. When I first published some of these data a few years ago in a magazine called Foreign Policy, one of the people who wrote in, not entirely in agreement, was Tom Friedman. And since my article was titled "Why the World Isn't Flat," that wasn't too surprising.
What was very surprising to me was Tom's critique, which was, "Ghemawat's data are narrow."
And this caused me to scratch my head, because as I went back through his several-hundred-page book, I couldn't find a single figure, chart, table, reference or footnote.
So my point is, I haven't presented a lot of data here to convince you that I'm right, but I would urge you to go away and look for your own data to try and actually assess whether some of these hand-me-down insights that we've been bombarded with actually are correct.
So dearth of data in the debate is one reason.
A second reason has to do with peer pressure.
I remember, I decided to write my "Why the World Isn't Flat" article, because I was being interviewed on TV in Mumbai, and the interviewer's first question to me was, "Professor Ghemawat, why do you still believe that the world is round?" And I started laughing, because I hadn't come across that formulation before.
And as I was laughing, I was thinking, I really need a more coherent response, especially on national TV. I'd better write something about this.
But what I can't quite capture for you was the pity and disbelief with which the interviewer asked her question.
The perspective was, here is this poor professor.
He's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years.
He really has no idea as to what's actually going on in the world.
So try this out with your friends and acquaintances, if you like. You'll find that it's very cool to talk about the world being one, etc.
If you raise questions about that formulation, you really are considered a bit of an antique.
And then the final reason, which I mention, especially to a TED audience, with some trepidation, has to do with what I call "techno-trances."
If you listen to techno music for long periods of time, it does things to your brainwave activity.
Something similar seems to happen with exaggerated conceptions of how technology is going to overpower in the very immediate run all cultural barriers, all political barriers, all geographic barriers, because at this point I know you aren't allowed to ask me questions, but when I get to this point in my lecture with my students, hands go up, and people ask me, "Yeah, but what about Facebook?"
And I got this question often enough that I thought I'd better do some research on Facebook.
Because, in some sense, it's the ideal kind of technology to think about. Theoretically, it makes it as easy to form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door.
What percentage of people's friends on Facebook are actually located in countries other than where people we're analyzing are based?
The answer is probably somewhere between 10 to 15 percent.
Non-negligible, so we don't live in an entirely local or national world, but very, very far from the 95 percent level that you would expect, and the reason's very simple.
We don't, or I hope we don't, form friendships at random on Facebook. The technology is overlaid on a pre-existing matrix of relationships that we have, and those relationships are what the technology doesn't quite displace. Those relationships are why we get far fewer than 95 percent of our friends being located in countries other than where we are.
So does all this matter? Or is globaloney just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to globalization-related issues?
I want to suggest that actually, globaloney can be very harmful to your health.
First of all, recognizing that the glass is only 10 to 20 percent full is critical to seeing that there might be potential for additional gains from additional integration, whereas if we thought we were already there, there would be no particular point to pushing harder.
It's a little bit like, we wouldn't be having a conference on radical openness if we already thought we were totally open to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about at this conference.
So being accurate about how limited globalization levels are is critical to even being able to notice that there might be room for something more, something that would contribute further to global welfare.
Which brings me to my second point.
Avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization.
So I actually spend most of my "World 3.0" book working through a litany of market failures and fears that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate.
I'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today, so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what I have in mind.
Think of France and the current debate about immigration.
When you ask people in France what percentage of the French population is immigrants, the answer is about 24 percent. That's their guess.
Maybe realizing that the number is just eight percent might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue.
Or to take an even more striking example, when the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations did a survey of Americans, asking them to guess what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid, the guess was 30 percent, which is slightly in excess of the actual level — — of U.S. governmental commitments to federal aid.
The reassuring thing about this particular survey was, when it was pointed out to people how far their estimates were from the actual data, some of them — not all of them — seemed to become more willing to consider increases in foreign aid.
So foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up here, because if you think about it, what I've been talking about today is this notion -- very uncontroversial amongst economists -- that most things are very home-biased.
"Foreign aid is the most aid to poor people," is about the most home-biased thing you can find.
If you look at the OECD countries and how much they spend per domestic poor person, and compare it with how much they spend per poor person in poor countries, the ratio — Branko Milanovic at the World Bank did the calculations — turns out to be about 30,000 to one.
Now of course, some of us, if we truly are cosmopolitan, would like to see that ratio being brought down to one-is-to-one.
I'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress from where we are.
If we simply brought that ratio down to 15,000 to one, we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the Rio Summit 20 years ago that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on.
So in summary, while radical openness is great, given how closed we are, even incremental openness could make things dramatically better. Thank you very much.

<description>It may seem that we're living in a borderless world where ideas, goods and people flow freely from nation to nation. We're not even close, says Pankaj Ghemawat. With great data , he argues that there's a delta between perception and reality in a world that's maybe not so hyperconnected after all.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/marisa_fick_jordan_shares_the_wonder_of_zulu_wire_art.html</url>
The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years.
But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire.
Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses.
So, here you can see the change from use -- starting to use contemporary materials.
These pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s.
In the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form, which came from a squatter camp outside Durban.
And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point, and started developing, really, and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design.
And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year.
Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide, so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us, and not only to supply the materials on bobbins, but to produce to our color specifications.
At the same time, I was thinking, well, there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products, away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary.
So I developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range -- that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market.
We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes, forms. The scale became very important, and it's become our pet project. It's successful, it's been running for 12 years. And we supply the Conran shops, and Donna Karan, and so it's kind of great.
This is our group, our main group of weavers.
They come on a weekly basis to Durban.
They all have bank accounts.
They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from.
It's a weekly turnaround of production.
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of.
And that's also modernized today, and it's supporting work for 300 weavers.
And the rest says it all.
Thank you very much.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_cobley_what_physics_taught_me_about_marketing.html</url>
So I work in marketing, which I love, but my first passion was physics, a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher, when I had a little less gray hair.
So he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us.
And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing.
So quick show of hands -- who studied some marketing in university?
Who studied some physics in university?
Pretty good. And at school?
Okay, lots of you.
So, hopefully this will bring back some happy, or possibly some slightly disturbing memories.
So, physics and marketing.
We'll start with something very simple -- Newton's Law: "The force equals mass times acceleration."
This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign.
But if we rearrange this formula quickly, we can get to acceleration equals force over mass, which means that for a larger particle -- a larger mass -- it requires more force to change its direction.
It's the same with brands: the more massive a brand, the more baggage it has, the more force is needed to change its positioning.
And that's one of the reasons why Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture rather than try to persuade the world that Andersen's could stand for something other than accountancy.
It explains why Hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners, and why companies like Unilever and P&amp;G keep brands separate, like Ariel and Pringles and Dove rather than having one giant parent brand.
So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object the more force is needed to change its direction.
The marketing is, the bigger a brand, the more difficult it is to reposition it.
So think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures.
Now, who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?
Getting a little more technical now.
So this says that it's impossible, by definition, to measure exactly the state -- i.e., the position -- and the momentum of a particle, because the act of measuring it, by definition, changes it.
So to explain that -- if you've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it, then the photon of light has momentum, which knocks the particle, so you don't know where it was before you looked at it.
By measuring it, the act of measurement changes it.
The act of observation changes it.
It's the same in marketing.
So with the act of observing consumers, changes their behavior.
Think about the group of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group, and almost none of them buy lots of junk food.
And yet, McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year.
Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets, who stuff their trolleys full of fresh green vegetables and fruit, but don't shop like that any other day.
And if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for porn on the Web, it's very few.
Yet, at Google, we know it's the number-one searched for category.
So luckily, the science -- no, sorry -- the marketing is getting easier.
Luckily, with now better point-of-sale tracking, more digital media consumption, you can measure more what consumers actually do, rather than what they say they do.
So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle, because the observation changes it.
The marketing is -- the message for marketing is -- that try to measure what consumers actually do, rather than what they say they'll do or anticipate they'll do.
So next, the scientific method -- an axiom of physics, of all science -- says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation, you can only disprove it.
What this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning, and it will strengthen it, but it will not conclusively prove it.
And only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water.
So if we take an example -- Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the Earth.
It only took one robust observation from Copernicus to blow that idea out of the water.
And there are parallels for marketing -- you can invest for a long time in a brand, but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers' belief.
Take BP -- they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand, but then one little accident.
Think about Toyota.
It was, for a long time, revered as the most reliable of cars, and then they had the big recall incident.
And Tiger Woods, for a long time, the perfect brand ambassador.
Well, you know the story.
So the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis, but it's easy to disprove it -- any hypothesis is shaky.
And the marketing is that not matter how much you've invested in your brand, one bad week can undermine decades of good work.
So be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups that can undermine your brand.
And lastly, to the slightly obscure world of entropy -- the second law of thermodynamics.
This says that entropy, which is a measure of the disorder of a system, will always increase.
The same is true of marketing.
If we go back 20 years, the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand.
But where we are today, things have changed.
You can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the Conservative Party did earlier this year with their election poster.
But then you lose control of it.
With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer, it's impossible to control where it goes.
Your brand starts being dispersed, it gets more chaotic.
It's out of your control.
I actually saw him speak -- he did a good job.
But while this may be unsettling for marketers, it's actually a good thing.
This distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people, more in with the people.
It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force, which is ultimately good for your brand.
So, the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase; it's a fundamental law.
The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed.
You can't fight it, so embrace it and find a way to work with it.
So to close, my teacher, Mr. Vutter, told me that physics is cool, and hopefully, I've convinced you that physics can teach all of us, even in the world of marketing, something special.
Thank you.

<title>Dan Cobley: What physics taught me about marketing</title>
<description>Physics and marketing don't seem to have much in common, but Dan Cobley is passionate about both. He brings these unlikely bedfellows together using Newton's second law, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the scientific method and the second law of thermodynamics to explain the fundamental theories of branding.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/caroline_phillips_hurdy_gurdy_for_beginners.html</url>
Now, since this is TEDGlobal, who can tell me what this is called in French?
I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy -- "vielle à roue."
And in Spanish, "zanfona."
And in Italian, "ghironda," okay?
Hurdy-gurdy, or wheel fiddle.
So, these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy.
The hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel to rub strings, like the bow of a violin, to produce music.
It has three different kinds of strings.
The first string is the drone string, which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe.
The second string is a melody string, which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano.
And the third string is pretty innovative.
It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique.
It activates what's called the buzzing bridge, or the dog.
When I turn the crank and I apply pressure, it makes a sound like a barking dog.
So all of this is pretty innovative, if you consider that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play it; one to turn the crank, and another person -- yes -- to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs.
Luckily, all of this changed a couple of centuries later.
So, one person could actually play and almost -- this is pretty heavy -- carry the hurdy-gurdy.
The hurdy-gurdy has been used, historically, through the centuries in mostly dance music because of the uniqueness of the melody combined with the acoustic boombox here.
And today, the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music -- traditional folk music, dance, contemporary and world music -- in the U.K., in France, in Spain and in Italy.
And this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [to order and receive it].
It's made by specialized luthiers, also in Europe.
And it's very difficult to tune.
So without further ado, would you like to hear it?
Caroline Phillips: I didn't hear you. Would you like to hear it?
CP: Okay.
There I go.
I'd like to sing in Basque, which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live, in the region in France and Spain.
[Basque] Thank you.
This is a song that I wrote based on traditional Basque rhythms.
And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel.
Thank you. Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/al_vernacchio_sex_needs_a_new_metaphor_here_s_one.html</url>
I'd like to talk to you today about a whole new way to think about sexual activity and sexuality education, by comparison.
If you talk to someone today in America about sexual activity, you'll find pretty soon you're not just talking about sexual activity.
You're also talking about baseball.
Because baseball is the dominant cultural metaphor that Americans use to think about and talk about sexual activity, and we know that because there's all this language in English that seems to be talking about baseball but that's really talking about sexual activity.
So, for example, you can be a pitcher or a catcher, and that corresponds to whether you perform a sexual act or receive a sexual act.
Of course, there are the bases, which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order, ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run, which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm, at least for the guy.
You can strike out, which means you don't get to have any sexual activity.
And if you're a benchwarmer, you might be a virgin or somebody who for whatever reason isn't in the game, maybe because of your age or because of your ability or because of your skillset.
A bat's a penis, and a nappy dugout is a vulva, or a vagina.
A glove or a catcher's mitt is a condom.
A switch-hitter is a bisexual person, and we gay and lesbian folks play for the other team.
And then there's this one: "if there's grass on the field, play ball."
And that usually refers to if a young person, specifically often a young woman, is old enough to have pubic hair, she's old enough to have sex with.
This baseball model is incredibly problematic.
It's sexist. It's heterosexist.
It's competitive. It's goal-directed.
And it can't result in healthy sexuality developing in young people or in adults.
So we need a new model.
I'm here today to offer you that new model.
And it's based on pizza.
Now pizza is something that is universally understood and that most people associate with a positive experience.
So let's do this.
Let's take baseball and pizza and compare it when talking about three aspects of sexual activity: the trigger for sexual activity, what happens during sexual activity, and the expected outcome of sexual activity.
So when do you play baseball?
You play baseball when it's baseball season and when there's a game on the schedule.
It's not exactly your choice.
So if it's prom night or a wedding night or at a party or if our parents aren't home, hey, it's just batter up.
Can you imagine saying to your coach, "Uh, I'm not really feeling it today, I think I'll sit this game out."
That's just not the way it happens.
And when you get together to play baseball, immediately you're with two opposing teams, one playing offense, one playing defense, somebody's trying to move deeper into the field.
That's usually a sign to the boy.
Somebody's trying to defend people moving into the field.
That's often given to the girl.
It's competitive.
We're not playing with each other.
We're playing against each other.
And when you show up to play baseball, nobody needs to talk about what we're going to do or how this baseball game might be good for us.
Everybody knows the rules.
You just take your position and play the game.
But when do you have pizza?
Well, you have pizza when you're hungry for pizza.
It starts with an internal sense, an internal desire, or a need.
"Huh. I could go for some pizza."
And because it's an internal desire, we actually have some sense of control over that.
I could decide that I'm hungry but know that it's not a great time to eat.
And then when we get together with someone for pizza, we're not competing with them, we're looking for an experience that both of us will share that's satisfying for both of us, and when you get together for pizza with somebody, what's the first thing you do?
You talk about it.
You talk about what you want.
You talk about what you like.
You may even negotiate it.
"How do you feel about pepperoni?"
"Not so much, I'm kind of a mushroom guy myself."
"Well, maybe we can go half and half."
And even if you've had pizza with somebody for a very long time, don't you still say things like, "Should we get the usual?"
"Or maybe something a little more adventurous?"
Okay, so when you're playing baseball, so if we talk about during sexual activity, when you're playing baseball, you're just supposed to round the bases in the proper order one at a time.
You can't hit the ball and run to right field.
That doesn't work.
And you also can't get to second base and say, "I like it here. I'm going to stay here."
No.
And also, of course, with baseball, there's, like, the specific equipment and a specific skill set.
Not everybody can play baseball. It's pretty exclusive.
Okay, but what about pizza?
When we're trying to figure out what's good for pizza, isn't it all about what's our pleasure?
There are a million different kinds of pizza.
There's a million different toppings.
There's a million different ways to eat pizza.
And none of them are wrong. They're different.
And in this case, difference is good, because that's going to increase the chance that we're having a satisfying experience.
And lastly, what's the expected outcome of baseball?
Well, in baseball, you play to win.
You score as many runs as you can.
There's always a winner in baseball, and that means there's always a loser in baseball.
But what about pizza?
Well, in pizza, we're not really -- there's no winning. How do you win pizza?
You don't. But you do look for, "Are we satisfied?"
And sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or on different days.
And we get to decide when we feel satisfied.
If we're still hungry, we might have some more.
If you eat too much, though, you just feel gross.
So what if we could take this pizza model and overlay it on top of sexuality education?
A lot of sexuality education that happens today is so influenced by the baseball model, and it sets up education that can't help but produce unhealthy sexuality in young people.
And those young people become older people.
But if we could create sexuality education that was more like pizza, we could create education that invites people to think about their own desires, to make deliberate decisions about what they want, to talk about it with their partners, and to ultimately look for not some external outcome but for what feels satisfying, and we get to decide that.
You may have noticed in the baseball and pizza comparison, under the baseball, it's all commands.
They're all exclamation points.
But under the pizza model, they're questions.
And who gets to answer those questions?
You do. I do.
So remember, when we're thinking about sexuality education and sexual activity, baseball, you're out.
Pizza is the way to think about healthy, satisfying sexual activity, and good, comprehensive sexuality education.
Thank you very much for your time.

<title>Al Vernacchio: Sex needs a new metaphor. Here's one ...</title>
<description>For some reason, says educator Al Vernacchio, the metaphors for talking about sex in the US all come from baseball -- scoring, getting to first base, etc. The problem is, this frames sex as a competition, with a winner and a loser. Instead, he suggests a new metaphor, one that's more about shared pleasure, discussion and agreement, fulfillment and enjoyment. Let's talk about … pizza.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/helen_fisher_tells_us_why_we_love_cheat.html</url>
I'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century, and perhaps in the next 10,000 years.
But I want to start with my work on romantic love, because that's my most recent work.
What I and my colleagues did was put 32 people, who were madly in love, into a functional MRI brain scanner.
17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted; and 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped.
And so I want to tell you about that first, and then go on into where I think love is going.
"What 'tis to love?" Shakespeare said.
I think our ancestors -- I think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago.
I started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was by looking at the last 45 years of research on -- just the psychological research -- and as it turns out, there's a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love.
The first thing that happens is what I call -- a person begins to take on what I call, "special meaning."
As a truck driver once said to me, he said, "The world had a new center, and that center was Mary Anne."
George Bernard Shaw said it a little differently.
He said, "Love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another."
And indeed, that's what we do.
And then you just focus on this person.
You can list what you don't like about them, but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do.
As Chaucer said, "Love is blind."
In trying to understand romantic love, I decided I would read poetry from all over the world, and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth-century China, because it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman.
It's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot -- their car is different from every other car in the parking lot.
Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party.
And in this case, a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat.
And it goes like this. It's by a guy called Yuan Chen: "I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat.
The night I brought you home, I watched you roll it out."
He became hooked on a sleeping mat, probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain, just like with you and me.
But anyway, not only does this person take on special meaning, you focus your attention on them.
You aggrandize them. But you have intense energy.
As one Polynesian said, he said, "I felt like jumping in the sky."
You're up all night. You're walking till dawn.
You feel intense elation when things are going well; mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly.
Real dependence on this person.
As one businessman in New York said to me, he said, "Anything she liked, I liked."
Simple. Romantic love is very simple.
You become extremely sexually possessive.
You know, if you're just sleeping with somebody casually, you don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else.
But the moment you fall in love, you become extremely sexually possessive of them.
I think that that is a Darwinian -- there's a Darwinian purpose to this.
The whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team.
But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving: an intense craving to be with a particular person, not just sexually, but emotionally.
You'd much rather -- it would be nice to go to bed with them, but you want them to call you on the telephone, to invite you out, etc., to tell you that they love you.
The other main characteristic is motivation.
The motor in your brain begins to crank, and you want this person.
And last but not least, it is an obsession.
When I put these people in the machine, before I put them in the MRI machine, I would ask them all kinds of questions.
But my most important question was always the same.
It was: "What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person?"
And indeed, they would say, "All day. All night. I can never stop thinking about him or her."
And then, the very last question I would ask them -- I would always have to work myself up to this question, because I am not a psychologist.
I don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation.
And my final question was always the same.
I would say, "Would you die for him or her?"
And, indeed, these people would say "Yes!"
as if I had asked them to pass the salt.
I was just staggered by it.
So we scanned their brains, looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph, with a distraction task in between.
So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state.
And we found activity in a lot of brain regions.
In fact, one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine.
And indeed, that's exactly what happens.
I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion.
In fact, I had always thought it was a series of emotions, from very high to very low.
But actually, it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind.
The kind of mind -- part of the mind -- when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate, when you want to win that promotion at work.
The motor of the brain. It's a drive.
And in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive.
You know, if you ask somebody to go to bed with you, and they say, "No, thank you," you certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression.
But certainly, around the world, people who are rejected in love will kill for it.
People live for love. They kill for love. They die for love.
They have songs, poems, novels, sculptures, paintings, myths, legends.
In over 175 societies, people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system.
I have come to think it's one of the most powerful brain systems on earth for both great joy and great sorrow.
And I've also come to think that it's one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction.
One is the sex drive: the craving for sexual gratification.
W.H. Auden called it an "intolerable neural itch," and indeed, that's what it is.
It keeps bothering you a little bit, like being hungry.
The second of these three brain systems is romantic love: that elation, obsession of early love.
And the third brain system is attachment: that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long-term partner.
And I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there, looking for a whole range of partners.
You know, you can feel it when you're just driving along in your car.
It can be focused on nobody.
I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time, thereby conserving mating time and energy.
And I think that attachment, the third brain system, evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being -- -- at least long enough to raise a child together as a team.
So with that preamble, I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends.
One of the last 10,000 years and the other, certainly of the last 25 years, that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems: lust, romantic love and deep attachment to a partner.
The first is women working, moving into the workforce.
I've looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations.
And everywhere in the world, 129 out of 130 of them, women are not only moving into the job market -- sometimes very, very slowly, but they are moving into the job market -- and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women in terms of economic power, health and education.
It's very slow.
For every trend on this planet, there's a counter-trend.
We all know of them, but nevertheless -- the Arabs say, "The dogs may bark, but the caravan moves on."
And, indeed, that caravan is moving on.
Women are moving back into the job market.
And I say back into the job market, because this is not new.
For millions of years, on the grasslands of Africa, women commuted to work to gather their vegetables.
They came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal.
The double income family was the standard.
And women were regarded as just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men.
In short, we're really moving forward to the past.
Then, women's worst invention was the plow.
With the beginning of plow agriculture, men's roles became extremely powerful.
Women lost their ancient jobs as collectors, but then with the industrial revolution and the post-industrial revolution they're moving back into the job market.
In short, they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago, 10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago.
We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal.
And it's going to have an impact.
I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community.
I'll only just say a couple of things, and then go on to sex and love.
There's a lot of gender differences; anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child.
I don't know why it is that they want to think that men and women are alike.
There's much we have in common, but there's a whole lot that we do not have in common.
We are -- in the words of Ted Hughes, "I think that we were built to be -- we're like two feet. We need each other to get ahead."
But we did not evolve to have the same brain.
And we're finding more and more and more gender differences in the brain.
I'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love.
One of them is women's verbal ability. Women can talk.
Women's ability to find the right word rapidly, basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen levels peak.
But even at menstruation, they're better than the average man.
Women can talk.
They've been doing it for a million years; words were women's tools.
They held that baby in front of their face, cajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words.
And, indeed, they're becoming a very powerful force.
Even in places like India and Japan, where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market, they're moving into journalism.
And I think that the television is like the global campfire.
We sit around it and it shapes our minds.
Almost always, when I'm on TV, the producers who call me, who negotiate what we're going to say, is a woman.
In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said, "To have a great writer is to have another government."
Today 54 percent of people who are writers in America are women.
It's one of many, many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market.
They've got incredible people skills, negotiating skills.
They're highly imaginative.
We now know the brain circuitry of imagination, of long-term planning.
They tend to be web thinkers.
Because the female parts of the brain are better connected, they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think, put them into more complex patterns, see more options and outcomes.
They tend to be contextual, holistic thinkers, what I call web thinkers.
Men tend to -- and these are averages -- tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous, focus on what they do, and move in a more step-by-step thinking pattern.
They're both perfectly good ways of thinking.
We need both of them to get ahead.
In fact, there's many more male geniuses in the world.
When the -- and there's also many more male idiots in the world.
When the male brain works well, it works extremely well.
And what I really think that we're doing is, we're moving towards a collaborative society, a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued and employed.
But in fact, women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life.
Foremost, women are starting to express their sexuality.
I'm always astonished when people come to me and say, "Why is it that men are so adulterous?"
And I say, "Why do you think more men are adulterous than women?"
"Oh, well -- men are more adulterous!"
And I say, "Who do you think these men are sleeping with?"
And -- basic math!
Anyway.
In the Western world, women start sooner at sex, have more partners, express less remorse for the partners that they do, marry later, have fewer children, leave bad marriages in order to get good ones.
We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression.
And, indeed, once again we're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago, because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today.
We're also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality.
They're now saying that the 21st century is going to be the century of what they call the "symmetrical marriage," or the "pure marriage," or the "companionate marriage."
This is a marriage between equals, moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit.
We're also seeing a rise of romantic love.
91 percent of American women and 86 percent of American men would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner, if they were not in love with that person.
People around the world, in a study of 37 societies, want to be in love with the person that they marry.
Indeed, arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life.
I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend.
The first one being women moving into the job market, the second one being the aging world population.
They're now saying that in America, that middle age should be regarded as up to age 85.
Because in that highest age category of 76 to 85, as much as 40 percent of people have nothing really wrong with them.
So we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age.
And I looked -- for one of my books, I looked at divorce data in 58 societies.
And as it turns out, the older you get, the less likely you are to divorce.
So the divorce rate right now is stable in America, and it's actually beginning to decline.
It may decline some more.
I would even say that with Viagra, estrogen replacement, hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women -- women have never been as interesting as they are now.
Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated, so interesting, so capable.
And so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages, that time is now.
However, there's always kinds of complications in this.
In these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment -- don't always go together.
They can go together, by the way.
That's why casual sex isn't so casual.
With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine.
Dopamine's associated with romantic love, and you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with.
With orgasm, then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin -- those are associated with attachment.
This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you've made love to them.
But these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment, aren't always connected to each other.
You can feel deep attachment to a long-term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else, while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners.
In short, we're capable of loving more than one person at a time.
In fact, you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else.
It's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do.
So I don't think, honestly, we're an animal that was built to be happy; we are an animal that was built to reproduce.
I think the happiness we find, we make.
And I think, however, we can make good relationships with each other.
So I want to conclude with two things.
I want to conclude with a worry -- I have a worry -- and with a wonderful story.
The worry is about antidepressants.
Over 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States.
And these drugs are going generic.
They are seeping around the world.
I know one girl who's been on these antidepressants, serotonin-enhancing -- SSRI, serotonin-enhancing antidepressants -- since she was 13.
She's 23. She's been on them ever since she was 13.
I've got nothing against people who take them short term, when they're going through something perfectly horrible.
They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else.
I would recommend it.
But more and more people in the United States are taking them long term.
And indeed, what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin.
And by raising levels of serotonin, you suppress the dopamine circuit.
Everybody knows that.
Dopamine is associated with romantic love.
Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit, but they kill the sex drive.
And when you kill the sex drive, you kill orgasm.
And when you kill orgasm, you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment.
The things are connected in the brain.
And when you tamper with one brain system, you're going to tamper with another.
I'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place.
So now -- -- thank you.
I want to end with a story. And then, just a comment.
I've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years.
I'm an identical twin; I am interested in why we're all alike.
Why you and I are alike, why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River are all alike.
And about a year ago, an Internet dating service, Match.com, came to me and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them.
I said, "I don't know anything about personality. You know?
I don't know. Do you think you've got the right person?"
They said, "Yes."
It got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another.
That's my current project; it will be my next book.
There's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another.
Timing is important. Proximity is important.
Mystery is important. You fall in love with somebody who's somewhat mysterious, in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain, probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love.
You fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your "love map," an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up.
And I also think that you gravitate to certain people, actually, with somewhat complementary brain systems.
And that's what I'm now contributing to this.
But I want to tell you a story about -- to illustrate.
I've been carrying on here about the biology of love.
I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it, too -- the magic of it.
It's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one of the -- probably a true story.
It was a graduate student at -- I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues -- Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook.
That's where we put our people in the MRI machine.
And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student, and she was not in love with him.
And they were all at a conference in Beijing.
And he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody, you can drive up the dopamine in the brain, and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love.
So he decided he'd put science to work, and he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him.
And sure enough -- I've never been in one, but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it's crazy and it's noisy and it's exciting.
And he figured that this would drive up the dopamine, and she would fall in love with him.
So off they go and she's squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time.
An hour later they get down off of the rickshaw, and she throws her hands up and she says, "Wasn't that wonderful?"
And, "Wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome!"
There's magic to love!
But I will end by saying that millions of years ago, we evolved three basic drives: the sex drive, romantic love and attachment to a long-term partner.
These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain.
They're going to survive as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called "this mortal coil."
Thank you.

<title>Helen Fisher: Why we love, why we cheat</title>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_attia_what_if_we_re_wrong_about_diabetes.html</url>
I'll never forget that day back in the spring of 2006.
I was a surgical resident at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, taking emergency call.
I got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer on her foot.
I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh as I pulled the curtain back to see her.
And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital.
That wasn't being asked.
The question that was being asked of me was a different one, which was, did she also need an amputation?
Now, looking back on that night, I'd love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman on that night with the same empathy and compassion I'd shown the 27-year-old newlywed who came to the E.R. three nights earlier with lower back pain that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer.
In her case, I knew there was nothing I could do that was actually going to save her life.
The cancer was too advanced.
But I was committed to making sure that I could do anything possible to make her stay more comfortable. I brought her a warm blanket and a cup of a coffee.
I brought some for her parents.
But more importantly, see, I passed no judgment on her, because obviously she had done nothing to bring this on herself.
So why was it that, just a few nights later, as I stood in that same E.R. and determined that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation, why did I hold her in such bitter contempt?
You see, unlike the woman the night before, this woman had type 2 diabetes.
She was fat.
And we all know that's from eating too much and not exercising enough, right?
I mean, how hard can it be?
As I looked down at her in the bed, I thought to myself, if you just tried caring even a little bit, you wouldn't be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you've never met about to amputate your foot.
Why did I feel justified in judging her?
I'd like to say I don't know.
But I actually do.
You see, in the hubris of my youth, I thought I had her all figured out.
She ate too much. She got unlucky.
She got diabetes. Case closed.
Ironically, at that time in my life, I was also doing cancer research, immune-based therapies for melanoma, to be specific, and in that world I was actually taught to question everything, to challenge all assumptions and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards.
Yet when it came to a disease like diabetes that kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma, I never once questioned the conventional wisdom.
I actually just assmed the pathologic sequence of events was settled science.
Three years later, I found out how wrong I was.
But this time, I was the patient.
Despite exercising three or four hours every single day, and following the food pyramid to the letter, I'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome.
Some of you may have heard of this.
I had become insulin-resistant.
You can think of insulin as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat, whether we burn it or store it.
This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo.
Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life.
And insulin resistance, as its name suggests, is when your cells get increasingly resistant to the effect of insulin trying to do its job.
Once you're insulin-resistant, you're on your way to getting diabetes, which is what happens when your pancreas can't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin.
Now your blood sugar levels start to rise, and an entire cascade of pathologic events sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease, cancer, even Alzheimer's disease, and amputations, just like that woman a few years earlier.
With that scare, I got busy changing my diet radically, adding and subtracting things most of you would find almost assuredly shocking.
I did this and lost 40 pounds, weirdly while exercising less.
I, as you can see, I guess I'm not overweight anymore.
More importantly, I don't have insulin resistance.
But most important, I was left with these three burning questions that wouldn't go away: How did this happen to me if I was supposedly doing everything right?
If the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me, was it possible it was failing someone else?
And underlying these questions, I became almost maniacally obsessed in trying to understand the real relationship between obesity and insulin resistance.
Now, most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance.
Logically, then, if you want to treat insulin resistance, you get people to lose weight, right?
You treat the obesity.
But what if we have it backwards?
What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all?
In fact, what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem, the tip of a proverbial iceberg?
I know it sounds crazy because we're obviously in the midst of an obesity epidemic, but hear me out.
What if obesity is a coping mechanism for a far more sinister problem going on underneath the cell?
I'm not suggesting that obesity is benign, but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils.
You can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity of ourselves to partition fuel, as I alluded to a moment ago, taking those calories that we take in and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately.
When we become insulin-resistant, the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state.
So now, when insulin says to a cell, I want you to burn more energy than the cell considers safe, the cell, in effect, says, "No thanks, I'd actually rather store this energy."
And because fat cells are actually missing most of the complex cellular machinery found in other cells, it's probably the safest place to store it.
So for many of us, about 75 million Americans, the appropriate response to insulin resistance may actually be to store it as fat, not the reverse, getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat.
This is a really subtle distinction, but the implication could be profound.
Consider the following analogy: Think of the bruise you get on your shin when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table.
Sure, the bruise hurts like hell, and you almost certainly don't like the discolored look, but we all know the bruise per se is not the problem.
In fact, it's the opposite. It's a healthy response to the trauma, all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread of infection to elsewhere in the body.
Now, imagine we thought bruises were the problem, and we evolved a giant medical establishment and a culture around treating bruises: masking creams, painkillers, you name it, all the while ignoring the fact that people are still banging their shins into coffee tables.
How much better would we be if we treated the cause -- telling people to pay attention when they walk through the living room -- rather than the effect?
Getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world.
Getting it wrong, and the pharmaceutical industry can still do very well for its shareholders but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins.
Cause and effect.
So what I'm suggesting is maybe we have the cause and effect wrong on obesity and insulin resistance.
Maybe we should be asking ourselves, is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity, at least in most people?
What if being obese is just a metabolic response to something much more threatening, an underlying epidemic, the one we ought to be worried about?
Let's look at some suggestive facts.
We know that 30 million obese Americans in the United States don't have insulin resistance.
And by the way, they don't appear to be at any greater risk of disease than lean people.
Conversely, we know that six million lean people in the United States are insulin-resistant, and by the way, they appear to be at even greater risk for those metabolic disease I mentioned a moment ago than their obese counterparts.
Now I don't know why, but it might be because, in their case, their cells haven't actually figured out the right thing to do with that excess energy.
So if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance, and you can be lean and have it, this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy for what's going on.
So what if we're fighting the wrong war, fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance?
Even worse, what if blaming the obese means we're blaming the victims?
What if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity are just wrong?
Personally, I can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore, let alone the luxury of certainty.
I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this, but I'm wide open to others.
Now, my hypothesis, because everybody always asks me, is this.
If you ask yourself, what's a cell trying to protect itself from when it becomes insulin resistant, the answer probably isn't too much food.
It's more likely too much glucose: blood sugar.
Now, we know that refined grains and starches elevate your blood sugar in the short run, and there's even reason to believe that sugar may lead to insulin resistance directly.
So if you put these physiological processes to work, I'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake of refined grains, sugars and starches that's driving this epidemic of obesity and diabetes, but through insulin resistance, you see, and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising.
When I lost my 40 pounds a few years ago, I did it simply by restricting those things, which admittedly suggests I have a bias based on my personal experience.
But that doesn't mean my bias is wrong, and most important, all of this can be tested scientifically.
But step one is accepting the possibility that our current beliefs about obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong and therefore must be tested.
I'm betting my career on this.
Today, I devote all of my time to working on this problem, and I'll go wherever the science takes me.
I've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore is pretend I have the answers when I don't.
I've been humbled enough by all I don't know.
For the past year, I've been fortunate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country, and the best part is, just like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals, we've done the same thing.
We've recruited a team of scientific rivals, the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses for what's at the heart of this epidemic.
Some think it's too many calories consumed.
Others think it's too much dietary fat.
Others think it's too many refined grains and starches.
But this team of multi-disciplinary, highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things.
First, this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer.
And two, if we're willing to be wrong, if we're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom with the best experiments science can offer, we can solve this problem.
I know it's tempting to want an answer right now, some form of action or policy, some dietary prescription -- eat this, not that — but if we want to get it right, we're going to have to do much more rigorous science before we can write that prescription.
Briefly, to address this, our research program is focused around three meta-themes, or questions.
First, how do the various foods we consume impact our metabolism, hormones and enzymes, and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms?
Second, based on these insights, can people make the necessary changes in their diets in a way that's safe and practical to implement?
And finally, once we identify what safe and practical changes people can make to their diet, how can we move their behavior in that direction so that it becomes more the default rather than the exception?
Just because you know what to do doesn't mean you're always going to do it.
Sometimes we have to put cues around people to make it easier, and believe it or not, that can be studied scientifically.
I don't know how this journey is going to end, but this much seems clear to me, at least: We can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients like I did.
Most of them actually want to do the right thing, but they have to know what that is, and it's got to work.
I dream of a day when our patients can shed their excess pounds and cure themselves of insulin resistance, because as medical professionals, we've shed our excess mental baggage and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently to go back to our original ideals: open minds, the courage to throw out yesterday's ideas when they don't appear to be working, and the understanding that scientific truth isn't final, but constantly evolving.
Staying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science.
If obesity is nothing more than a proxy for metabolic illness, what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy?
Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R.
seven years ago.
I wish I could speak with that woman again.
I'd like to tell her how sorry I am.
I'd say, as a doctor, I delivered the best clinical care I could, but as a human being, I let you down.
You didn't need my judgment and my contempt.
You needed my empathy and compassion, and above all else, you needed a doctor who was willing to consider maybe you didn't let the system down.
Maybe the system, of which I was a part, was letting you down.
If you're watching this now, I hope you can forgive me.

<title>Peter Attia: Is the obesity crisis hiding a bigger problem?</title>
<description>As a young surgeon, Peter Attia felt contempt for a patient with diabetes. She was overweight, he thought, and thus responsible for the fact that she needed a foot amputation. But years later, Attia received an unpleasant medical surprise that led him to wonder: is our understanding of diabetes right? Could the precursors to diabetes cause obesity, and not the other way around? A look at how assumptions may be leading us to wage the wrong medical war.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_ford_a_future_beyond_traffic_gridlock.html</url>
By birth and by choice, I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life, and for the past 30 years, I've worked at Ford Motor Company.
And for most of those years, I worried about, how am I going to sell more cars and trucks?
But today I worry about, what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks?
What happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles, triples, or even quadruples?
My life is guided by two great passions, and the first is automobiles.
I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company.
I thought it was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincoln and leave it in the driveway.
And I decided about that time, about age 10, that it would be really cool if I was a test driver.
So my parents would go to dinner.
They'd sit down; I'd sneak out of the house.
I'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway, and it was a blast.
And that went on for about two years, until -- I think I was about 12 -- my dad brought home a Lincoln Mark III.
And it was snowing that day.
So he and mom went to dinner, and I snuck out and thought it'd be really cool to do donuts or even some figure-eights in the snow.
My dad finished dinner early that evening.
And he was walking to the front hall and out the front door just about the same time I hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car -- and almost ended up in the front hall.
So it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while.
But I really began to love cars then.
And my first car was a 1975 electric-green Mustang.
And even though the color was pretty hideous, I did love the car, and it really cemented my love affair with cars that's continued on to this day.
But cars are really more than a passion of mine; they're quite literally in my blood.
My great grandfather was Henry Ford, and on my mother's side, my great grandfather was Harvey Firestone.
So when I was born, I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me.
But my great grandfather, Henry Ford, really believed that the mission of the Ford Motor Company was to make people's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them.
Because he believed that with mobility comes freedom and progress.
And that's a belief that I share.
My other great passion is the environment.
And as a young boy, I used to go up to Northern Michigan and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in and then later wrote about.
And it really struck me as the years went by, in a very negative way, when I would go to some stream that I'd loved, and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies, and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it.
And so even at a young age, that really resonated with me, and the whole notion of environmental preservation, at a very basic level, sunk in with me.
As a high-schooler, I started to read authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold and Edward Abbey, and I really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world.
But it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and trucks would ever be in conflict with nature.
And that was true until I got to college.
And when I got to college, you can imagine my surprise when I would go to class and a number of my professors would say that Ford Motor Company and my family was everything that was wrong with our country.
They thought that we were more interested, as an industry, in profits, rather than progress, and that we filled the skies with smog -- and frankly, we were the enemy.
I joined Ford after college, after some soul searching whether or not this is really the right thing to do.
But I decided that I wanted to go and see if I could affect change there.
And as I look back over 30 years ago, it was a little naive to think at that age that I could. But I wanted to.
And I really discovered that my professors weren't completely wrong.
In fact, when I got back to Detroit, my environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced by those in my own company, and certainly by those in the industry.
I had some very interesting conversations, as you can imagine.
There were some within Ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that I needed to stop hanging out with "environmental wackos."
I was considered a radical.
And I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists.
Of course, I had no intention of doing that, and I kept speaking out about the environment, and it really was the topic that we now today call sustainability.
And in time, my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today.
I mean, I think most people in the industry understand that we've got to get on with it.
And the good news is today we are tackling the big issues, of cars and the environment -- not only at Ford, but really as an industry.
We're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights.
And with new technology, we're reducing -- and I believe, someday we'll eliminate -- CO2 emissions.
We're starting to sell electric cars, which is great.
We're developing alternative powertrains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word -- economically, socially and environmentally.
And actually, although we've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do, I can see the day where my two great passions -- cars and the environment -- actually come into harmony.
But unfortunately, as we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem -- and as I said, we're not there yet; we've got a lot of work to do, but I can see where we will -- but even as we're in the process of doing that, another huge problem is looming, and people aren't noticing.
And that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened, just as the environment is.
The problem, put in its simplest terms, is one of mathematics.
Today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world, and within our lifetime, that number's going to grow to about nine billion.
And at that population level, our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth.
And with that growth comes some severe practical problems, one of which is our transportation system simply won't be able to deal with it.
When we look at the population growth in terms of cars, it becomes even clearer.
Today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide.
But with more people and greater prosperity around the world, that number's going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid century.
And this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before.
Now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives.
Today the average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams, and that's a huge waste of time and resources.
But that's nothing compared to what's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest.
Today the average driver in Beijing has a five-hour commute.
And last summer -- many of you probably saw this -- there was a hundred-mile traffic jam that took 11 days to clear in China.
In the decades to come, 75 percent of the world's population will live in cities, and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more.
So you can see the size of the issue that we're facing.
When you factor in population growth, it's clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow.
Frankly, four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars, and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam.
So, if we make no changes today, what does tomorrow look like?
Well I think you probably already have the picture.
Traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge, and they're really very, very inconvenient, but that's all they are.
But the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and health care, particularly to people that live in city centers.
And our quality of life is going to be severely compromised.
So what's going to solve this?
Well the answer isn't going to be more of the same.
My great grandfather once said before he invented the Model T, "If I had asked people then what they wanted, they would have answered, 'We want faster horses.'" So the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads.
When America began moving west, we didn't add more wagon trains, we built railroads.
And to connect our country after World War II, we didn't build more two-lane highways, we built the interstate highway system.
Today we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future.
We are going to build smart cars, but we also need to build smart roads, smart parking, smart public transportation systems and more.
We don't want to waste our time sitting in traffic, sitting at tollbooths or looking for parking spots.
We need an integrated system that uses real time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers.
And frankly, that's the kind of system that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable.
Now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world.
The city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another, and they go underneath the city streets.
And up above, you've got a series of pedestrian walkways.
On New York City's 34th Street, gridlock will soon be replaced with a connected system of vehicle-specific corridors.
Pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created, and all of this will cut down the average rush hour commute to get across town in New York from about an hour today at rush hour to about 20 minutes.
Now if you look at Hong Kong, they have a very interesting system called Octopus there.
It's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system.
So parking garages, buses, trains, they all operate within the same system.
Now shared car services are also springing up around the world, and these efforts, I think, are great.
They're relieving congestion, and they're frankly starting to save some fuel.
These are all really good ideas that will move us forward.
But what really inspires me is what's going to be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other.
Very soon, the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and GPS information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network.
Every morning I drive about 30 miles from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn, Michigan.
And every night I go home, my commute is a total crapshoot.
And I often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home.
But very soon we're going to see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other.
So if the car ahead of me on I-94 hits traffic, it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way.
And these systems are being tested right now, and frankly they're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon.
But the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless.
So just imagine: one day very soon, you're going to be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system.
So you get in your car, and as you get in your car, your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive -- no more driving around looking for one, which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel in today's cars in urban areas -- is looking for parking spots.
Or think about being in New York City and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone so you don't have to wait in the cold to hail one.
Or being at a future TED Conference and having your car talk to the calendars of everybody here and telling you all the best route to take home and when you should leave so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time.
This is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system.
So I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution to this enormous problem.
But as we found out with addressing CO2 issues, and also fossil fuels, there is no one silver bullet.
The solution is not going to be more cars, more roads or a new rail system; it can only be found, I believe, in a global network of interconnected solutions.
Now I know we can develop the technology that's going to make this work, but we've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions -- whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven't even thought of yet; our overall transportation-mix and infrastructure must support all the future options.
We need our best and our brightest to start entertaining this issue.
Companies, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity, as well as an enormous social problem.
And just as these groups embrace the green energy challenge -- and it's really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power, how much money and how much serious thought has, really over the last three years, just poured into the green energy field.
We need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gridlock.
But we need people like all of you in this room, leading thinkers.
I mean, frankly, I need all of you to think about how you can help solve this huge issue.
And we need people from all walks of life; not just inventors, we need policymakers and government officials to also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge.
This isn't going to be solved by any one person or one group.
It's going to really require a national energy policy, frankly for each country, because the solutions in each country are going to be different based upon income levels, traffic jams and also how integrated the systems already are.
But we need to get going, and we need to get going today.
And we must have an infrastructure that's designed to support this flexible future.
You know, we've come a long way.
Since the Model T, most people never traveled more than 25 miles from home in their entire lifetime.
And since then, the automobile has allowed us the freedom to choose where we live, where we work, where we play and frankly when we just go out and want to move around.
We don't want to regress and lose that freedom.
We're on our way to solving -- the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it, and that's the environmental issue, but I believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock.
Because in doing so, we're going to preserve what we've really come to take for granted, which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world.
And it frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this.
Because, if you can envision, as I do, a future of zero emissions and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today, that's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow.
I believe we're at our best when we're confronted with big issues.
This is a big one, and it won't wait.
So let's get started now.
Thank you.

<title>Bill Ford: A future beyond traffic gridlock</title>
<description>Bill Ford is a car guy -- his great-grandfather was Henry Ford, and he grew up inside the massive Ford Motor Co. So when he worries about cars' impact on the environment, and about our growing global gridlock problem, it's worth a listen. His vision for the future of mobility includes "smart roads," even smarter public transport and going green like never before.</description>

Hello. Actually, that's "hello" in Bauer Bodoni for the typographically hysterical amongst us.
One of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the Big wants -- the "Big" being the organization, the system, the country -- and what the "Small" wants -- the individual, the person.
And how do you bring those two things together?
Charlie Ledbetter, yesterday, I thought, talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers, to bring people into the process of creating things.
And that's what I want to talk about today.
So, bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big, I think, is something that we believe in -- something I believe in, and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at Ideo.
I call this first chapter -- for the Brits in the room -- the "Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious."
Often, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face that you kind of miss them. And I think, a lot of times, what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go, "Duh! You know, look what's really going on."
And rather than talk about it in the theory, I think I'm just going to show you an example.
We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota to describe to them what their patient experience was.
And I think they were expecting -- they'd worked with lots of consultants before -- I think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart with thousands of bubbles and systemic this, that and the other, and all kinds of mappy stuff.
Or even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thing with WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever.
The first thing we actually shared with them was this.
I'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve.
This is 59 seconds into the film.
This is a minute 59.
3:19.
I think something happens. I think a head may appear in a second.
5:10.
5:58.
6:20.
We showed them the whole cut, and they were all completely, what is this?
And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day, all you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience.
And just putting yourself in the position of the patient -- this is Christian, who works with us at Ideo.
He just lay in the hospital bed, and, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time.
That's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital.
And they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.
Oh, my goodness. So, looking at the situation from the point of view of the person out -- as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in -- was, for these guys, quite a revelation.
And so, that was a really catalytic thing for them.
So they snapped into action.
They said, OK, it's not about systemic change.
It's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do.
It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference.
So we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact.
The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley, so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor, you could actually have a conversation with them.
You could, kind of, see them in your rear-view mirror, so it created a tiny human interaction.
Very small example of something that they could do.
Interestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action -- said, OK, we embrace this. What can we do?
The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling.
Which I thought was really -- I showed this to my mother recently.
I think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator.
It's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.
Not particularly the world's best design solution for those of us who are real, sort of, hard-core designers, but nonetheless, a fabulous empathic solution for people.
Things that they started doing themselves -- like changing the floor going into the patient's room so that it signified, "This is my room. This is my personal space" -- was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem.
So you went from public space to private space.
And another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses -- which I love -- was they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards, then they put them on one wall of the patient's room, and they put this sticker there.
So that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick in that room, which was lovely.
So, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact.
I thought that was a really, really nice example.
So this is not particularly a new idea, kind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution.
It's a history of invention based around this.
I'm going to read this because I want to get these names right.
Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter -- came down on a Saturday morning, saw her daughter watching the test card, waiting for programs to come on one morning and from that came Sesame Street.
Malcolm McLean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship.
And he invented the shipping container.
George de Mestral -- this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock -- was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs, sort of little prickly things, and from that came Velcro.
And finally, for the Brits, Percy Shaw -- this is a big British invention -- saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road, when he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye.
So there's a whole series of just using your eyes, seeing things for the first time, seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities.
Second one, without sounding overly Zen, and this is a quote from the Buddha: "Finding yourself in the margins, looking to the edges of things, is often a really interesting place to start."
Blinkered vision tends to produce, I think, blinkered solutions.
So, looking wide, using your peripheral vision, is a really interesting place to look for opportunity.
Again, another medical example here.
We were asked by a device producer -- we did the Palm Pilot and the Treo.
We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo -- they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics.
This was a device that a nurse uses when they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital.
They'll ask the nurses to input data.
And they had this vision of the nurse, kind of, clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly, sort of, gadget-lustish.
When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place -- and I'll explain this in a second -- it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing.
When you're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine -- which was the procedure that this device's data was about; it was for pain management -- you're shit scared; you're freaking out.
And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did, was hold the patient's hand to comfort them. Human gesture -- which made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible.
So, the thing that we designed, much less sexy but much more human and practical, was this.
So, it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination, but it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand.
So, again, going back to this -- the idea that a tiny human gesture dictated the design of this product.
And I think that's really, really important.
So, again, this idea of workarounds.
We use this phrase "workarounds" a lot, sort of, looking around us. I was actually looking around the TED and just watching all of these kind of things happen while I've been here.
This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life -- and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential -- is something that we look at a lot.
We wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it, called "Thoughtless Acts?"
It's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do, which have huge intention and huge opportunity.
Why do we all follow the line in the street?
This is a picture in a Japanese subway.
People consciously follow things even though, why, we don't know.
Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence?
Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to.
We don't know why, but we do.
Why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle?
Again, we're sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions.
And we're always saying to our clients: "You should look at this stuff.
This stuff is really important. This stuff is really vital."
This is people designing their own experiences.
You can draw from this.
We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street, that it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there.
It's there for our use, on some level.
So, again, we sort of co-opt our environment to do all these different things.
We co-opt other experiences -- we take one item and transfer it to another.
And this is my favorite one. My mother used to say to me, "Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to."
But, of course, we all do. We all follow each other every day.
So somebody assumes that because somebody else has done something, that's permission for them to do the same thing.
And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time.
I mean, shopping bag equals "parking meter out of order."
And we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now.
We all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we're doing.
Third section is this idea of not knowing, of consciously putting yourself backwards.
I talk about unthinking situations all the time.
Sort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh.
A friend of mine was a designer at IKEA, and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children.
This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.
Hammer it together. Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me, because they're impossible to assemble.
But big selling bookcase. How do we replicate this for children?
The reality is when you actually watch children, children don't think about things like storage in linear terms.
Children assume permission in a very different way.
Children live on things. They live under things.
They live around things, and so their spatial awareness relationship, and their thinking around storage is totally different.
So the first thing you have to do -- this is Graham, the designer -- is, sort of, put yourself in their shoes. And so, here he is sitting under the table.
So, what came out of this?
This is the storage system that he designed.
So what is this? I hear you all ask. No, I don't.
It's this, and I think this is a particularly lovely solution.
So, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation.
It's a completely empathic solution -- apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it.
But a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary, and I think that's one of the things.
And putting yourself in the position of the person, and I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again from this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel?
And then use that information to fuel solutions?
And I think that's what this is very much about.
Last section: green armband. We've all got them.
It's about this really.
I mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win.
Again, that's one of the themes that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference is: Where do we start? How do we start? What do we do to start?
So, again, we were asked to design a water pump for a company called ApproTEC, in Kenya.
They're now called KickStart.
And, again, as designers, we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form.
And that was completely irrelevant.
When you put yourself in the position of these people, things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle, become much more relevant than the form of it. The way it's produced, it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods and indigenous materials.
So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user.
We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world.
So what seems like a very clunky product is, in fact, incredibly useful.
It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster -- you pump up and down on it.
Children can use it. Adults can use it. Everybody uses it.
It's turning these guys -- again, one of the themes -- it's turning them into entrepreneurs.
These guys are using this very successfully.
And for us, it's been great because it's won loads of design awards.
So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company, the needs of the individuals in the company, to feel good about a product we were actually designing, and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for.
There it is, pumping water from 30 feet.
So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning.
We've made a donation on everybody's behalf here to kick start, no pun intended, their next project.
Because, again, I think, sort of, putting our money where our mouth is, here.
We feel that this is an important gesture.
So we've handed out bracelets. Small is the new big.
I hope you'll all wear them.
So that's it. Thank you.

Contagious is a good word.
Even in the times of H1N1, I like the word.
Laughter is contagious. Passion is contagious.
Inspiration is contagious.
We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers.
But for me, what was contagious about all of them was that they were infected by something I call the "I Can" bug.
So, the question is, why only them?
In a country of a billion people and some, why so few?
Is it luck? Is it chance?
Can we all not systematically and consciously get infected?
So, in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story.
I got infected when I was 17, when, as a student of the design college, I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas, challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me.
And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt, and how contagious that feeling was.
I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.
So, when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab, a lab to prototype and refine a design process that could consciously infect the mind with the "I Can" bug.
And I uncovered that if learning is embedded in real-world context, that if you blur the boundaries between school and life, then children go through a journey of "aware," where they can see the change, "enable," be changed, and then "empower," lead the change.
And that directly increased student wellbeing.
Children became more competent, and less helpless.
But this was all common sense.
So, I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at Riverside.
A little background: when my grade five was learning about child rights, they were made to roll incense sticks, agarbattis, for eight hours to experience what it means to be a child laborer.
It transformed them. What you will see is their journey, and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world.
That's them rolling.
And in two hours, after their backs were broke, they were changed.
And once that happened, they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished.
And look at Ragav, that moment when his face changes because he's been able to understand that he has shifted that man's mindset.
And that can't happen in a classroom.
So, when Ragav experienced that he went from "teacher told me," to "I am doing it." And that's the "I Can" mindshift.
And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured.
But we had parents who said, "Okay, making our children good human beings is all very well, but what about math and science and English?
Show us the grades."
And we did. The data was conclusive.
When children are empowered, not only do they do good, they do well, in fact very well, as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over 2,000 schools in India, Riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India in math, English and science.
So, it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside.
So, on August 15th, Independence Day, 2007, the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad.
Now it was not about Riverside school.
It was about all children. So, we were shameless.
We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation, the police, the press, businesses, and basically said, "When are you going to wake up and recognize the potential that resides in every child?
When will you include the child in the city?
Basically, open your hearts and your minds to the child."
So, how did the city respond?
Since 2007 every other month the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children and childhood.
Here was a city telling its child, "You can."
A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad.
[Unclear] So, the busiest streets closed down.
We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us.
It gets taken over by children.
They are skating. They are doing street plays.
They are playing, all free, for all children.
Atul Karwal: aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier.
And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city.
Kiran Bir Sethi: And the city will give free time.
And Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world.
Geet Sethi: When a city gives to the children, in the future the children will give back to the city.
K And because of that, Ahmedabad is known as India's first child-friendly city.
So, you're getting the pattern. First 200 children at Riverside.
Then 30,000 children in Ahmedabad, and growing.
It was time now to infect India.
So, on August 15th, again, Independence Day, 2009, empowered with the same process, we empowered 100,000 children to say, "I can."
How? We designed a simple toolkit, converted it into eight languages, and reached 32,000 schools.
We basically gave children a very simple challenge.
We said, take one idea, anything that bothers you, choose one week, and change a billion lives.
And they did. Stories of change poured in from all over India, from Nagaland in the east, to Jhunjhunu in the west, from Sikkim in the north, to Krishnagiri in the south.
Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems.
Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street to alcoholism, and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages in Rajasthan.
I mean, it was incredible.
Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children and say, "You can," then they will.
Infection in India.
This is in Rajasthan, a rural village.
Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write.
K First time, a rally and a street play in a rural school -- unheard of -- to tell their parents why literacy is important.
Look at what their parents says.
This program is wonderful.
We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write.
I am so happy that my students did this campaign.
In the future, I will never doubt my students' abilities.
See? They have done it.
K An inner city school in Hyderabad.
Girl: 581. This house is 581 ...
We have to start collecting from 555.
K Girls and boys in Hyderabad, going out, pretty difficult, but they did it.
Even though they are so young, they have done such good work.
First they have cleaned the society, then it will be Hyderabad, and soon India.
It was a revelation for me. It doesn't strike me that they had so much inside them.
Girl: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you, for a very good cause, the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids.
Are you ready, ladies and gentlemen? Audience: Yes!
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!
K So, the charter of compassion starts right here.
Street plays, auctions, petitions.
I mean, they were changing lives.
It was incredible.
So, how can we still stay immune?
How can we stay immune to that passion, that energy, that excitement?
I know it's obvious, but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change, Gandhiji.
70 years ago, it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of "We can."
So, today who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in India?
Last I heard, the preamble still said, "We, the people of India," right?
So, if not us, then who?
If not now, then when?
Like I said, contagious is a good word.
Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/norman_foster_s_green_agenda.html</url>
As an architect you design for the present, with an awareness of the past, for a future which is essentially unknown.
The green agenda is probably the most important agenda and issue of the day.
And I'd like to share some experience over the last 40 years -- we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year -- and to explore and to touch on some observations about the nature of sustainability.
How far you can anticipate, what follows from it, what are the threats, what are the possibilities, the challenges, the opportunities?
I think that -- I've said in the past, many, many years ago, before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda, that it wasn't about fashion -- it was about survival.
But what I never said, and what I'm really going to make the point is, that really, green is cool.
I mean, all the projects which have, in some way, been inspired by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle, in a way celebrating the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life.
I rarely actually quote anything, so I'm going to try and find a piece of paper if I can, [in] which somebody, at the end of last year, ventured the thought about what for that individual, as a kind of important observer, analyst, writer -- a guy called Thomas Friedman, who wrote in the Herald Tribune, about 2006.
He said, "I think the most important thing to happen in 2006 was that living and thinking green hit Main Street.
We reached a tipping point this year where living, acting, designing, investing and manufacturing green came to be understood by a critical mass of citizens, entrepreneurs and officials as the most patriotic, capitalistic, geo-political and competitive thing they could do.
Hence my motto: green is the new red, white and blue."
And I asked myself, in a way, looking back, "When did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear?"
And I think it was July 20, 1969, when, for the first time, man could look back at planet Earth.
And, in a way, it was Buckminster Fuller who coined that phrase.
And before the kind of collapse of the communist system, I was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts in Space City and other places in Russia.
And interestingly, as I think back, they were the first true environmentalists.
They were filled with a kind of pioneering passion, fired about the problems of the Aral Sea.
And at that period it was -- in a way, a number of things were happening.
Buckminster Fuller was the kind of green guru -- again, a word that had not been coined.
He was a design scientist, if you like, a poet, but he foresaw all the things that are happening now.
It's another subject. It's another conversation.
You can go back to his writings: it's quite extraordinary.
It was at that time, with an awareness fired by Bucky's prophecies, his concerns as a citizen, as a kind of citizen of the planet, that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time.
And it's a number of projects.
I select this one because it was 1973, and it was a master plan for one of the Canary Islands.
And this probably coincided with the time when you had the planet Earth's sourcebook, and you had the hippie movement.
And there are some of those qualities in this drawing, which seeks to sum up the recommendations.
And all the components are there which are now in common parlance, in our vocabulary, you know, 30-odd years later: wind energy, recycling, biomass, solar cells.
And in parallel at that time, there was a very kind of exclusive design club.
People who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of Dieter Rams, and the objects that he would create for the company called Braun.
This is going back the mid-'50s, '60s.
And despite Bucky's prophecies that everything would be miniaturized and technology would make an incredible style -- access to comfort, to amenities -- it was very, very difficult to imagine that everything that we see in this image, would be very, very stylishly packaged.
And that, and more besides, would be in the palm of your hand.
And I think that that digital revolution now is coming to the point where, as the virtual world, which brings so many people together here, finally connects with the physical world, there is the reality that that has become humanized, so that digital world has all the friendliness, all the immediacy, the orientation of the analog world.
Probably summed up in a way by the stylish or alternative available here, as we generously had gifted at lunchtime, the [unclear], which is a further kind of development -- and again, inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel.
A very, very beautiful object.
So, something which in [the] '50s, '60s was very exclusive has now become, interestingly, quite inclusive.
And the reference to the iPod as iconic, and in a way evocative of performance, delivery -- quite interesting that [in] the beginning of the year 2007, the Financial Times commented that the Detroit companies envy the halo effect that Toyota has gained from the Prius as the hybrid, energy-conscious vehicle, which rivals the iPod as an iconic product.
And I think it's very tempting to, in a way, seduce ourselves -- as architects, or anybody involved with the design process -- that the answer to our problems lies with buildings.
Buildings are important, but they're only a component of a much bigger picture.
In other words, as I might seek to demonstrate, if you could achieve the impossible, the equivalent of perpetual motion, you could design a carbon-free house, for example.
That would be the answer.
Unfortunately, it's not the answer.
It's only the beginning of the problem.
You cannot separate the buildings out from the infrastructure of cites and the mobility of transit.
For example, if, in that Bucky-inspired phrase, we draw back and we look at planet Earth, and we take a kind of typical, industrialized society, then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings, 44 percent, transport, 34 percent, and industry.
But again, that only shows part of the picture.
If you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport, in other words, the transport of people, which is 26 percent, then 70 percent of the energy consumption is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together.
So the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the cities, of which the buildings are a part.
For example, if you take, and you make a comparison between a recent kind of city, what I'll call, simplistically, a North American city -- and Detroit is not a bad example, it is very car dependent.
The city goes out in annular rings, consuming more and more green space, and more and more roads, and more and more energy in the transport of people between the city center -- which again, the city center, as it becomes deprived of the living and just becomes commercial, again becomes dead.
If you compared Detroit with a city of a Northern European example -- and Munich is not a bad example of that, with the greater dependence on walking and cycling -- then a city which is really only twice as dense, is only using one-tenth of the energy.
In other words, you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous.
So basically, if you wanted to generalize, you can demonstrate that as the density increases along the bottom there, that the energy consumed reduces dramatically.
Of course you can't separate this out from issues like social diversity, mass transit, the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance, the quality of civic spaces.
But again, you can see Detroit, in yellow at the top, extraordinary consumption, down below Copenhagen.
And Copenhagen, although it's a dense city, is not dense compared with the really dense cities.
In the year 2000, a rather interesting thing happened.
You had for the first time mega-cities, [of] 5 million or more, which were occurring in the developing world.
And now, out of typically 46 cities, 33 of those mega-cities are in the developing world.
So you have to ask yourself -- the environmental impact of, for example, China or India.
If you take China, and you just take Beijing, you can see on that traffic system, and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles.
In other words, if you put onto the roads, as is currently happening, 1,000 new cars every day -- statistically, it's the biggest booming auto market in the world -- and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing.
And that urbanization is extraordinary, accelerated pace.
So, if we think of the transition in our society of the movement from the land to the cities, which took 200 years, then that same process is happening in 20 years.
In other words, it is accelerating by a factor of 10.
And quite interestingly, over something like a 60-year period, we're seeing the doubling in life expectancy, over that period where the urbanization has trebled.
If I pull back from that global picture, and I look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology -- which, as a tool, is a tool for designers, and I cite our own experience as a company, and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects -- then how do you measure that change of technology?
How does it affect the design of buildings?
And particularly, how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy, create less pollution and are more socially responsible?
That story, in terms of buildings, started in the late '60s, early '70s.
The one example I take is a corporate headquarters for a company called Willis and Faber, in a small market town in the northeast of England, commuting distance with London.
And here, the first thing you can see is that this building, the roof is a very warm kind of overcoat blanket, a kind of insulating garden, which is also about the celebration of public space.
In other words, for this community, they have this garden in the sky.
So the humanistic ideal is very, very strong in all this work, encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here, where you can see greenery, you can see sunlight, you have a connection with nature.
And nature is part of the generator, the driver for this building.
And symbolically, the colors of the interior are green and yellow.
It has facilities like swimming pools, it has flextime, it has a social heart, a space, you have contact with nature.
Now this was 1973.
In 2001, this building received an award.
And the award was about a celebration for a building which had been in use over a long period of time.
And the people who'd created it came back: the project managers, the company chairmen then.
And they were saying, you know, "The architects, Norman was always going on about designing for the future, and you know, it didn't seem to cost us any more.
So we humored him, we kept him happy."
The image at the top, what it doesn't -- if you look at it in detail, really what it is saying is you can wire this building.
This building was wired for change.
So, in 1975, the image there is of typewriters.
And when the photograph was taken, it's word processors.
And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology.
We were fortunate, because in a way our building was future-proofed.
It anticipated change, even though those changes were not known.
Round about that design period leading up to this building, I did a sketch, which we pulled out of the archive recently.
And I was saying, and I wrote, "But we don't have the time, and we really don't have the immediate expertise at a technical level."
In other words, we didn't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building.
And that would be to create a kind of three-dimensional bubble -- a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate, would breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads.
Notwithstanding the fact that the building, as a green building, is very much a pioneering building.
And if I fast-forward in time, what is interesting is that the technology is now available and celebratory.
The library of the Free University, which opened last year, is an example of that.
And again, the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality.
And a combination of devices here, the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks, and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin, which enables the building to be ventilated, to consume dramatically less energy, and where it's really working with the forces of nature.
And what is interesting is that this is hugely popular by the people who use it.
Again, coming back to that thing about the lifestyle, and in a way, the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit.
So it's not a kind of sacrifice, quite the reverse.
I think it's a great -- it's a celebration.
And you can measure the performance, in terms of energy consumption, of that building against a typical library.
If I show another aspect of that technology then, in a completely different context -- this apartment building in the Alps in Switzerland.
Prefabricated from the most traditional of materials, but that material -- because of the technology, the computing ability, the ability to prefabricate, make high-performance components out of timber -- very much at the cutting edge.
And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology, the ability to plot points in the sky and to transmit, to transfer that information now, directly into the factory.
So if you cross the border -- just across the border -- a small factory in Germany, and here you can see the guy with his computer screen, and those points in space are communicated.
And on the left are the cutting machines, which then, in the factory, enable those individual pieces to be fabricated and plus or minus very, very few millimeters, to be slotted together on site.
And then interestingly, that building to then be clad in the oldest technology, which is the kind of hand-cut shingles.
One quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish.
And again, the way in which that works as a building, for those of us who can enjoy the spaces, to live and visit there.
If I made the leap into these new technologies, then how did we -- what happened before that?
I mean, you know, what was life like before the mobile phone, the things that you take for granted?
Well, obviously the building still happened.
I mean, this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of 1979, which opened in 1985, with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of this space here.
And in the absence of computers, you have to physically model.
So for example, we would put models under an artificial sky.
For wind tunnels, we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air, and the many kilometers of cable and so on.
And the turning point was probably, in our terms, when we had the first computer.
And that was at the time that we sought to redesign, reinvent the airport.
This is Terminal Four at Heathrow, typical of any terminal -- big, heavy roof, blocking out the sunlight, lots of machinery, big pipes, whirring machinery.
And Stansted, the green alternative, which uses natural light, is a friendly place: you know where you are, you can relate to the outside.
And for a large part of its cycle, not needing electric light -- electric light, which in turn creates more heat, which creates more cooling loads and so on.
And at that particular point in time, this was one of the few solitary computers.
And that's a little image of the tree of Stansted.
Not going back very far in time, 1990, that's our office.
And if you looked very closely, you'd see that people were drawing with pencils, and they were pushing, you know, big rulers and triangles.
It's not that long ago, 17 years, and here we are now.
I mean, major transformation.
Going back in time, there was a lady called Valerie Larkin, and in 1987, she had all our information on one disk.
Now, every week, we have the equivalent of 84 million disks, which record our archival information on past, current and future projects.
That reaches 21 kilometers into the sky.
This is the view you would get, if you looked down on that.
But meanwhile, as you know, wonderful protagonists like Al Gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature, set in the context of that, interestingly, those buildings which are celebratory and very, very relevant to this place.
Our Reichstag project, which has a very familiar agenda, I'm sure, as a public place where we sought to, in a way, through a process of advocacy, reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians, public space. And maybe its hidden agenda, an energy manifesto -- something that would be free, completely free of fuel as we know it.
So it would be totally renewable.
And again, the humanistic sketch, the translation into the public space, but this very, very much a part of the ecology.
But here, not having to model it for real.
Obviously the wind tunnel had a place, but the ability now with the computer to explore, to plan, to see how that would work in terms of the forces of nature: natural ventilation, to be able to model the chamber below, and to look at biomass.
A combination of biomass, aquifers, burning vegetable oil -- a process that, quite interestingly, was developed in Eastern Germany, at the time of its dependence on the Soviet Bloc.
So really, retranslating that technology and developing something which was so clean, it was virtually pollution-free.
You can measure it again.
You can compare how that building, in terms of its emission in tons of carbon dioxide per year -- at the time that we took that project, over 7,000 tons -- what it would have been with natural gas and finally, with the vegetable oil, 450 tons.
I mean, a 94 percent reduction -- virtually clean.
We can see the same processes at work in terms of the Commerce Bank -- its dependence on natural ventilation, the way that you can model those gardens, the way they spiral around.
But again, very much about the lifestyle, the quality -- something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work.
And again, we can measure the reduction in terms of energy consumption.
There is an evolution here between the projects, and Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further -- the project in the city in London.
And this sequence shows the buildup of that model.
But what it shows first, which I think is quite interesting, is that here you see the circle, you see the public space around it.
What are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site?
If, for example, you seek to do a building which goes right to the edge of the pavement, it's the same amount of space.
And finally, you profile this, you cut grooves into it.
The grooves become the kind of green lungs which give views, which give light, ventilation, make the building fresher.
And you enclose that with something that also is central to its appearance, which is a mesh of triangulated structures -- again, in a long connection evocative of some of those works of Buckminster Fuller, and the way in which triangulation can increase performance and also give that building its sense of identity.
And here, if we look at a detail of the way that the building opens up and breathes into those atria, the way in which now, with a computer, we can model the forces, we can see the high pressure, the low pressure, the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing.
So it also has the ability, all the time, regardless of the direction of the wind, to be able to make the building fresh and efficient.
And unlike conventional buildings, the top of the building is celebratory.
It's a viewing place for people, not machinery.
And the base of the building is again about public space.
Comparing it with a typical building, what happens if we seek to use such design strategies in terms of really large-scale thinking?
And I'm just going to give two images out of a kind of company research project.
It's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying.
The level is dropping, rather like the Aral Sea.
And the Dead Sea is obviously much lower than the oceans and seas around it.
So there has been a project which rescues the Dead Sea by creating a pipeline, a pipe, sometimes above the surface, sometimes buried, that will redress that, and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba into the Dead Sea.
And our translation of that, using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years, is to say, what if that, instead of being just a pipe, what if it is a lifeline?
What if it is the equivalent, depending on where you are, of the Grand Canal, in terms of tourists, habitation, desalination, agriculture?
In other words, water is the lifeblood.
And if you just go back to the previous image, and you look at this area of volatility and hostility, that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together in a united cause, in terms of something that would be genuinely green and productive in the widest sense.
Infrastructure at that large scale is also inseparable from communication.
And whether that communication is the virtual world or it is the physical world, then it's absolutely central to society.
And how do we make more legible in this growing world, especially in some of the places that I'm talking about -- China, for example, which in the next ten years will create 400 new airports.
Now what form do they take?
How do you make them more friendly at that scale?
Hong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age, because you always have a point of reference.
So what happens when we take that and you expand that further into the Chinese society?
And what is interesting is that that produces in a way perhaps the ultimate mega-building.
It is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment.
250 -- excuse me, 50,000 people working 24 hours, seven days.
Larger by 17 percent than every terminal put together at Heathrow -- built -- plus the new, un-built Terminal Five.
And the challenge here is a building that will be green, that is compact despite its size and is about the human experience of travel, is about friendly, is coming back to that starting point, is very, very much about the lifestyle.
And perhaps these, in the end, as celebratory spaces.
As Hubert was talking over lunch, as we sort of engaged in conversation, talked about this, talked about cities.
Hubert was saying, absolutely correctly, "These are the new cathedrals."
And in a way, one aspect of this conversation was triggered on New Year's Eve, when I was talking about the Olympic agenda in China in terms of its green ambitions and aspirations.
And I was voicing the thought that -- it just crossed my mind that New Year's Eve, a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007 -- that maybe, you know, the future was the most powerful, innovative sort of nation.
The way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say, "We put a man on the moon."
You know, who is going to say that we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels, with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes, and so on.
And that's a concerted platform.
It's more than one device, you know, it's renewable.
And I voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year, I thought that the inspiration was more likely to come from those other, larger countries out there -- the Chinas, the Indias, the Asian-Pacific tigers.
Thank you very much.

<title>Norman Foster: My green agenda for architecture</title>
<description>Architect Norman Foster discusses his own work to show how computers can help architects design buildings that are green, beautiful and "basically pollution-free." From the 2007 DLD Conference, Munich; www.dld-conference.com</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/rogier_van_der_heide_why_light_needs_darkness.html</url>
There's a beautiful statement on the screen that says, "Light creates ambiance, and light is also the expression of structure."
Well that was not by me.
That was, of course, by Le Corbusier, the famous architect.
And here you can see what he meant in one of his beautiful buildings -- the chapel Notre Dame du Haut, Ronchamp -- where he creates this light that he could only make because there's also dark.
And I think that is the quintessence of this 18-minute talk -- that there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well-being without proper darkness.
So this is how we normally would light our offices.
We have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much lux and of great uniformity.
This is how we create uniform lighting from one wall to the other in a regular grid of lamps.
And that is quite different from what I just showed you from Le Corbusier.
If we would apply these codes and standards to the Pantheon in Rome, it would never have looked like this, because this beautiful light feature can only appear because there is also darkness in that same building.
And the same is more or less what Santiago Calatrava said when he said, "Light: I make it in my buildings for comfort."
And he didn't mean the comfort of a five-course dinner as opposed to a one-course meal, but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people.
He meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun.
And he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky, and where you can experience the sun, that give us a better life in the built environment, just because of the relevance of light in its brightness and also in its shadows.
What it all boils down to is, of course, the sun.
And this image of the sun may suggest that the sun is something evil and aggressive, but we should not forget that all energy on this planet actually comes from the sun, and light is only a manifestation of that energy.
The sun is for dynamics, for color changes.
The sun is for beauty in our environment, like in this building -- the High Museum in Atlanta, which has been created by Renzo Piano from Italy, together with Arup Lighting, a brilliant team of lighting designers, who created a very subtle modulation of light across the space, responding to what the sun does outside, just because of all these beautiful openings in the roof.
So in an indirect way, you can see the sun.
And what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum.
They created this shade that you can see here, which actually covers the sun, but opens up to the good light from the sky.
And here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models, with quantitative, as well as qualitative, methods to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture.
They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way.
As you can see here, there's some direct light on the floor, but they could easily figure out where that comes from.
And they allow people in that building to really enjoy the sun, the good part of the sun.
And enjoying the sun can be in many different ways, of course.
It can be just like this, or maybe like this, which is rather peculiar, but this is in 1963 -- the viewing of a sun eclipse in the United States.
And it's just a bit bright up there, so these people have found a very intriguing solution.
This is, I think, a very illustrative image of what I try to say -- that the beautiful dynamics of sun, bringing these into the building, creates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives.
And this is all about darkness as much as it is about lightness, of course, because otherwise you don't see these dynamics.
As opposed to the first office that I showed you in the beginning of the talk, this is a well-known office, which is the White Group.
They are in green energy consulting, or something like that.
And they really practice what they preach because this office doesn't have any electric lighting at all.
It has only on one side this big, big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range.
So it can be very dim over there, and you do your work, and it can be very bright over there, and you do your work.
But actually the human eye turns out to be remarkably adaptable to all these different light conditions that together create an environment that is never boring and that is never dull, and therefore helps us to enhance our lives.
I really owe a short introduction of this man to you.
This is Richard Kelly who was born 100 years ago, which is the reason I bring him up now, because it's kind of an anniversary year.
In the 1930s, Richard Kelly was the first person to really describe a methodology of modern lighting design.
And he coined three terms, which are "focal glow," "ambient luminescence" and "play of the brilliants" -- three very distinctly different ideas about light in architecture that all together make up this beautiful experience.
So you begin with focal glow.
He meant something like this -- where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around.
Or something like this, which is the lighting design he did for General Motors, for the car showroom.
And you enter that space, and you feel like, "Wow! This is so impressive," just because of this focal point, this huge light source in the middle.
To me it is something from theatre, and I will get back to that a little bit later.
It's the spotlight on the artist that helps you to focus.
It could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and lights up a patch of the land, highlighting it compared to the dim environment.
lighting the merchandise and creating accents that help you to get around.
Ambient luminescence is something very different.
Richard Kelly saw it as something infinite, something without any focus, something where all details actually dissolve in infinity.
And I see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to relax and to contemplate.
It could also be something like this: the National Museum of Science in London, where this blue is embracing all the exhibitions and galleries And then finally, Kelly's play of brilliants attitude, that really some play of the skyline of Hong Kong, or perhaps the chandelier in the opera house, or in the theater here, which is a decoration, the icing on the cake, something playful, something that is just an addition to the architectural environment, I would say.
These three distinct elements, together, make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better.
And we can only create these out of darkness.
And I will explain that further.
And I guess that is something that Richard Kelly, here on the left, was explaining to Ludwig Mies Van der Rohe.
And behind them, you see that Seagram Building that later turned into an icon of modern lighting design.
Those times, there were some early attempts also for light therapy already.
You can see here a photo from the United States Library of Medicine, where people are put in the sun to get better.
It's a little bit of a different story, this health aspect of light, than what I'm telling you today.
In today's modern medicine, there is a real understanding of light in an almost biochemical way.
And there is the idea that, when we look at things, it is the yellow light that helps us the most, that we are the most sensitive for.
But our circadian rhythms, which are the rhythms that help us to wake and sleep and be alert and relaxed and so forth and so on, they are much more triggered by blue light.
And by modulating the amount of blue in our environment, we can help people to relax, or to be alert, to fall asleep, or to stay awake.
And that is how, maybe in the near future, light can help hospitals to make people better sooner, recover them quicker.
Maybe in the airplane, we can overcome jet lag like that.
Perhaps in school, we can help children to learn better because they concentrate more on their work.
And you can imagine a lot more applications.
But I would like to talk further about the combination of light and darkness as a quality in our life.
So light is, of course, for social interaction also -- to create relationships with all the features around us.
It is the place where we gather around when we have to say something to each other.
And it is all about this planet.
But when you look at this planet at night, it looks like this.
And I think this is the most shocking image in my talk today.
Because all this light here goes up to the sky.
It never reaches the ground where it was meant for.
It never is to the benefit of people.
It only spoils the darkness.
So at a global scale, it looks like this.
And, I mean, that is quite amazing, what you see here -- how much light goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground.
Because if we look at the Earth the way it should be, it would be something like this very inspiring image where darkness is for our imagination and for contemplation and to help us to relate to everything.
The world is changing though, and urbanization is a big driver of everything.
I took this photo two weeks ago in Guangzhou, and I realized that 10 years ago, there was nothing like this, of these buildings.
It was just a much smaller city, and the pace of urbanization is incredible and enormous.
And we have to understand these main questions: How do people move through these new urban spaces?
How do they share their culture?
How do we tackle things like mobility?
And how can light help there?
Because the new technologies, they seem to be in a really interesting position to contribute to the solutions of urbanization and to provide us with better environments.
It's not that long ago that our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps.
And of course, we had the metal halide lamps and fluorescent lamps Now we have LED, but here you see the latest one, and you see how incredibly small it is.
And this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity because this tiny, tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it.
And we can actually leave it out where it's not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness.
So that is a really interesting proposition, I think, and a new way of lighting the architectural environment with our well-being in mind.
The problem is though that I wanted to explain to you how this really works -- but I can have four of these on my finger, so you would not to be able to really see them.
So I asked our laboratory to do something about it, and they said, "Well, we can do something."
They created for me the biggest LED in the world especially for TEDx in Amsterdam.
So here it is.
It's the same thing as you can see over there -- just 200 times bigger.
And I will very quickly show you how it works.
So just to explain.
Now, every LED that is made these days gives blue light.
Now this is not very pleasant and comfortable.
And for that reason, we cover the LED with a phosphor cap.
And the phosphor is excited by the blue and makes the light white and warm and pleasant.
And then when you add the lens to that, you can bundle the light and send it to wherever you need it without any need to spill any light to the sky or anywhere else.
So you can preserve the darkness and make the light.
I just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works.
Thank you.
We can go further.
So we have to rethink the way we light our cities.
We have to think again about light as a default solution.
Why are all these motorways permanently lit?
Is it really needed?
Can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness?
Can we be more gentle with light?
Like here -- this is a very low light level actually.
Can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create, so they really want to connect with it, like here?
Or can we create simply sculptures that are very inspiring to be in and to be around?
And can we preserve the darkness?
Because to find a place like this today on Earth is really very, very challenging.
And to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult.
Even in the oceans, we are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for animal life to have a much greater well-being.
And it's known that migrating birds, for example, get very disoriented because of these offshore platforms.
And we discovered that, when we make those lights green, the birds, they actually go the right way.
They are not disturbed anymore.
And it turns out once again that spectral sensitivity is very important here.
In all of these examples, I think, we should start making the light out of darkness, and use the darkness as a canvas -- like the visual artists do, like Edward Hopper in this painting.
I think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting.
I think, when I see it, I start to think, who are those people?
Where have they come from? Where are they going?
What just happened? What will be happening in the next five minutes?
And it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light.
Edward Hopper was a real master in creating the narration by working with light and dark.
And we can learn from that and create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments.
We can do that in commercial spaces like this.
And you can still also go outside and enjoy the greatest show in the universe, which is, of course, the universe itself.
So I give you this wonderful, informative image of the sky, ranging from the inner city, where you may see one or two stars and nothing else, all the way to the rural environments, where you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance of the constellations and the stars.
In architecture, it works just the same.
By appreciating the darkness when you design the light, you create much more interesting environments that truly enhance our lives.
This is the most well-known example, Tadao Ando's Church of Light.
But I also think of Peter Zumthor's spa in Vals, where light and dark, in very gentle combinations, alter each other to define the space.
Or Richard McCormack's Southern tube station in London, where you can really see the sky, even though you are under the ground.
And finally I want to point out that a lot of this inspiration comes from theater.
And I think it's fantastic that we are today experiencing TEDx in a theater for the first time because I think we really owe to the theater a big thanks.
It wouldn't be such an inspiring scenography without this theater.
And I think the theater is a place where we truly enhance life with light.
Thank you very much.

<title>Rogier van der Heide: Why light needs darkness</title>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/anil_gupta_india_s_hidden_hotbeds_of_invention.html</url>
I bring to you a message from tens of thousands of people -- in the villages, in the slums, in the hinterland of the country -- who have solved problems through their own genius, without any outside help.
When our home minister announces a few weeks ago a war on one third of India, about 200 districts that he mentioned were ungovernable, he missed the point.
The point that we have been stressing for the last 21 years, the point that people may be economically poor, but they're not poor in the mind.
In other words, the minds on the margin are not the marginal minds.
That is the message, which we started 31 years ago.
And what did it start?
Let me just tell you, briefly, my personal journey, which led me to come to this point.
In '85, '86, I was in Bangladesh advising the government and the research council there how to help scientists work on the lands, on the fields of the poor people, and how to develop research technologies, which are based on the knowledge of the people.
I came back in '86.
I had been tremendously invigorated by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country, which had 60 percent landlessness but amazing creativity.
I started looking at my own work: The work that I had done for the previous 10 years, almost every time, that people had shared.
Now, I was paid in dollars as a consultant, and I looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself: "Is there a line in my return, which shows how much of this income has gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible?
Was it because I'm brilliant that I'm getting this reward, or because of the revolution?
Is it that I write very well?
Is it that I articulate very well?
Is it that I analyze the data very well?
Is it because I'm a professor, and, therefore, I must be entitled to this reward from society?"
I tried to convince myself that, "No, no, I have worked for the policy changes.
You know, the public policy will become more responsive to the needs of the poor, and, therefore I think it's okay."
But it appeared to me that all these years that I'd been working on exploitation -- exploitation by landlords, by moneylenders, by traders -- gave me an insight that probably I was also an exploiter, because there was no line in my income tax return which showed this income accrued because of the brilliance of the people -- those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me -- and nothing ever went back to them.
So much so, that much of my work till that time was in the English language.
The majority of the people from whom I learned didn't know English.
So what kind of a contributor was I?
I was talking about social justice, and here I was, a professional who was pursuing the most unjust act -- of taking knowledge from the people, making them anonymous, getting rent from that knowledge by sharing it and doing consultancy, writing papers and publishing them in the papers, getting invited to the conferences, getting consultancies and whatever have you.
So then, a dilemma rose in the mind that, if I'm also an exploiter, then this is not right; life cannot go on like that.
And this was a moment of great pain and trauma because I couldn't live with it any longer.
So I did a review of ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research, wrote, read about 100 papers.
And I came to the conclusion that while dilemma is unique, dilemma is not unique; the solution had to be unique.
And one day -- I don't know what happened -- while coming back from the office towards home, maybe I saw a honey bee or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee, life would be wonderful.
What the honey bee does: it pollinates, takes nectar from the flower, pollinates another flower, cross-pollinates.
And when it takes the nectar, the flowers don't feel shortchanged.
In fact, they invite the honey bees through their colors, and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves.
These are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network: that whenever we learn something from people it must be shared with them in their language.
They must not remain anonymous.
And I must tell you that after 20 years, I have not made one percent of change in the professional practice of this art.
That is a great tragedy -- which I'm carrying still with me and I hope that all of you will carry this with you -- that the profession still legitimizes publication of knowledge of people without attributing them by making them anonymous.
The research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences or Research Councils of the U.K.
or of Indian Councils of Science Research do not require that whatever you learn from people, you must share back with them.
We are talking about an accountable society, a society that is fair and just, and we don't even do justice in the knowledge market.
And India wants to be a knowledge society.
How will it be a knowledge society?
So, obviously, you cannot have two principles of justice, one for yourself and one for others.
It must be the same.
You cannot discriminate.
You cannot be in favor of your own values, which are at a distance from the values that you espouse.
So, fairness to one and to the other is not divisible.
Look at this picture.
Can you tell me where has it been taken from, and what is it meant for? Anybody?
I'm a professor; I must quiz you.
Anybody? Any guess at all?
Pardon?
Anil Gupta: But what has it been used for? What has it been used for?
Pardon?
You know, you're so right. We must give him a hand, because this man knows how insensitive our government is.
Look at this. This is the site of the government of India.
It invites tourists to see the shame of our country.
I'm so sorry to say that.
Is this a beautiful picture or is it a terrible picture?
It depends upon how you look at the life of the people.
If this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles, you cannot be celebrating that.
We should be doing something about it.
And let me tell you, with all the science and technology at our command, millions of women still carry water on their heads.
And we do not ask this question.
You must have taken tea in the morning.
Think for a minute.
The leaves of the tea, plucked from the bushes; you know what the action is? The action is: The lady picks up a few leaves, puts them in the basket on the backside.
Just do it 10 times; you will realize the pain in this shoulder.
And she does it a few thousand times every day.
The rice that you ate in the lunch, and you will eat today, is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture, millions of them, every season, in the paddy season, when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water.
And feet in the water will develop fungus, infections, and that infection pains because then other insects bite that point.
And every year, 99.9 percent of the paddy is transplanted manually.
No machines have been developed.
So the silence of scientists, of technologists, of public policy makers, of the change agent, drew our attention that this is not on, this is not on; this is not the way society will work.
This is not what our parliament would do. You know, we have a program for employment: One hundred, 250 million people have to be given jobs for 100 days by this great country.
Doing what? Breaking stones, digging earth.
So we asked a question to the parliament: Do poor have heads?
Do poor have legs, mouth and hands, but no head?
So Honey Bee Network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich.
And what has happened?
An anonymous, faceless, nameless person gets in contact with the network, and then gets an identity.
This is what Honey Bee Network is about.
And this network grew voluntarily, continues to be voluntary, and has tried to map the minds of millions of people of our country and other parts of the world who are creative.
They could be creative in terms of education, they may be creative in terms of culture, they may be creative in terms of institutions; but a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity, the innovations, either in terms of contemporary innovations, or in terms of traditional knowledge.
And it all begins with curiosity.
It all begins with curiosity.
This person, whom we met -- and you will see it on the website, www.sristi.org -- this tribal person, he had a wish.
And he said, "If my wish gets fulfilled" -- somebody was sick and he had to monitor -- "God, please cure him.
And if you cure him, I will get my wall painted."
And this is what he got painted.
Somebody was talking yesterday about Maslowian hierarchy.
There could be nothing more wrong than the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment.
Kabir, Rahim, all the great Sufi saints, they were all poor people, and they had a great reason.
Please do not ever think that only after meeting your physiological needs and other needs can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment.
Any person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment, only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something.
Look at this.
We saw it in Shodh Yatra. Every six months we walk in different parts of the country.
I've walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years.
So on the wayside we found these dung cakes, which are used as a fuel.
Now, this lady, on the wall of the dung cake heap, has made a painting.
That's the only space she could express her creativity.
And she's so marvelous.
Look at this lady, Ram Timari Devi, on a grain bin. In Champaran, we had a Shodh Yatra and we were walking in the land where Gandhiji went to hear about the tragedy, pain of indigo growers.
Bhabi Mahato in Purulia and Bankura.
Look at what she has done.
The whole wall is her canvas. She's sitting there with a broom.
Is she an artisan or an artist?
Obviously she's an artist; she's a creative person.
If we can create markets for these artists, we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones.
They will be paid for what they are good at, not what they're bad at.
Look at what Rojadeen has done.
In Motihari in Champaran, there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack and, obviously, there's a limited market for tea.
Every morning you have tea, as well as coffee.
So he thought, why don't I convert a pressure cooker into a coffee machine?
So this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees.
People bring their own cooker, he attaches a valve and a steam pipe, and now he gives you espresso coffee.
Now, this is a real, affordable coffee percolator that works on gas.
Look at what Sheikh Jahangir has done.
A lot of poor people do not have enough grains to get ground.
So this fellow is bringing a flour-grinding machine on a two-wheeler.
If you have 500 grams, 1000, one kilogram, he will grind it for it for you; the flourmill will not grind such a small quantity.
Please understand the problem of poor people.
They have needs which have to be met efficiently in terms of energy, in terms of cost, in terms of quality.
They don't want second-standard, second-quality outputs.
But to be able to give them high-quality output you need to adapt technology to their needs.
And that is what Sheikh Jahangir did.
But that's not enough, what he did. Look at what he did here.
If you have clothes, and you don't have enough time to wash them, he brought a washing machine to your doorstep, mounted on a two-wheeler.
So here's a model where a two-wheeler washing machine ...
He is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep.
You bring your water, you bring your soap, I wash the clothes for you. Charge 50 paisa, one rupee for you per lot, and a new business model can emerge.
Now, what we need is, we need people who will be able to scale them up.
Look at this.
It looks like a beautiful photograph.
But you know what it is? Can anybody guess what it is?
Somebody from India would know, of course.
It's a tawa.
It's a hot plate made of clay.
Now, what is the beauty in it?
When you have a non-stick pan, it costs about, maybe, 250 rupees, five dollars, six dollars.
This is less than a dollar and this is non-stick; it is coated with one of these food-grade materials.
And the best part is that, while you use a costly non-stick pan, you eat the so-called Teflon or Teflon-like material because after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone?
It has gone in your stomach. It was not meant for that.
You know? But here in this clay hot plate, it will never go into your stomach.
So it is better, it is safer; it is affordable, it is energy-efficient.
In other words, solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper, need not be, so-called, jugaad, need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement.
They have to be better, they have to be more efficient, they have to be affordable.
And that is what Mansukh Bhai Prajapati has done.
He has designed this plate with a handle.
And now with one dollar, you can afford a better alternative than the people market is offering you.
This lady, she developed a herbal pesticide formulation.
We filed the patent for her, the National Innovation Foundation.
And who knows? Somebody will license this technology and develop marketable products, and she would get revenue.
Now, let me mention one thing: I think we need a polycentric model of development, where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country, in different parts of the world, would solve the needs of locality in a very efficient and adaptive manner.
Higher the local fit, greater is the chance of scaling up.
In the scaling up, there's an inherent inadequacy to match the needs of the local people, point by point, with the supply that you're making.
So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch?
Things can scale up, and they have scaled up.
For example, cell phones: We have 400 million cellphones in this country.
Now, it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone, only three options on the cellphone.
It has 300 options, I'm paying for 300; I'm using only three but I'm willing to live with it, therefore it is scaling up.
But if I had to get a match to match, obviously, I would need a different design of a cellphone.
So what we're saying is that scalability should not become an enemy of sustainability.
There must be a place in the world for solutions that are only relevant for a locality, and yet, one can be able to fund them.
One of the greatest studies that we've been finding is that many times investors would ask this question -- "What is a scalable model?" -- as if the need of a community, which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places, has no legitimate right to get them for free because it's not part of a larger scale.
So either you sub-optimize your needs to a larger scale or else you remain out.
Now, the eminent model, the long-tail model tells you that small sales of a large number of books, for example, having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model.
And we must find a mechanism where people will pool in the portfolio, will invest in the portfolio, where different innovations will go to a small number of people in their localities, and yet, the overall platform of the model will become viable.
Look at what he is doing.
Saidullah Sahib is an amazing man.
At the age of 70, he is linking up something very creative.
Saidullah Sahib: I couldn't wait for the boat.
I had to meet my love.
My desperation made me an innovator.
Even love needs help from technology.
Innovation is the light of my wife, Noor.
New inventions are the passion of my life.
My technology.
AG: Saidulluh Sahib is in Motihari, again in Champaran.
Wonderful human being, but he stills sells, at this age, honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood, because we haven't been able to convince the water park people, the lake people, in [unclear] operations.
And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people in Mumbai -- where there was a flood a few years ago and people had to walk 20 kilometers, wading in the water -- that, look, you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office because you can then go to those lanes where your buses will not go, where your transport will not go.
So we have not yet cracked the problem of making it available as a rescue device, as a vending device during the floods in eastern India, when you have to deliver things to people in different islands where they're marooned.
But the idea has a merit. The idea has a merit.
What has Appachan done? Appachan, unfortunately, is no more, but he has left behind a message.
A very powerful message Appachan: I watch the world wake up every day.
It's not that a coconut fell on my head, and I came upon this idea.
With no money to fund my studies, I scaled new heights.
Now, they call me the local Spiderman.
My technology.
AG: Many of you might not realize and believe that we have sold this product internationally -- what I call a G2G model, grassroots to global.
And a professor in the University of Massachusetts, in the zoology department, bought this climber because she wanted to study the insect diversity of the top of the tree canopy.
And this device makes it possible for her to take samples from a larger number of palms, rather than only a few, because otherwise she had to make a big platform and then climb her [unclear] would climb on that.
So, you know, we are advancing the frontiers of science.
Remya Jose has developed ...
you can go to the YouTube and find India Innovates and then you will find these videos.
Innovation by her when she was in class 10th: a washing machine-cum-exercising machine.
Mr. Kharai who is a physically challenged person, one and a half foot height, only.
But he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and flexibility.
This innovation is from the slums of Rio.
And this person, Mr. Ubirajara.
We were talking about, my friends in Brazil, how we scale up this model in China and Brazil.
And we have a very vibrant network in China, particularly, but also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world.
This stand on the front wheel, you will not find on any cycle.
India and China have the largest number of cycles.
But this innovation emerged in Brazil.
The point is, none of us should be parochial, none of us should be so nationalistic to believe that all good ideas will come only from our country.
No, we have to have the humility to learn from knowledge of economically poor people, wherever they are.
And look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations: cycle that's a sprayer, cycle that generates energy from the shocks on the road.
I can't change the condition of the road, but I can make the cycle run faster.
That is what Kanak Das has done.
And in South Africa, we had taken our innovators, and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa as to how innovation can become a means of liberation from the drudgery that people have.
And this is a donkey cart which they modified.
There's an axle here, of 30, 40 kg, serving no purpose.
Remove it, the cart needs one donkey less.
This is in China. This girl needed a breathing apparatus.
These three people in the village sat down and decided to think, "How do we elongate the life of this girl of our village?"
They were not related to her, but they tried to find out, "How can we use ... " They used a cycle, they put together a breathing apparatus.
And this breathing apparatus now saved the life, and she's very welcome.
There's a whole range of innovations that we have.
A car, which runs on compressed air with six paisa per kilometer.
Assam, Kanak Gogoi.
And you would not find this car in U.S. or Europe, but this is available in India.
Now, this lady, she used to do the winding of the yarn for Pochampally Saree.
In one day, 18,000 times, she had to do this winding to generate two sarees.
This is what her son has done after seven years of struggle.
She said, "Change your profession."
He said, "I can't. This is the only thing I know, but I'll invent a machine, which will solve your problem."
And this is what he did, a sewing machine in Uttar Pradesh.
So, this is what SRISTI is saying: "Give me a place to stand, and I will move the world."
I will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children for creativity, a whole range of things.
We have sold things all over the world, from Ethiopia to Turkey to U.S. to wherever.
Products have gone to the market, a few.
These are the people whose knowledge made this Herbavate cream for eczema possible.
And here, a company which licensed this herbal pesticide put a photograph of the innovator on the packing so that every time a user uses it, it asks the user, "You can also be an innovator.
If you have an idea, send it back to us."
So, creativity counts, knowledge matters, innovations transform, incentives inspire.
And incentives: not just material, but also non-material incentives.
Thank you.

<title>Anil Gupta: India's hidden hotbeds of invention</title>
<description>Anil Gupta is on the hunt for the developing world's unsung inventors -- indigenous entrepreneurs whose ingenuity, hidden by poverty, could change many people's lives. He shows how the Honey Bee Network helps them build the connections they need -- and gain the recognition they deserve.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/dean_kamen_on_inventing_and_giving.html</url>
As you pointed out, every time you come here, you learn something.
This morning, the world's experts from I guess three or four different companies on building seats, I think concluded that ultimately, the solution is, people shouldn't sit down.
I could have told them that.
Yesterday, the automotive guys gave us some new insights.
They pointed out that, I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today, they will be steering cars by wire, without all that mechanical stuff.
That's reassuring.
They then pointed out that there'd be, sort of, the other controls by wire, to get rid of all that mechanical stuff.
That's pretty good, but why not get rid of the wires?
Then you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it.
I would love to talk about the technology, and sometime, in what's past the 15 minutes, I'll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here about what's in here.
But if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first, it would be that from the time we started building this, the big idea wasn't the technology.
It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the iBOT for the disabled community.
The big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation.
And maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this, I'll be happy to give it to you in different forms.
You never know what strikes the fancy of whom, but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world.
And Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts.
What I don't think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied.
For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns.
So, the car -- the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal; it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage.
It was half as long.
And it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance, in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan, because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses, and a million of them urinating and doing other things, and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable.
So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy.
It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm, or their farm to a town, or from a town to a city.
It all made sense, with 91 percent of the people living there.
By the 1950s, we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world, the highway system.
And it is certainly a wonder.
And by the way, as I take shots at old technologies, I want to assure everybody, and particularly the automotive industry -- who's been very supportive of us -- that I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes, or cars.
But think about where the world is today.
50 percent of the global population now lives in cities.
That's 3.2 billion people.
We've solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today.
500 years ago, sailing ships started getting reliable enough; we found a new continent.
150 years ago, locomotives got efficient enough, steam power, that we turned the continent into a country.
Over the last hundred years, we started building cars, and then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way, and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that.
But during that entire process, more and more people have been born, and more and more people are moving to cities.
China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half.
And so, nobody, I think, would argue that airplanes, in the last 50 years, have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood.
And if you just look at how technology has been applied, we've solved all the long-range, high-speed, high-volume, large-weight problems of moving things around.
Nobody would want to give them up.
And I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane, or my helicopter, or my Humvee, or my Porsche.
I love them all. I don't keep any of them in my living room.
The fact is, the last mile is the problem, and half the world now lives in dense cities.
And people spend, depending on who they are, between 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot.
I think there's -- I don't know what data would impress you, but how about, 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States.
Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air, and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices, particularly sitting in cities.
And again, I say that not to attack any industry, I think -- I really do -- I love my airplane, and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient, both from an engineering point of view, an energy consumption point of view, and a utility point of view.
And we all love our cars, and I do.
The problem is, you get into the city and you want to go four blocks, it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive.
It's not sustainable.
If -- in China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles; 1.7 million people used cars.
If five percent of that population became, quote, middle class, and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks -- it isn't sustainable environmentally; it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil -- and it's not sustainable politically.
I mean, what are we fighting over right now?
We can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over right now?
So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile, and it was dumb luck. We were working on iBOTs, but once we made this, we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis. You don't need the water.
Or snowmobiles. You don't need the snow.
Or skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things.
And every one of those industries, by the way -- just golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry.
But rather than go license this off, which is what we normally do, it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology, but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems, but has somehow come to accept that cities -- which, right back from ancient Greece on, were meant to walk around, cities that were architected and built for people -- now have a footprint that, while we've solved every other transportation problem -- and it's like Moore's law.
I mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon, then on a railroad, then an airplane.
Every other form of transportation's been improved.
In 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities.
They've gotten bigger; they're spread out.
The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city -- Wilshire Boulevard, or Fifth Avenue, or Tokyo, or Paris -- the most expensive real estate is their downtowns.
65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars.
The 20 largest cities in the world.
So you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities?
What if you could make them fun, attractive, clean, environmentally friendly?
What if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this, as that last link to mass transit, to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want, and then have our cities energized again?
We thought it would be really neat to do that, and one of the problems we really were worried about is: how do we get legal on the sidewalk?
Because technically I've got motors; I've got wheels -- I'm a motor vehicle.
I don't look like a motor vehicle.
I have the same footprint as a pedestrian; I have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space.
I took this down to Ground Zero, and knocked my way through crowds for an hour.
I'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two, and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices.
We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter, and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff.
Or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle.
We've been so concerned about that, we went to the Postmaster General of the United States, as the first person we ever showed on the outside, and said, "Put your people on it. Everybody trusts their postman.
And they belong on the sidewalks, and they'll use it seriously."
He agreed. We went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat, carrying 70 pounds of stuff. They love it.
And I can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket.
So we've been working really, really hard, but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what's important, and how to apply the technology.
We went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to let us design and build these things, and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted.
So, I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want.
And yes, it's really fun, and yes, you should all go out and try it.
But if I could ask you to do one thing, it's not to think about it as a piece of technology, but just imagine that, although we all understand somehow that it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine, which can go 60 miles an hour, that can bring you everywhere you want to go, and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile, and it's broken, and it doesn't work.
One of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted, happened out here in California.
A few weeks ago, after we launched it, we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach, zipping up and back, and he's marveling at the technology, and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by, and skateboarders are zipping by, and a little old lady -- I mean, if you looked in the dictionary, a little old lady -- came by me -- and now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now -- and she just stops, and the camera is there, and she looks up at me and says, "Can I try that?"
And what was I -- you know, how are you going to say anything?
And so I said, "Sure."
So I get off, and she gets on, and with a little bit of the usual, ah, then she turns around, and she goes about 20 feet, and she turns back around, and she's all smiles.
And she comes back to me and she stops, and she says, "Finally, they made something for us."
And the camera is looking down at her.
I'm thinking, "Wow, that was great -- -- please lady, don't say another word."
And the camera is down at her, and this guy has to put the microphone in her face, said, "What do you mean by that?"
And I figured, "It's all over now," and she looks up and she says, "Well," she's still watching these guys go; she says, "I can't ride a bike," no, she says, "I can't use a skateboard, and I've never used roller blades," she knew them by name; she says, "And it's been 50 years since I rode a bicycle."
Then she looks up, she's looking up, and she says, "And I'm 81 years old, and I don't drive a car anymore.
I still have to get to the store, and I can't carry a lot of things."
And it suddenly occurred to me, that among my many fears, were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it -- it was that, fundamentally, you believe there's pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left, the sidewalks in these cities.
When you look at the 36 inches of legal requirement for sidewalk, then the eight foot for the parked car, then the three lanes, and then the other eight feet -- it's -- that little piece is all that's there.
But she looks up and says this, and it occurs to me, well, kids aren't going to mind these things, and they don't vote, and business people and then young adults aren't going to mind these things -- they're pretty cool -- so I guess subliminally I was worried that it's the older population that's going to worry.
So, having seen this, and having worried about it for eight years, the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys, call AARP, get an appointment right away.
We've got to show them this thing.
And they took it to Washington; they showed them; and they're going to be involved now, watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities, like Atlanta, where we're doing trials to see if it really can, in fact, help re-energize their downtown.
The bottom line is, whether you believe the United Nations, or any of the other think tanks -- in the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planet will be in cities.
In Asia alone, it will be over a billion people.
They learned to start with cell phones.
They didn't have to take the 100-year trip we took.
They start at the top of the technology food chain.
We've got to start building cities and human environments where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense, rich, green-space environment, without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it.
Cars were not meant for parallel parking; they're wonderful machines to go between cities, but just think about it: we've solved all the long-range, high-speed problems.
The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals.
You do it in your sneakers.
Not much has changed.
If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times -- a 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes.
Your choice, when living in a city, if it's now 10 minutes -- because at 30 minutes you want an alternative, whether it's a bus, a train -- we've got to build an infrastructure -- a light rail -- or you're going to keep parking those cars.
But if you could put a pin in most cities, and imagine how far you could, if you had the time, walk in one half-hour, it's the city.
If you could make it fun, and make it eight or 10 minutes, you can't find your car, un-park your car, move your car, re-park your car and go somewhere; you can't get to a cab or a subway.
We could change the way people allocate their resources, the way this planet uses its energy, make it more fun.
And we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right.
That's Segway. This is a Stirling cycle engine; this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing.
This little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity.
Yes, it could be attached to this, and yes, on a kilogram of propane, you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose.
Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it'll burn any fuel, because some of you might be skeptical about the capability of this to have an impact, where most of the world you can't simply plug into your 120-volt outlet.
We've been working on this, actually, as an alternative energy source, starting way back with Johnson &amp; Johnson, to run an iBOT, because the best batteries you could get -- 10 watt-hours per kilogram in lead, 20 watt-hours per kilogram nickel-cadmium, 40 watt-hours per kilogram in nickel-metal hydride, 60 watt-hours per kilogram in lithium, 8,750 watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline -- which is why nobody drives electric cars.
But, in any event, if you can burn it with the same efficiency -- because it's external combustion -- as your kitchen stove, if you can burn any fuel, it turns out to be pretty neat.
It makes just enough electricity to, for instance, do this, which at night is enough electricity, in the rest of the world, as Mr. Holly -- Dr. Holly -- pointed out, can run computers and a light bulb.
But more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say, you're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency.
It doesn't matter much -- it says if you get 200 watts of electricity, you'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat.
If you wanted to boil water and re-condense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour, it takes about 25, a little over 25.3 kilowatt -- 25,000 watts of continuous power -- to do it.
That's so much energy, you couldn't afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way.
Certainly, in the rest of the world, your choice is to devastate the place, turning everything that will burn into heat, or drink the water that's available.
The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water.
Depending on whose numbers you believe, it's between 60 and 85,000 people per day.
We don't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world.
We need water.
And women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it, or watching their kids die.
We figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing, with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat, then using a little bit of the electricity control that process, and for 450 watts, which is a little more than half of its waste heat, it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it.
So if we put this box on here in a few years, could we have a solution to transportation, electricity, and communication, and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds?
I don't know, but we'll try it.
I better shut up.

I'd like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo, who was put to sleep a couple of days ago, because he got too old.
But apparently he was a very nice dog and he always let the cat sleep in the dog bed.
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. I'm just a'walking my dog, singing my song, strolling along. Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong. My life was lonely and blue. Yeah, I was sad as a sailor, I was an angry 'un too. Then there was you -- appeared when I was entangled with youth and fear, and nerves jingle jangled, vermouth and beer were getting me mangled up. But then I looked in your eyes and I was no more a failure. You looked so wacky and wise. And I said, "Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I'm just a'walking my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong." Yeah, it's just me and my dog, singing our song, strolling along. 'Cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt, and I don't care what the politicians spout. If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound, and find yourself a hound, and make that doggie proud, 'cause that's what it's all about. Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. My life was tragic and sad. I was the archetypal loser. I was a pageant gone bad. And then there was you -- on time, and wagging your tail in the cutest mime that you was in jail. I said, "Woof, be mine!" and you gave a wail and then I was no longer alone. And I was no more a boozer. We'll make the happiest home. And I said, "Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I'm just a'walking my dog, singing my song, strolling along." Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong, 'cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt, and I don't care what the politicians spout. If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound, and find yourself a hound, and make that doggie proud, 'cause that's what it's all about, that's what it's all about, that's what it's all abou-BOW-WOW-WOW-WOW that's what it's all about. Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. Good dog!
Thank you.

In December of 2010, the city of Apatzingán in the coastal state of Michoacán, in Mexico, awoke to gunfire.
For two straight days, the city became an open battlefield between the federal forces and a well-organized group, presumably from the local criminal organization, La Familia Michoacana, or the Michoacán family.
The citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire but also explosions and burning trucks used as barricades across the city, so truly like a battlefield.
After these two days, and during a particularly intense encounter, it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana, Nazario Moreno, was killed.
In response to this terrifying violence, the mayor of Apatzingán decided to call the citizens to a march for peace.
The idea was to ask for a softer approach to criminal activity in the state.
And so, the day of the scheduled procession, thousands of people showed up.
As the mayor was preparing to deliver the speech starting the march, his team noticed that, while half of the participants were appropriately dressed in white, and bearing banners asking for peace, the other half was actually marching in support of the criminal organization and its now-presumed-defunct leader.
Shocked, the mayor decided to step aside rather than participate or lead a procession that was ostensibly in support of organized crime.
And so his team stepped aside.
The two marches joined together, and they continued their path towards the state capital.
This story of horrific violence followed by a fumbled approach by federal and local authorities as they tried to engage civil society, who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization, is a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today, where we see that our current understanding of drug violence and what leads to it is probably at the very least incomplete.
If you decided to spend 30 minutes trying to figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico by, say, just researching online, the first thing you would find out is that while the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal, there are some that are more and there are some that are much less equal than others, because you will quickly find out that in the past six years anywhere between 60 and 100,000 people have lost their lives in drug-related violence.
To put these numbers in perspective, this is eight times larger than the number of casualties in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.
It's also shockingly close to the number of people who have died in the Syrian civil war, which is an active civil war.
This is happening just south of the border.
Now as you're reading, however, you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly become numb to the numbers of deaths, because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers of faceless, nameless dead people.
Implicitly or explicitly, there is a narrative that all the people who are dying were somehow involved in the drug trade, and we infer this because they were either tortured or executed in a professional manner, or, most likely, both.
And so clearly they were criminals because of the way they died.
And so the narrative is that somehow these people got what they were deserved.
They were part of the bad guys.
And that creates some form of comfort for a lot of people.
However, while it's easier to think of us, the citizens, the police, the army, as the good guys, and them, the narcos, the carteles, as the bad guys, if you think about it, the latter are only providing a service to the former.
Whether we like it or not, the U.S. is the largest market for illegal substances in the world, accounting for more than half of global demand.
It shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico that is its only route of access from the South, and so, as the former dictator of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz, used to say, "Poor Mexico, so far from God and so close to the United States."
The U.N. estimates that there are 55 million users of illegal drugs in the United States.
Using very, very conservative assumptions, this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side of anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars.
If we assume that the narcos only have access to the wholesale part, which we know is false, that still leaves you with yearly revenues of anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars.
To put these numbers in perspective, Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.
And it so happens that this is a product that, because of its nature, a business model to address this market requires you to guarantee to your producers that their product will be reliably placed in the markets where it is consumed.
And the only way to do this, because it's illegal, is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors that are used to transport drugs.
Hence the violence.
If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence, you will see that it almost perfectly aligns with the most efficient routes of transportation from the south to the north.
is that they're trying to protect their business.
It's not only a multi-billion dollar market, but it's also a complex one.
For example, the coca plant is a fragile plant that can only grow in certain latitudes, and so it means that a business model to address this market requires you to have decentralized, international production, that by the way needs to have good quality control, because people need a good high that is not going to kill them and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it.
And so that means they need to secure production and quality control in the south, and you need to ensure that you have efficient and effective distribution channels in the markets where these drugs are consumed.
I urge you, but only a little bit, because I don't want to get you in trouble, to just ask around and see how difficult it would be to get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it, whenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S., and some of you may be surprised to know that there are many dealers that offer a service where if you send them a text message, they guarantee delivery of the drug in 30 minutes or less.
Think about this for a second.
Think about the complexity of the distribution network that I just described.
It's very difficult to reconcile this with the image of faceless, ignorant goons that are just shooting each other, very difficult to reconcile.
Now, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you, an effective organization requires an integrated strategy that includes a good organizational structure, good incentives, a solid identity and good brand management.
This leads me to the second thing that you would learn in your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico.
Because you would quickly realize, and maybe be confused by the fact, that there are three organizations that are constantly named in the articles.
You will hear about Los Zetas, the Knights Templar, which is the new brand for the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning, and the Sinaloa Federation.
You will read that Los Zetas is this assortment of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter and they silence the press, and this is somewhat true, or mostly true.
But this is the result of a very careful branding and business strategy.
You see, Los Zetas is not just this random assortment of individuals, but was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel, that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico.
When that corridor became contested, they decided that they wanted to recruit a professional enforcement arm.
So they recruited Los Zetas: an entire unit of elite paratroopers from the Mexican Army.
They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel, so much so that at some point, they decided to just take over the operations, which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets, because they grow up.
Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason, they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution in the most profitable markets like cocaine, but what they did have, and this is again based on their military origin, was a perfectly structured chain of command with a very clear hierarchy and a very clear promotion path that allowed them to supervise and operate across many, many markets very effectively, which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do.
And so because they didn't have access to the more profitable drug markets, this pushed them and gave them the opportunity to diversify into other forms of crime.
That includes kidnapping, prostitution, local drug dealing and human trafficking, including of migrants that go from the south to the U.S.
So what they currently run is truly and quite literally a franchise business.
They focus most of their recruiting on the army, and they very openly advertise for better salaries, better benefits, better promotion paths, not to mention much better food, than what the army can deliver.
The way they operate is that when they arrive in a locality, they let people know that they are there, and they go to the most powerful local gang and they say, "I offer you to be the local representative of the Zeta brand."
If they agree -- and you don't want to know what happens if they don't -- they train them and they supervise them on how to run the most efficient criminal operation for that town, in exchange for royalties.
This kind of business model obviously depends entirely on having a very effective brand of fear, and so Los Zetas carefully stage acts of violence that are spectacular in nature, especially when they arrive first in a city, but again, that's just a brand strategy.
I'm not saying they're not violent, but what I am saying is that even though you will read that they are the most violent of all, when you count, when you do the body count, they're actually all the same.
In contrast to them, the Knights Templar that arose in Michoacán emerged in reaction to the incursion of the Zetas into the state of Michoacán.
Michoacán is a geographically strategic state because it has one of the largest ports in Mexico, and it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico, which then gives you direct access to the U.S.
The Knights Templar realized very quickly that they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone, and so they developed a strategy as a social enterprise.
They brand themselves as representative of and protecting of the citizens of Michoacán against organized crime.
Their brand of social enterprise means that they require a lot of civic engagement, so they invest heavily in providing local services, like dealing with home violence, going after petty criminals, treating addicts, and keeping drugs out of the local markets where they are, and, of course, protecting people from other criminal organizations.
Now, they kill a lot of people too, but when they kill them, they provide very careful narratives and descriptions for why they did them, through newspaper insertions, YouTube videos, and billboards that explain that the people who were killed were killed because they represented a threat not to us, as an organization, of course, but to you, as citizens.
And so we're actually here to protect you.
They, as social enterprises do, have created a moral and ethical code that they advertise around, and they have very strict recruiting practices.
And here you have the types of explanations that they provide for some of their actions.
They have actually retained access to the profitable drug trade, but the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoacán, and they control the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas, they leverage that to, for example, trade copper from Michoacán that is legally created and legally extracted with illegal ephedrine from China which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines that they produce, and then they have partnerships with larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation that place their products in the U.S.
Finally, the Sinaloa Federation.
When you read about them, you will often read about them with an undertone of reverence and admiration, because they are the most integrated and the largest of all the Mexican organizations, and, many people argue, the world.
They started as just sort of a transport organization that specialized in smuggling between the U.S.
and the Mexican borders, but now they have grown into a truly integrated multinational that has partnerships in production in the south and partnerships in global distribution across the planet.
They have cultivated a brand of professionalism, business acumen and innovation.
They have designed new drug products and new drug processes.
They have designed narco-tunnels that go across the border, and you can see that these are not "The Shawshank Redemption" types.
They have invented narco-submarines and boats that are not detected by radar.
They have invented drones to transport drugs, catapults, you name it.
One of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation actually made it to the Forbes list.
[#701 Joaquin Guzman Loera] Like any multinational would, they have specialized and focused only in the most profitable part of the business, which is high-margin drugs like cocaine, heroine, methamphetamines.
Like any traditional Latin American multinational would, the way they control their operations is through family ties.
When they're entering a new market, they send or, if they're partnering with a new organization, they create a family tie, either through marriages or other types of ties.
Like any other multinational would, they protect their brand by outsourcing the more questionable parts of the business model, like for example, when they have to engage in violence against other criminal organizations, they recruit gangs and other smaller players to do the dirty work for them, and they try to separate their operations and their violence and be very discrete about this.
To further strengthen their brand, they actually have professional P.R. firms that shape how the press talks about them.
They have professional videographers on staff.
They have incredibly productive ties with the security organizations on both sides of the border.
And so, differences aside, what these three organizations share is on the one hand, a very clear understanding that institutions cannot be imposed from the top, but rather they are built from the bottom up one interaction at a time.
They have created extremely coherent structures that they use to show the inconsistencies in government policies.
And so what I want you to remember from this talk are three things.
is actually the result of a huge market demand and an institutional setup that forces the servicing of this market to necessitate violence to guarantee delivery routes.
The second thing I want you to remember is that these are sophisticated, coherent organizations and analyzing them and treating them as such is probably a much more useful approach.
The third thing I want you to remember is that even though we're more comfortable with this idea of "them," a set of bad guys separated from us, we are actually accomplices to them, either through our direct consumption or through our acceptance of the inconsistency between our policies of prohibition and our actual behavior of tolerance or even encouragement of consumption.
These organizations service, recruit from, and operate within our communities, so necessarily, they are much more integrated within them than we are comfortable acknowledging.
And so to me the question is not whether these dynamics will continue the way they have.
We see that the nature of this phenomenon guarantees that they will.
The question is whether we are willing to continue our support of a failed strategy based on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignorance at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young.
Thank you.

<title>Rodrigo Canales: The deadly genius of drug cartels</title>
<description>Up to 100,000 people died in drug-related violence in Mexico in the last 6 years. We might think this has nothing to do with us, but in fact we are all complicit, says Yale professor Rodrigo Canales in this unflinching talk that turns conventional wisdom about drug cartels on its head. The carnage is not about faceless, ignorant goons mindlessly killing each other but is rather the result of some seriously sophisticated brand management.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/chris_anderson_of_wired_on_tech_s_long_tail.html</url>
I'd like to speak about technology trends, which is something that many of you follow -- but we also follow, for related reasons.
Obviously, being a technology magazine, technology trends are something that we write about and need to know about.
But also it's part of being any monthly magazine -- you live in the future. And we have a long lead-time.
We have to plan issues many months in advance; we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months, nine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business.
We also, like a lot of companies, create a product that's based on technology trends.
In this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky, some entertainment. But the concept's quite the same.
And so we have to understand not only why tech's important, where it's going, but also, very importantly, when -- the timing is everything.
And it's interesting, when you look at the predictions made during the peak of the boom in the 1990s, about e-commerce, or Internet traffic, or broadband adoption, or Internet advertising, they were all right -- they were just wrong in time.
Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later.
But the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations is obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything.
You've probably seen something like this before.
This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve, which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan.
And just for fun, we put a bunch of technologies on it, to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak, or whether they were about to crash into the trough of disillusionment, or rise back in the slope of enlightenment, etc.
And this is one way to do technology forecasting: get a sense of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn.
We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important; we'll typically do it twice. Once, we want to do it first.
We want to be the first to do it, for the geeks who appreciate that, we'll catch it right there at the technology-trigger.
You can see in 1997, we put Linux on the cover.
But then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologies are going to hit the mainstream, and they're going to burst out.
And then it's time to do it again. Last year.
And that's one way that we try to time technology trends.
I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that I call my "grand unified theory of predicting the future," but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future.
It's based on the presumption, the observation even, that all important technologies go through four stages in their life -- at least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages.
And at each one of these stages, can be seen as a collision -- a collision with something else -- for example, a critical price-line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point.
And these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be, and maybe how you can do something about it.
The first is the critical price.
The first stage in a technology's advance is that it'll fall below a critical price.
After it falls below a critical price, it will tend, if it's successful, to rise above a critical mass, a penetration.
Many technologies, at that point, displace another technology, and that's another important point.
And then finally, a lot of technologies commoditize.
Towards the end of their life, they become nearly free.
Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it; it's an opportunity for the technology to change.
And even if you missed, you know, the first boom of Wi-Fi -- you know, Wi-Fi did the critical price, it did the critical mass, but hasn't done displacement yet, and hasn't done free yet -- there's still more opportunity in that.
I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this by telling the story of the DVD, which is a technology which has done all of these.
The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998, it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold.
And it started to take off. And you can see that the units started to trend up, the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off.
The next thing it hit, a year later, was critical mass. In this case, 20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household.
And what's interesting here is that something else took off along with it: home-theater units.
Suddenly you have a DVD in the house; you've got high-quality digital video; you have a reason to have a big-screen television; you have a reason for Dolby 5.1 surround-sound.
And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them, and bring the rest of your entertainment in.
What's interesting also is -- note that Netflix was founded in 1999.
Reed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment, that was an inflection point that he could do something with.
The next phase it hit was displacement.
You can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR.
And here too, you can see the implications in the world at large.
Netflix was right -- the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD in a way that the video-rental stores couldn't.
Among the DVD's many assets is that it's very small; you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply.
That gave an advantage; that was an implication of the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody.
And then finally, DVDs are approaching free.
There's a company called Apex, a no-name Chinese firm, who has, several times in the past year, been the number-one DVD seller in America. Their average price, for last year, was 48 dollars.
You're aware of the perhaps apocryphal Wal-Mart stampede over the 30-dollar DVD.
But they're getting very, very cheap, and look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper, the premium brands, the Sonys and such, are losing market share, and the no-names, the Apexes, are gaining them.
They're being commodified, and that's what happens when things go to zero. It's a tough market out there.
Now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology, these four stages of technology's life.
I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there, just technologies on our radar -- and I'll use this lens, these four, as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development.
They're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there -- they're just examples of technologies that are in each one of these periods.
But I think that the implications of them approaching these crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about.
Start with gene sequencing.
As you probably know, gene sequencing -- in a large part, because it's built on computers -- is falling in price at a kind of a Moore's Law-like level.
It is now possible -- will be possible, and if Craig Venter indeed comes today, he may tell you something about this -- to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year.
That's as opposed to billions just a few years ago.
You know, our ability to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer.
What's interesting is that at the same time, the number of genes that we're discovering is rising very quickly.
Each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test.
There will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply, if you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic.
Here's another technology that's approaching a critical price.
This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails.
In January 2000, the price was 10,000 dollars, or 27 dollars a day.
The generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere, and the effect was just dramatic on pricing.
Today it's less than 50 cents a day.
And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity, if you look at the correlation between these two, as the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treat goes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 -- two million in sub-Saharan Africa.
And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that.
Linux is another good example.
Now we've switched to critical mass.
These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass.
If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent.
Interestingly, it's done a crossover before, but not the crossovers that matter.
The crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue.
But you can look and see the direction those lines are going, you can see that at the 20 percent, it's now taken seriously.
It's not just for the geeks any more.
That is, I imagine, what people in Redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about.
Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars.
I don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic.
And if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 -- and I don't think this is a crazy forecast -- they'll be two percent of auto sales.
Two percent isn't 20 percent, but in the car business, which is slow moving, that's huge; that's arrival.
At two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere.
And what's interesting about the hybrids taking off is you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry.
It's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years.
And once you have electric motors, you can do anything: you can change the structure of the car in any way you want.
You can have regenerative braking; you can have drive-by-wire; you can have replaceable body shapes -- it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid, but it can lead to a whole new era of the car.
Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about.
Again, it's kind of coming out of nowhere; it's a little hard to use right now.
There's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype.
Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year; they already have nearly four million registered users -- that's critical mass.
And the same thing's happening on the carrier side.
You're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional telecom standards. This is a tipping point -- if Malcolm's here, forgive me -- and it's going to change the economics, and the speed, and the players in the industry.
It's going to look a little bit like that.
And finally, free. Free is really, really interesting.
Free is something that comes with digital, because the reproduction costs are essentially free. It comes with IP, because it's such an efficient protocol. It comes with fiber optics, because there's so much bandwidth.
Free is really, you know, the gift of Silicon Valley to the world.
It's an economic force; it's a technical force.
It's a deflationary force, if not handled right.
It is abundance, as opposed to scarcity.
Free is probably the most interesting thing.
And here you have just the number of songs that can be stored on a hard drive.
You know, there could be a film's [unclear] there, but it's basically, every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element, the physical element, of songs off the table.
And you've seen the numbers.
I mean, you know, the music industry is imploding in front of our very eyes, and Hollywood's worried as well.
They're facing a force that they haven't faced before.
And their response is draconian, and not necessarily the one that's going to get them out of this.
And finally, I'll give you one last example of free -- perhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics -- their abundance tends to make things free.
This is the price of a phone call to India per minute.
And what's interesting is that it was just 1990 when it was more than two dollars a minute.
India had, still has, a regulated phone system and so did we.
It was surprisingly non-innovative, moved very slowly, but then there was just so much fiber out there, you couldn't hold back, and look how quickly the price fell.
It's seven cents a minute, in many cases.
And the consequence of cheap phone calling, free phone calling, to India, is the pissed-off programmer, is the outsourcing.
It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization and one of the most powerful economic tools that we're seeing in our world today.
The force of India, and then China, and any other country that can contact our markets and will work with our companies -- because the communications are free -- is just beginning to be felt.
And I think that's probably one of the most important technology trends that we're looking at today.
Thank you.

<title>Chris Anderson : Technology's long tail</title>
<description>Chris Anderson, the editor of &lt;em&gt;WIRED&lt;/em&gt;, explores the four key stages of any viable technology: setting the right price, gaining market share, displacing an established technology and, finally, becoming ubiquitous.</description>

Clearly, we're living in a moment of crisis.
Arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us, and yet I stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive.
Because of some of technologies we've been talking about.
Because of the resources, the skills, and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world, with the mindset to create change.
And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen, who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower, but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.
And by definition, every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul, a global citizen.
You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another.
And no matter what country you live or work in, you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of, even in their most ordinariness.
Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty, how best we release their energies.
On the one hand, we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.
And on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid.
And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.
We call it patient capital.
The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent in Africa since 1970 and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption?
They use Mobutu as metaphor.
And their policy prescription is to make government more accountable, focus on the capital markets, invest, don't give anything away.
On the other side, as I said, there are those who say the problem is that we need more money.
That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out and we'll hand a lot of aid, but when it comes to our poor brethren, we want little to do with it.
They point to the successes of aid: the eradication of smallpox, and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.
Both sides are right.
And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.
Even more problematic, they're not listening to poor people themselves.
After 25 years of working on issues of poverty and innovation, it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented individuals on the planet than low-income people.
They must navigate markets daily, making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens, to move their way through society, and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family, they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.
And so we need both the market and we need aid.
Patient capital works between, and tries to take the best of both.
It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy, thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity, but as individual customers, consumers, clients, people who want to make decisions in their own lives.
Patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk, a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment, to use the market as the best listening device that we have, and the expectation of below-market returns, but outsized social impact.
It recognizes that the market has its limitation, and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people.
Now, entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons.
First, they tend to work in markets where people make one, two, three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level.
Second, the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure -- no roads to speak of, sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption.
Third, they are often creating markets.
Even if you're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages, it is something new.
And so many low-income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time, takes a lot of patience.
It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.
Not only to build the systems, the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way, but to connect those business to other markets, to governments, to corporations -- real partnerships if we want to get to scale.
I want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation.
In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur named Amitabha Sadangi from India, who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.
And he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether, despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in India make under a dollar a day.
They were creating subsidies either for large farms, or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use, rather than that the farmers wanted to use.
At the same time Amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in Israel.
It was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant.
And it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers, because these systems were both too expensive, and they were constructed for fields that were too large.
The average small village farmer works on two acres or less.
And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves, because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have.
And he used three fundamental principles.
The first one was miniaturization.
The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre, even if he had two, because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.
Second, it had to be extremely affordable.
In other words, that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest, or else they wouldn't take the risk.
And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls infinitely expandable.
What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre, the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth.
As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization, has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average, but this didn't happen overnight.
In fact, when you go back to the beginning, there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day, that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.
And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants to research, to experiment, to fail, to innovate and try again.
And when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers, that's when patient capital could come in.
And we helped him build a company, for profit, that would build on IDE's knowledge, and start looking at sales and exports, and be able to tap into other kinds of capital.
Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.
And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.
And while, again, you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in India into Pakistan, just to get the permits, over time we were able to start a company with Dr. Sono, who runs a large community development organization in the Thar Desert, which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.
And though that company has just started, our assumption is that there too we'll see the impact on millions.
But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation.
We're starting to see these happening all around the world.
In Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing has worked in partnership with us, with UNICEF, with the Global Fund, to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women.
And they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets for Africans around the world.
Lifespring Hospital is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India to bring quality, affordable maternal health care to low-income women, and it's been so successful that it's currently building a new hospital every 35 days.
And 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to reinvent a completely broken industry, building an ambulance service in Bombay that would use the technology of Google Earth, a sliding scale pricing system so that all people could have access, and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form of corruption.
So that in the terrorist attacks of November they were the first responder, and are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.
They've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances, and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in India.
This idea of scale is critical.
Because we're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed have reached at least a quarter million people.
But that's obviously not enough.
And it's where the idea of partnership becomes so important.
Whether it's by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets, government itself, or partner with major corporations, there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.
President Obama understands that.
He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund to focus on what works in this country, and look at how we can scale it.
And I would submit that it's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations, not only for their country, but ones that we can use in the developed world as well.
Invest financial assistance, but also management assistance.
And then measure the returns, both from a financial perspective and from a social impact perspective.
When we think about new approaches to aid, it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan.
We've had a rocky relationship with that country and, in all fairness, the United States has not always been a very reliable partner.
But again I would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen.
And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund, we could use this time to invest not directly in government, though we would have government's blessing, nor in international experts, but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country.
People like Rashani Zafar, who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country, and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.
And Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way called incremental housing, where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers into safe, affordable community housing.
Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation that are building schools across the country.
It's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the Taliban.
I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now, and those of you who've also worked there can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population, and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.
President Kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.
I would say that the converse is true.
That these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day, provide real pathways to hope.
And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan, while we need to strengthen the judiciary, build greater stability, we also need to think about lifting those leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world.
On one of my last visits to Pakistan, I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.
And we left Karachi one morning before dawn.
It was about 115 degrees.
And we drove for eight hours along this moonscape-like landscape with very little color, lots of heat, very little discussion, because we were exhausted.
And finally, at the end of the journey, I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.
And as we got closer, its significance became apparent.
That there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall.
Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life.
His name was Raja, and he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father.
And he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he hadn't taken his 12 children and 50 grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about 50 cents a day.
Because he was building these crops.
And with the money he earned he could stay this year.
And for the first time ever in three generations, his children would go to school.
We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.
And he said, "Of course I will.
Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore."
When we think about solutions to poverty, we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity.
Because at the end of the day, dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.
And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity.
Because that is where dignity really starts.
Martin Luther King said that love without power is anemic and sentimental, and that power without love is reckless and abusive.
Our generation has seen both approaches tried, and often fail.
But I think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power.
For that is what we'll need, as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us, and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.
The time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.
I can only talk from my own experience, but in eight years of running Acumen fund, I've seen the power of patient capital.
Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking, but to truly build systems that have created more than 25,000 jobs and delivered tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on the planet.
I know it works.
But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.
And so I urge you, in whatever sector you work, in whatever job you do, to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start from the perspective of those we're trying to help.
Rather than what we think that they might need.
It will take embracing the world with both arms.
And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability, with a sense of integrity and perseverance.
And yet these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generations.
And there is so much good that we can do.
Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert.
Thank you.

<title>Jacqueline Novogratz: A third way to think about aid</title>
<description>The debate over foreign aid often pits those who mistrust "charity" against those who mistrust reliance on the markets. Jacqueline Novogratz proposes a middle way she calls patient capital, with promising examples of entrepreneurial innovation driving social change.</description>

Over the past couple of days as I've been preparing for my speech, I've become more and more nervous about what I'm going to say and about being on the same stage as all these fascinating people.
Being on the same stage as Al Gore, who was the first person I ever voted for.
And -- So I was getting pretty nervous and, you know, I didn't know that Chris sits on the stage, and that's more nerve wracking.
But then I started thinking about my family.
I started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great-grandfather, and I realized that I had all of these Teds going through my blood stream -- -- that I had to consider this "my element."
So, who am I?
Chris kind of mentioned I started a company with my husband.
We have about 125 people internationally.
If you looked in the book, you saw this, which I really was appalled by.
And because I wanted to impress you all with slides, since I saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs, I made a graph that moves, and I talk about the makeup of me.
So, besides this freakish thing, this is my science slide. This is math, and this is science; this is genetics.
This is my grandmother, and this is where I get this mouth.
I'm a blogger, which, probably to a lot of you, means different things.
You may have heard about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha, where a blogger talked about how you hack, or break into, a Kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen, and it spread all over. Kryptonite had to adjust the lock, and they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns.
You may have heard about Rathergate, which was basically the result of bloggers realizing that the "th" in 111 is not typesetted on an old typewriter; it's on Word.
Bloggers exposed this, or they worked hard to expose this.
You know, blogs are scary. This is what you see.
I see this, and I'm sure scared -- and I swear on stage -- shitless about blogs, because this is not something that's friendly.
But there are blogs that are changing the way we read news and consume media, and, you know, these are great examples. These people are reaching thousands, if not millions, of readers, and that's incredibly important.
During the hurricane, you had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog, updating it frequently. This was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools.
You have my friend, who has a blog on digital -- on PDRs, personal recorders.
He makes enough money, just by running ads, to support his family up in Oregon.
That's all he does now, and this is something that blogs have made possible.
And then you have something like this, which is Interplast.
It's a wonderful organization of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it.
Children with cleft palates will get it, and they document their story. This is wonderful.
I am not that caring.
I talk about myself. That's what I am. I'm a blogger.
I have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing, and I am an expert on this person, and so I write about it.
And -- the short story about my blog: it started in 2001. I was 23.
I wasn't happy with my job, because I was a designer, but I wasn't being really stimulated.
I was an English major in college. I didn't have any use for it, but I missed writing. So, I started to write a blog and I started to create things like these little stories.
This was an illustration about my camp experience when I was 11 years old, and how I went to a YMCA camp -- Christian camp -- and basically by the end, I had made my friends hate me so much that I hid in a bunk. They couldn't find me.
They sent a search party, and I overheard people saying they wish I had killed myself, jumped off Bible Peak.
You can laugh, this is OK.
This is me.
This is what happened to me.
And when I started my blog it was really this one goal -- I said, I am not going to be famous to the world, but I could be famous to people on the Internet.
And I set a goal. I said, "I'm going to win an award," because I had never won an award in my entire life.
And I said, "I'm going to win this award -- the South by Southwest Weblog award."
And I won it. I reached all of these people, and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life everyday.
And then I wrote a post about a banjo.
I wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo -- a $300 banjo, which is a lot of money, and I don't play instruments; I don't know anything about music.
I like music, and I like banjos, and I think I probably heard Steve Martin playing, and I said, "I could do that."
And I said to my husband, I said, "Ben, can I buy a banjo?" And he's like, "No."
And my husband -- this is my husband, who is very hot -- he won an award for being hot -- -- he told me, "You cannot buy a banjo.
You're just like your dad," who "collects" instruments.
And I wrote a post about how I was so mad at him; he was such a tyrant because he would not let me buy this banjo.
And those people who know me understood my joke.
This is Mena, this is how I make a joke at people.
Because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant: this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog.
And if he knew I was showing this right now -- I put this in today -- he would kill me.
But the thing was, I wrote this, and my friends read it, and they're like, "Oh, that Mena, she wrote a post about, you know, wanting a stupid thing and being stupid."
But I got emails from people that said, "Oh my God, your husband is such an asshole.
How much money does he spend on beer in a year?
You could take that money and buy your banjo.
Why don't you open a separate account?"
I've been with him since I was 17 years old. We've never had a separate bank account.
They said, "Separate your bank account -- spend your money; spend his money. That's it."
And then I got people saying, "Leave him."
And -- I was like, "OK, what, who are these people?
And why are they reading this?"
And I realized: I don't want to reach these people.
I don't want to write for this public audience.
And I started to kill my blog slowly.
I'm like, I don't want to write this anymore, and I slowly and slowly -- And I did tell personal stories from time to then.
I wrote this one, and I put this up because of Einstein today.
And I'm going to get choked up, because this is my first pet, and she passed away two years ago.
And I decided to break from, "I don't really write about my public life," because I wanted to give her a little memorial.
But anyways.
It's these sort of personal stories. You know, you read the blogs about politics, or about media, and gossip and all these things.
These are out there, but it's more of the personal that interests me, and this is -- this is who I am.
You see Norman Rockwell. And you have art critics say, "Norman Rockwell is not art.
Norman Rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms, and this is not something to be considered high art."
And I think this is one of the most important things to us as humans.
These things resonate with us, and, if you think about blogs, you think of high art blogs, the history paintings about, you know, all biblical stories, and then you have this.
These are the blogs that interest me: the people who just tell stories.
One story is about this baby, and his name is Odin.
His father was a blogger.
And he was writing his blog one day, and his wife gave birth to her baby at 25 weeks.
And he never expected this.
One day it was normal; the next day it was hell.
And this is a one-pound baby.
So Odin was documented every single day.
Pictures were taken every day: day one, day two ...
You have day nine -- they're talking about his apnea; day 39 -- he gets pneumonia.
His baby is so small, and I've never encountered such a just -- a disturbing image, but just -- just so heartfelt.
You're reading this as this happens, so on day 55, everybody reads that he's having failures: breathing failures and heart failures, and it's slowing down, and you don't know what to expect.
But then it gets better. Day 96 he goes home.
And you see this post.
That's not something that you're going to see in a paper or a magazine but this is something that this person feels, and people are excited about it.
Twenty-eight comments. That's not a huge amount of people reading, but 28 people matter.
And today he is a healthy baby, who, if you read his blog -- it's Snowdeal.org, his father's blog -- he is taking pictures of him still, because he is still his son and he is, I think, at his age level right now because he had received such great treatment from the hospital.
So, blogs.
So what? You've probably heard these things before.
We talked about the WELL, and we talked about all these sort of things throughout our online history.
But I think blogs are basically just an evolution, and that's where we are today.
It's this record of who you are, your persona.
You have your Google search where you say, "Hey, what is Mena Trott?"
And then you find these things and you're happy or unhappy.
But then you also find people's blogs, and those are the records of people who are writing daily -- not necessarily about the same topic, but things that interest them.
And we talk about the world flattens as being this panel, and I am very optimistic.
Whenever I think about blogs I'm like, "Oh, we've got to reach all these people."
Millions and hundreds of millions and billions of people.
You know, we're getting into China, we want to be there, but you know, there are so many people who won't have the access to write a blog.
But to see something like the $100 computer is amazing, because it's a -- blogging software is simple.
We have a successful company because of timing, and because of perseverance, but it's simple stuff -- it's not rocket science.
And so, that's an amazing thing to consider.
So, the life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important.
We started with a slide of my Teds, and I had to add this slide, because I knew that the minute I showed this, my mom -- my mom will see this deck somehow, because she does read my blog -- and she'll say, "Why wasn't there a picture of me?"
This is my mom. So, I have all of the people that I know of.
But this is basically the extent of the family that I know in terms of my direct line.
I showed a Norman Rockwell painting before, and this one I grew up with, looking at constantly.
I would spend hours looking at just the connections, saying, "Oh, the little kid up at the top has red hair; so does that first generation up there."
And just these little things.
This is not science, but this was enough for me to be really so interested in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line.
So, that has always influenced me.
I have this record, this 1910 census of another Grabowski -- that's my maiden name -- and there's a Theodore, because there's always a Theodore.
This is all I have. I have a couple of facts about somebody.
I have their date of birth, and their age, and what they did in their household, if they spoke English, and that's it. That's all I know of these people.
And it's pretty sad, because I only go back five generations, and then it's it. I don't even know what happens on my mom's side, because she's from Cuba and I don't have that many things.
And just doing this I spent time in the archives -- that's another thing why my husband's a saint -- I spent time in the Washington archives, just sitting there, looking for these things. Now it's online, but he sat through that.
And so you have this record and, you know, this is my great-great-grandmother.
This is the only picture I have. And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs; to think about the people who are on those $100 computers talking about who they are, sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing.
Another photo that has greatly influenced me, or a series of photos, is this project that's done by an Argentinean man and his wife.
And he's basically taking a picture of his family everyday for the past, what is '76 -- 20, oh my God, I'm '77 -- 29 years? Twenty-nine years.
There was a joke, originally, about my graph that I left out, which is: you see all this math? I'm just happy I was able to add it up to 100, because that's my skill set.
So you have these people aging, and now this is them today, or last year, and that's a powerful thing to have, to be able to track this.
I wish that I would have this of my family.
I know that one day my children will be wondering -- or my grandchildren, or my great-grandchildren, if I ever have children -- what I am going to -- who I was, so I do something that's very narcissistic: I am a blogger -- that is an amazing thing for me, because it captures a moment in time everyday.
I take a picture of myself -- I've been doing this since last year -- every single day.
And, you know, it's the same picture; it's basically the same person.
Only a couple of people read it. I don't write this for this audience; I'm showing it now, but I would go insane if this was really public.
About four people probably read it, and they tell me, you know, "You haven't updated" -- I'm probably going to get people telling me I haven't updated -- but this is something that's amazing, because I can go back to a day -- I can go back to April 2005, and say, what was I doing this day? I look at it, I know exactly.
It's this visual cue that is so important to what we do.
I put the bad pictures up too, because there are bad pictures.
And I remember instantly: I am in Germany in this -- I had to go for a one-day trip.
I was sick, and I was in a hotel room, and I wanted not to be there. And so you see these things.
It's not just always smiling. Now I've kind of evolved it, so I have this look.
If you look at my driver's license I have the same look, and it's -- it's -- a pretty disturbing thing but it's something that is really important.
And the last story I really want to tell is this story, because this is probably the one that means the most to me in all of what I'm doing.
And I'll probably get choked up, because I tend to when I talk about this.
So, this woman, her name was Emma, and she was a blogger on our service, TypePad. And she was a beta tester, so she was there right when we opened -- you know, there were 100 people -- and she wrote about her life dealing with cancer.
She was writing and writing and writing, and we all started reading it, because we had so few blogs on the service, we could keep track of everyone.
And she was writing one day, and, you know, then she disappeared for a little bit.
And her sister came on, and she said that Emma had passed away. And all of our support staff who had talked to her were really emotional, and it was a very hard day at the company.
And this was one of those instances where I realized how much blogging affects our relationship, and flattening this sort of world.
That this woman is in England, and she lives -- she lived a life where she was talking about what she was doing.
But the big thing that really influenced us was, her sister wrote to me, and she said, you know, and she wrote on this blog, that -- writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing that had happened to her, and being able to talk to people, being able to share what was going on, and being able to write and receive comments.
And that was amazing -- to be able to know that we had empowered that, and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing, and that the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary, that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs, that we can be people who are open, and wanting to help and talk to people.
That was an amazing thing.
And -- and so I printed out her -- or I sent a PDF of her blog to her family, and they passed it out at her memorial service, and even in her obituary, they mentioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life.
And that's a huge thing.
So, this is her legacy, and I think that my call to action to all of you is: you know, think about blogs, think about what they are, think about what you've thought of them, and then actually do it, because it's something that is really going to change our lives.
So, thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/barbara_block_tagging_tuna_in_the_deep_ocean.html</url>
I've been fascinated for a lifetime by the beauty, form and function of giant bluefin tuna.
Bluefin are warmblooded like us.
They're the largest of the tunas, the second-largest fish in the sea -- bony fish.
They actually are a fish that is endothermic -- powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal.
That's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
You can see in its shape and its streamlined design it's powered for ocean swimming.
It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins, gets lift, powers its movements with a lunate tail.
It's actually got a naked skin for most of its body, so it reduces friction with the water.
This is what one of nature's finest machines.
Now, bluefin were revered by Man for all of human history.
For 4,000 years, we fished sustainably for this animal, and it's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago.
Bluefin are in cave paintings in France.
They're on coins that date back 3,000 years.
This fish was revered by humankind.
It was fished sustainably till all of time, except for our generation.
Bluefin are pursued wherever they go -- there is a gold rush on Earth, and this is a gold rush for bluefin.
There are traps that fish sustainably up until recently.
And yet, the type of fishing going on today, with pens, with enormous stakes, is really wiping bluefin ecologically off the planet.
Now bluefin, in general, goes to one place: Japan.
Some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin.
They're delectable muscle, rich in fat -- absolutely taste delicious.
And that's their problem; we're eating them to death.
Now in the Atlantic, the story is pretty simple.
Bluefin have two populations: one large, one small.
The North American population is fished at about 2,000 ton.
The European population and North African -- the Eastern bluefin tuna -- is fished at tremendous levels: 50,000 tons over the last decade almost every year.
The result is whether you're looking at the West or the Eastern bluefin population, there's been tremendous decline on both sides, as much as 90 percent if you go back with your baseline to 1950.
For that, bluefin have been given a status equivalent to tigers, to lions, to certain African elephants and to pandas.
These fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months.
They were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago, despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of CITES I.
And if it's tunas you don't care about, perhaps you might be interested that international long lines and pursing chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks, sharks, marlin, albatross.
These animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries.
The challenge we face is that we know very little about tuna, and everyone in the room knows what it looks like when an African lion takes down its prey.
I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed.
This tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room.
It's the 21st century, but we really have only just begun to really study our oceans in a deep way.
Technology has come of age that's allowing us to see the Earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely.
And we've got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works.
Most of us from the ship -- even I -- look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea.
We don't know where the structure is.
We can't tell where are the watering holes like we can on an African plain.
We can't see the corridors, and we can't see what it is that brings together a tuna, a leatherback and an albatross.
We're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot.
The reasons these challenges are great is that technically it's difficult to go to sea.
It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf, the entire Pacific realm.
It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it.
And then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU, getting up close to a blue whale and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays, an engineering challenge we've yet to really overcome.
So the story of our team, a dedicated team, is fish and chips.
We basically are taking the same satellite phone parts, or the same parts that are in your computer, chips.
We're putting them together in unusual ways, and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before.
And for the first time, we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset.
Now, I've been working with tunas for over 15 years.
I have the privilege of being a partner with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
We've actually taken a sliver of the ocean, put it behind glass, and we together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display.
When the veil of bubbles lifts every morning, we can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean, one of the only places on Earth you can see giant bluefin swim by.
We can see in their beauty of form and function, their ceaseless activity.
They're flying through their space, ocean space.
And we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty.
Behind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
Here, for over 14 or 15 years, we've actually brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity.
We'd been studying these fish, but first we had to learn how to husbandry them.
What do they like to eat?
What is it that they're happy with?
We go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin -- it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful.
And then, better yet, we've got our own version of tuna whisperers, our own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton, who can take a big tuna and in one motion, put it into an envelope of water, so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea.
Jeff and Jason there, are scientists who are going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill, a flume.
And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan, but it's staying in place.
We're actually measuring its oxygen consumption, its energy consumption.
We're taking this data and building better models.
And when I see that tuna -- this is my favorite view -- I begin to wonder: how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did?
So take a look at that animal.
That's the closest you'll probably ever get.
Now, the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean.
So in a program called Tag-A-Giant we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada, from Corsica to Spain.
We've fished with many nations around the world in an effort to basically put electronic computers inside giant tunas.
We've actually tagged 1,100 tunas.
And I'm going to show you three clips, because I tagged 1,100 tunas.
It's a very hard process, but it's a ballet.
We bring the tuna out, we measure it.
A team of fishers, captains, scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes.
We put water over its gills, give it oxygen.
And then with a lot of effort, after tagging, putting in the computer, making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment, we send this fish back into the sea.
And when it goes, we're always happy.
We see a flick of the tail.
And from our data that gets collected, when that tag comes back, because a fisher returns it for a thousand-dollar reward, we can get tracks beneath the sea for up to five years now, on a backboned animal.
Now sometimes the tunas are really large, such as this fish off Nantucket.
But that's about half the size of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged.
It takes a human effort, a team effort, to bring the fish in.
In this case, what we're going to do is put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna.
This tag rides on the tuna, senses the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish, detach, float to the surface and send back to Earth-orbiting satellites position data estimated by math on the tag, pressure data and temperature data.
And so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag.
Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive.
These tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in North America.
They are some of our finest instruments, our new technology in the ocean today.
One community in general has given more to help us than any other community.
And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina.
There are two villages, Harris and Morehead City, every winter for over a decade, held a party called Tag-A-Giant, and together, fishers worked with us to tag 800 to 900 fish.
In this case, we're actually going to measure the fish.
We're going to do something that in recent years we've started: take a mucus sample.
Watch how shiny the skin is; you can see my reflection there.
And from that mucus, we can get gene profiles, we can get information on gender, checking the pop-up tag one more time, and then it's out in the ocean.
And this is my favorite.
With the help of my former postdoc, Gareth Lawson, this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna.
This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean.
The warm is the Gulf Stream, the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine.
That's where the tuna wants to go -- it wants to forage on schools of herring -- but it can't get there. It's too cold.
But then it warms up, and the tuna pops in, gets some fish, maybe comes back to home base, goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina and then on to the Bahamas.
And my favorite scene, three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico.
Three tunas tagged.
Astronomically, we're calculating positions.
They're coming together. That could be tuna sex -- and there it is.
That is where the tuna spawn.
So from data like this, we're able now to put the map up, and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging.
And now we're showing that tunas on the western side go to the eastern side.
So two populations of tunas -- that is, we have a Gulf population, one that we can tag -- they go to the Gulf of Mexico, I showed you that -- and a second population.
Living amongst our tunas -- our North American tunas -- are European tunas that go back to the Med.
On the hot spots -- the hope spots -- they're mixed populations.
And so what we've done with the science is we're showing the International Commission, building new models, showing them that a two-stock no-mixing model -- to this day, used to reject the CITES treaty -- that model isn't the right model.
This model, a model of overlap, is the way to move forward.
So we can then predict where management places should be.
Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean are places where the single species, the single population, can be captured.
These become forthright in places we need to protect.
The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is, I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish, because they manage their fisheries well, they're doing a good job.
But in the international realm, where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild, these are the places that we have to make hope spots in.
That's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna.
Now in a second project called Tagging of Pacific Pelagics, we took on the planet as a team, those of us in the Census of Marine Life.
And, funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others, we were able to actually go in, in our project -- we're one of 17 field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators, not just tunas.
So what we've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska, met salmon shark on their home territory, followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that, if we take a salmon and put it on a line, we can actually take up a salmon shark -- This is the cousin of the white shark -- and very carefully -- note, I say "very carefully," -- we can actually keep it calm, put a hose in its mouth, keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag.
That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message.
And that shark leaping there, if you look carefully, has an antenna.
It's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon, sending home its data.
Salmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag.
But there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution on an ocean of temperature -- warm colors are warmer.
Salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into Monterey.
Now right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones are a white shark team led by Scott Anderson -- there -- and Sal Jorgensen.
They can throw out a target -- it's a carpet shaped like a seal -- and in will come a white shark, a curious critter that will come right up to our 16-ft. boat.
It's a several thousand-pound animal.
And we'll wind in the target.
And we'll place an acoustic tag that says, "OMSHARK 10165," or something like that, acoustically with a ping.
And then we'll put on a satellite tag that will give us the long-distance journeys with the light-based geolocation algorithms solved on the computer that's on the fish.
So in this case, Sal's looking at two tags there, and there they are: the white sharks of California going off to the white shark cafe and coming back.
We also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues, blue sharks.
And now, together, what we can see on this ocean of color that's temperature, we can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks.
We have white sharks and blue sharks.
For the first time, an ecoscape as large as ocean-scale, showing where the sharks go.
The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable: three teams tagged 1,700 tunas, bluefin, yellowfin and albacore all at the same time -- carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out, pick up juvenile tunas, put in the tags that actually have the sensors, stick out the tuna and then let them go.
They get returned, and when they get returned, here on a NASA numerical ocean you can see bluefin in blue go across their corridor, returning to the Western Pacific.
Our team from UCSC has tagged elephant seals with tags that are glued on their heads, that come off when they slough.
These elephant seals cover half an ocean, take data down to 1,800 feet -- amazing data.
And then there's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters wearing tuna tags, light-based tags, that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back, journeys of 35,000 nautical miles we had never seen before.
But now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small, we can actually see these journeys.
Same thing with Laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes, up to the same zone the tunas use.
You can see why they might be caught.
Then there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande tagging leatherbacks that go right past where we are.
And Scott Benson's team that showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia all the way to Monterey.
So what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are.
We can actually see how they're using ecospaces as large as an ocean.
And from this information, we can begin to map the hope spots.
So this is just three years of data right here -- and there's a decade of this data.
We see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on.
So what we're able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots, 4,000 deployments, a huge herculean task, 2,000 tags in an area, shown here for the first time, off the California coast, that appears to be a gathering place.
And then for sort of an encore from these animals, they're helping us.
They're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters.
They're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles.
Those are seals from many countries being released who are sampling underneath the ice sheets and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality on both poles.
This data, when visualized, is captivating to watch.
We still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data.
And then, as these animals swim and give us the information that's important to climate issues, we also think it's critical to get this information to the public, to engage the public with this kind of data.
We did this with the Great Turtle Race -- tagged turtles, brought in four million hits.
And now with Google's Oceans, we can actually put a white shark in that ocean.
And when we do and it swims, we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from California to Hawaii.
But maybe Mission Blue can fill in that ocean that we can't see.
We've got the capacity, NASA has the ocean.
We just need to put it together.
So in conclusion, we know where Yellowstone is for North America; it's off our coast.
We have the technology that's shown us where it is.
What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue is increasing the biologging capacity.
How is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere?
And then finally -- to basically get the message home -- maybe use live links from animals such as blue whales and white sharks.
Make killer apps, if you will.
A lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge.
Let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone.
That way we do away with a few internet myths.
So we can save the bluefin tuna.
We can save the white shark.
We have the science and technology.
Hope is here. Yes we can.
We need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans.
Thank you.

Hi there. I'm Hasan. I'm an artist.
And usually when I tell people I'm an artist, they just look at me and say, "Do you paint?"
or "What kind of medium do you work in?"
Well most of my work that I work with is really a little bit about methodologies of working rather than actually a specific discipline or a specific technique.
So what I'm really interested in is creative problem solving.
And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago.
So let me show you a little of that.
So it started over here.
And this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002.
I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas.
And as I was coming back, well I was taken by the FBI, met by an FBI agent, and went into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions -- "Where were you? What were you doing? Who were you talking with?
Why were you there? Who pays for your trips?" -- all these little details.
And then literally just out of nowhere, the guy asks me, "Where were you September 12th?"
And when most of us get asked, "Where were you September 12th?"
or any date for that fact, it's like, "I don't exactly remember, but I can look it up for you."
So I pulled out my little PDA, and I said, "Okay, let's look up my appointments for September 12th."
I had September 12th -- from 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., I paid my storage bill.
From 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time.
From 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., I taught my intro class, 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., I taught my advanced class.
"Where were you the 11th?" "Where were you the 10th?"
"Where were you the 29th? the 30th?"
"Where were you October 5th?"
We read about six months of my calendar.
And I don't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records of what I did.
But good thing I did, because I don't look good in orange.
So he asked me -- "So this storage unit that you paid the rent on, what did you have in it?"
This was in Tampa, Florida, so I was like, "Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida.
Furniture that I can't fit in my ratty apartment.
Just assorted garage sale junk, because I'm a pack rat."
And he looks at me really confused and says, "No explosives?"
I was like, "No, no. I'm pretty certain there were no explosives.
And if there were, I would have remembered that one."
And he's still a little confused, but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes realizes I'm not exactly a terrorist threat.
And so we're sitting there, and eventually after about an hour, hour and a half of just going back and forth, he says, "Okay, I have enough information here.
I'm going to pass this onto the Tampa office. They're the ones who initiated this.
They'll follow up with you, and we'll take care of it."
I was like, "Great."
So I got home and the phone rings, and a man introduced himself.
Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa where I spent six months of my life -- back and forth, not six months continuously.
By the way, you folks know that in the United States, you can't take photographs of federal buildings, but Google can do it for you.
So to the folks from Google, thank you.
So I spent a lot of time in this building.
Questions like: "Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act that may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation?"
And you also have to consider the state of mind you're in when you're doing this.
You're basically face-to-face with someone that essentially decides life or death.
Or questions such as -- actually, during the polygraph, which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them -- one of the polygraph questions was ...
well the first one was, "Is your name Hasan?" "Yes."
"Are we in Florida?" "Yes." "Is today Tuesday?" "Yes."
Because you have to base it on a yes or no.
Then, of course, the next question is: "Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"
I work at a university.
So I was like, "Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly."
But they said, "Okay, aside from what we had discussed, do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"
So at the end of six months of this and nine consecutive polygraphs, they said, "Hey, everything's fine."
I was like, "I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys all along.
I know everything's fine."
So they're looking at me really odd.
And it's like, "Guys, I travel a lot."
This is with the FBI.
And I was like, "All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo, and here we go all over again."
And there was a sincere concern there.
And he was like, "You know, if you get into trouble, give us a call -- we'll take care of it."
So ever since then, before I would go anywhere, I would call the FBI.
I would tell them, "Hey guys, this is where I'm going. This is my flight.
Northwest flight seven coming into Seattle on March 12th" or whatever.
A couple weeks later, I'd call again, let them know.
It wasn't that I had to, but I chose to.
Just wanted to say, "Hey guys.
Don't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves."
"I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee.
Just letting you know. Heads up."
And so I just kept doing this over and over and over.
And then the phone calls turned into emails, and the emails got longer and longer and longer ...
with pictures, with travel tips.
Then I'd make websites.
And then I built this over here. Let me go back to it over here.
So I actually designed this back in 2003.
So this kind of tracks me at any given moment.
I wrote some code for my mobile phone.
Basically, what I decided is okay guys, you want to watch me, that's cool.
But I'll watch myself. It's okay.
You don't have to waste your energy or your resources.
And I'll help you out.
So in the process, I start thinking, well what else might they know about me?
Well they probably have all my flight records, so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online.
So you can see, Delta 1252 going from Kansas City to Atlanta.
And then you see, these are some of the meals that I've been fed on the planes.
This was on Delta 719 going from JFK to San Francisco.
See that? They won't let me on a plane with that, but they'll give it to me on the plane.
These are the airports that I hang out in, because I like airports.
That's Kennedy airport, May 19th, Tuesday.
This is in Warsaw.
Singapore. You can see, they're kind of empty.
These images are shot really anonymously to the point where it could be anyone.
But if you can cross-reference this with the other data, then you're basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent and putting it all together.
And when you're in a situation where you have to justify every moment of your existence, you're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner.
At the time that this was going on, the last thing on my mind was "art project."
I was certainly not thinking, hey, I got new work here.
But after going through this, after realizing, well what just happened?
And after piecing together this, this and this, this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this, and it actually became this project.
So these are the stores that I shop in -- some of them -- because they need to know.
This is me buying some duck flavored paste at the Ranch 99 in Daly City on Sunday, November 15th.
At Coreana Supermarket buying my kimchi because I like kimchi.
And I bought some crabs too right around there, and some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville.
And laundry too. Laundry detergent at West Oakland -- East Oakland, sorry.
And then my pickled jellyfish at the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route 18 in East Brunswick.
Now if you go to my bank records, it'll actually show something from there, so you know that, on May 9th, that I bought $14.79 in fuel from Safeway Vallejo.
So not only that I'm giving this information here and there, but now there's a third party, an independent third party, my bank, that's verifying that, yes indeed, I was there at this time.
So there's points, and these points are actually being cross-referenced.
And there's a verification taking place.
Sometimes they're really small purchases.
So 34 cents foreign transaction fee.
All of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts, and everything pops up right away.
Sometimes there's a lot of information.
This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was.
And then sometimes you get this.
Sometimes you just get this, just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City, January 22nd.
And I can tell you exactly who I was with, where I was, because this is what I had to do with the FBI.
I had to tell them every little detail of everything.
I spend a lot of time on the road.
This is a parking lot in Elko, Nevada off of Route 80 at 8:01 p.m. on August 19th.
I spend a lot of time in gas stations too -- empty train stations.
So there's multiple databases.
And there's thousands and thousands and thousands of images.
There's actually 46,000 images right now on my site, and the FBI has seen all of them -- at least I trust they've seen all of them.
And then sometimes you don't get much information at all, you just get this empty bed.
And sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information.
So you get something like this.
This, by the way, is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California -- Vietnamese sandwich.
So there's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations, empty gas stations.
These are some of the meals that I've been cooking at home.
So how do you know these are meals eaten at home?
Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times.
So again, you have to do some detective work here.
So sometimes the databases get so specific.
These are all tacos eaten in Mexico City near a train station on July fifth to July sixth.
At 11:39 a.m. was this one.
At 1:56 p.m. was this one. At 4:59 p.m. was this one.
So I time-stamp my life every few moments.
Every few moments I shoot the image.
Now it's all done on my iPhone, and it all goes straight up to my server, and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together.
They need to know where I'm doing my business, because they want to know about my business.
So on December 4th, I went here.
And on Sunday, June 14th at 2009 -- this was actually about two o'clock in the afternoon in Skowhegan, Maine -- this was my apartment there.
So what you're basically seeing here If you go to my site, there's tons of things.
And really, it's not the most user-friendly interface.
It's actually quite user-unfriendly.
And one of the reasons, also being part of the user-unfriendliness, is that everything is there, but you have to really work through it.
So by me putting all this information out there, what I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything.
But in this barrage of noise that I'm putting out, I actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life.
And you know very little about me actually.
And really so I've come to the conclusion that the way you protect your privacy, particularly in an era where everything is cataloged and everything is archived and everything is recorded, there's no need to delete information anymore.
So what do you do when everything is out there?
Well you have to take control over it.
And if I give you this information directly, it's a very different type of identity than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces.
The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies -- they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information, or restricted access to information.
And the reason their information has any value is, well, because no one else has access to it.
And by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you, the information that the FBI has has no value, so thus devaluing their currency.
And I understand that, on an individual level, it's purely symbolic.
But if 300 million people in the U.S.
started doing this, we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up.
Because it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything.
And we're getting to that.
When I first started this project, people were looking at me and saying, "Why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing, where you're at?
Why are you posting these photos?"
This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere and 750 million people were posting status messages or poking people.
So in a way, I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete.
I'm still doing this project, but it is obsolete, because you're all doing it.
This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis, whether we're aware of it or not.
So we're creating our own archives and so on.
And you know, some of my friends have always said, "Hey, you're just paranoid. Why are you doing this?
Because no one's really watching.
No one's really going to bother you."
So one of the things that I do is I actually look through my server logs very carefully.
Because it's about surveillance.
I'm watching who's watching me.
And I came up with these.
So these are some of my sample logs.
And just little bits and pieces, and you can see some of the things there.
And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see.
So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by -- Department of Homeland Security.
You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by.
I actually moved very close to them. I live right down the street from them now.
Central Intelligence Agency.
Executive Office of the President.
Not really sure why they show up, but they do.
I think they kind of like to look at art.
And I'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields.
Hasan, just curious.
You said, "Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone," but actually you do take the pictures and put on information.
So how many hours of the day does that take?
HE: Almost none.
It's no different than sending a text.
It's no different than checking an email.
It's one of those things, we got by just fine before we had to do any of those.
So it's just become another day.
I mean, when we update a status message, we don't really think about how long that's going to take.
So it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks, send, and then it's done.
And everything's automated at the other end.
On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage, the FBI gets crazy?
HE: Well it goes to the last point that I was at.
So it holds onto the very last point.
So if I'm on a 12-hour flight, you'll see the last airport that I departed from.
Hasan, thank you very much.

So if someone asked you for the three words that would sum up your reputation, what would you say?
How would people describe your judgment, your knowledge, your behaviors, in different situations?
Today I'd like to explore with you why the answer to this question will become profoundly important in an age where reputation will be your most valuable asset.
I'd like to start by introducing you to someone whose life has been changed by a marketplace fueled by reputation.
Sebastian Sandys has been a bed and breakfast host on Airbnb since 2008.
I caught up with him recently, where, over the course of several cups of tea, he told me how hosting guests from all over the world has enriched his life.
More than 50 people have come to stay in the 18th-century watchhouse he lives in with his cat, Squeak.
Now, I mention Squeak because Sebastian's first guest happened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen, and she promised that she would refrain from leaving a bad review on one condition: he got a cat.
And so Sebastian bought Squeak to protect his reputation.
Now, as many of you know, Airbnb is a peer-to-peer marketplace that matches people who have space to rent with people who are looking for a place to stay in over 192 countries.
The places being rented out are things that you might expect, like spare rooms and holiday homes, but part of the magic is the unique places that you can now access: treehouses, teepees, airplane hangars, igloos.
If you don't like the hotel, there's a castle down the road that you can rent for 5,000 dollars a night.
It's a fantastic example of how technology is creating a market for things that never had a marketplace before.
Now let me show you these heat maps of Paris to see how insanely fast it's growing.
This image here is from 2008.
The pink dots represent host properties.
Even four years ago, letting strangers stay in your home seemed like a crazy idea.
Now the same view in 2010.
And now, 2012.
There is an Airbnb host on almost every main street in Paris.
Now, what's happening here is people are realizing the power of technology to unlock the idling capacity and value of all kinds of assets, from skills to spaces to material possessions, in ways and on a scale never possible before.
It's an economy and culture called collaborative consumption, and, through it, people like Sebastian are becoming micro-entrepreneurs.
They're empowered to make money and save money from their existing assets.
But the real magic and the secret source behind collaborative consumption marketplaces like Airbnb isn't the inventory or the money.
It's using the power of technology to build trust between strangers.
This side of Airbnb really hit home to Sebastian last summer during the London riots.
He woke up around 9, and he checked his email and he saw a bunch of messages all asking him if he was okay.
Former guests from around the world had seen that the riots were happening just down the street, and wanted to check if he needed anything.
Sebastian actually said to me, he said, "Thirteen former guests contacted me before my own mother rang."
Now, this little anecdote gets to the heart of why I'm really passionate about collaborative consumption, and why, after I finished my book, I decided I'm going to try and spread this into a global movement.
Because at its core, it's about empowerment.
It's about empowering people to make meaningful connections, connections that are enabling us to rediscover a humanness that we've lost somewhere along the way, by engaging in marketplaces like Airbnb, like Kickstarter, like Etsy, that are built on personal relationships versus empty transactions.
Now the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us back to old market principles and collaborative behaviors that are hard-wired in all of us.
They're just being reinvented in ways that are relevant for the Facebook age.
We're literally beginning to realize that we have wired our world to share, swap, rent, barter or trade just about anything. We're sharing our cars on WhipCar, our bikes on Spinlister, our offices on Loosecubes, our gardens on Landshare. We're lending and borrowing money from strangers on Zopa and Lending Club.
We are trading lessons on everything from sushi-making to coding on Skillshare, and we're even sharing our pets on DogVacay.
Now welcome to the wonderful world of collaborative consumption that's enabling us to match wants with haves in more democratic ways.
Now, collaborative consumption is creating the start of a transformation in the way we think about supply and demand, but it's also a part of a massive value shift underway, where instead of consuming to keep up with the Joneses, people are consuming to get to know the Joneses.
But the key reason why it's taking off now so fast is because every new advancement of technology increases the efficiency and the social glue of trust to make sharing easier and easier.
Now, I've looked at thousands of these marketplaces, and trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients.
Let me give you an example.
Meet 46-year-old Chris Mok, who has, I bet, the best job title here of SuperRabbit.
Now, four years ago, Chris lost his job, unfortunately, as an art buyer at Macy's, and like so many people, he struggled to find a new one during the recession.
And then he happened to stumble across a post about TaskRabbit.
Now, the story behind TaskRabbit starts like so many great stories with a very cute dog by the name of Kobe.
Now what happened was, in February 2008, Leah and her husband were waiting for a cab to take them out for dinner, when Kobe came trotting up to them and he was salivating with saliva.
They realized they'd run out of dog food.
Kevin had to cancel the cab and trudge out in the snow.
Now, later that evening, the two self-confessed tech geeks starting talking about how cool it would be if some kind of eBay for errands existed.
Six months later, Leah quit her job, and TaskRabbit was born.
At the time, she didn't realize that she was actually hitting on a bigger idea she later called service networking.
It's essentially about how we use our online relationships to get things done in the real world.
Now the way TaskRabbit works is, people outsource the tasks that they want doing, name the price they're willing to pay, and then vetted Rabbits Yes, there's actually a four-stage, rigorous interview process that's designed to find the people that would make great personal assistants and weed out the dodgy Rabbits.
Now, there's over 4,000 Rabbits across the United States and 5,000 more on the waiting list.
Now the tasks being posted are things that you might expect, like help with household chores or doing some supermarket runs.
I actually learned the other day that 12 and a half thousand loads of laundry have been cleaned and folded through TaskRabbit.
But I love that the number one task posted, over a hundred times a day, is something that many of us have felt the pain of doing: yes, assembling Ikea furniture.
It's brilliant. Now, we may laugh, but Chris here is actually making up to 5,000 dollars a month running errands around his life.
And 70 percent of this new labor force were previously unemployed or underemployed.
I think TaskRabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption are like lemonade stands on steroids. They're just brilliant.
Now, when you think about it, it's amazing, right, that over the past 20 years, we've evolved from trusting people online to share information to trusting to handing over our credit card information, and now we're entering the third trust wave: connecting trustworthy strangers to create all kinds of people-powered marketplaces.
I actually came across this fascinating study by the Pew Center this week that revealed that an active Facebook user is three times as likely as a non-Internet user to believe that most people are trustworthy.
Virtual trust will transform the way we trust one another face to face.
Now, with all of my optimism, and I am an optimist, comes a healthy dose of caution, or rather, an urgent need to address some pressing, complex questions.
How to ensure our digital identities reflect our real world identities? Do we want them to be the same?
How do we mimic the way trust is built face-to-face online?
How do we stop people who've behaved badly in one community doing so under a different guise?
In a similar way that companies often use some kind of credit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan, or the rate of a mortgage, marketplaces that depend on transactions between relative strangers need some kind of device to let you know that Sebastian and Chris are good eggs, and that device is reputation.
Reputation is the measurement of how much a community trusts you.
Let's just take a look at Chris.
You can see that over 200 people have given him an average rating over 4.99 out of 5.
There are over 20 pages of reviews of his work describing him as super-friendly and fast, and he's reached level 25, the highest level, making him a SuperRabbit.
Now — -- I love that word, SuperRabbit.
And interestingly, what Chris has noted is that as his reputation has gone up, so has his chances of winning a bid and how much he can charge.
In other words, for SuperRabbits, reputation has a real world value.
Now, I know what you might be thinking.
Well, this isn't anything new. Just think of power sellers on eBay or star ratings on Amazon.
The difference today is that, with every trade we make, comment we leave, person we flag, badge we earn, we leave a reputation trail of how well we can and can't be trusted.
And it's not just the breadth but the volume of reputation data out there that is staggering.
Just consider this: Five million nights have been booked on Airbnb in the past six months alone.
30 million rides have been shared on Carpooling.com.
This year, two billion dollars worth of loans will go through peer-to-peer lending platforms.
This adds up to millions of pieces of reputation data on how well we behave or misbehave.
Now, capturing and correlating the trails of information that we leave in different places is a massive challenge, but one we're being asked to figure out.
What the likes of Sebastian are starting to rightfully ask is, shouldn't they own their reputation data?
Shouldn't the reputation that he's personally invested on building on Airbnb mean that it should travel with him from one community to another?
What I mean by this is, say he started selling second-hand books on Amazon. Why should he have to start from scratch?
It's a bit like when I moved from New York to Sydney.
It was ridiculous. I couldn't get a mobile phone plan because my credit history didn't travel with me.
I was essentially a ghost in the system.
Now I'm not suggesting that the next stage of the reputation economy is about adding up multiple ratings into some kind of empty score.
People's lives are too complex, and who wants to do that?
I also want to be clear that this isn't about adding up tweets and likes and friends in a clout-like fashion.
Those guys are measuring influence, not behaviors that indicate our trustworthiness.
But the most important thing that we have to keep in mind is that reputation is largely contextual.
Just because Sebastian is a wonderful host does not mean that he can assemble Ikea furniture.
The big challenge is figuring out what data makes sense to pull, because the future's going to be driven by a smart aggregation of reputation, not a single algorithm.
It's only a matter of time before we'll be able to perform a Facebook- or Google-like search and see a complete picture of someone's behaviors in different contexts over time.
I envision a realtime stream of who has trusted you, when, where and why, your reliability on TaskRabbit, your cleanliness as a guest on Airbnb, the knowledge that you display on Quora or [unclear], they'll all live together in one place, and this will live in some kind of reputation dashboard that will paint a picture of your reputation capital.
Now this is a concept that I'm currently researching and writing my next book on, and currently define as the worth of your reputation, your intentions, capabilities and values across communities and marketplaces.
This isn't some far-off frontier.
There are actually a wave of startups like Connect.Me and Legit and TrustCloud that are figuring out how you can aggregate, monitor and use your online reputation.
Now, I realize that this concept may sound a little Big Brother to some of you, and yes, there are some enormous transparency and privacy issues to solve, but ultimately, if we can collect our personal reputation, we can actually control it more, and extract the immense value that will flow from it.
Also, more so than our credit history, we can actually shape our reputation.
Just think of Sebastian and how he bought the cat to influence his.
Now privacy issues aside, the other really interesting issue I'm looking at is how do we empower digital ghosts, people [who] for whatever reason, are not active online, but are some of the most trustworthy people in the world?
How do we take their contributions to their jobs, their communities and their families, and convert that value into reputation capital?
Ultimately, when we get it right, reputation capital could create a massive positive disruption in who has power, trust and influence.
A three-digit score, your traditional credit history, that only 30 percent of us actually know what it is, will no longer be the determining factor in how much things cost, what we can access, and, in many instances, limit what we can do in the world.
Indeed, reputation is a currency that I believe will become more powerful than our credit history in the 21st century.
Reputation will be the currency that says that you can trust me.
Now the interesting thing is, reputation is the socioeconomic lubricant that makes collaborative consumption work and scale, but the sources it will be generated from, and its applications, are far bigger than this space alone.
Let me give you one example from the world of recruiting, where reputation data will make the résumé seem like an archaic relic of the past.
Four years ago, tech bloggers and entrepreneurs Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood, decided to start something called Stack Overflow.
Now, Stack Overflow is basically a platform where experienced programmers can ask other good programmers highly detailed technical questions on things like tiny pixels and chrome extensions.
This site receives five and a half thousand questions a day, and 80 percent of these receive accurate answers.
Now users earn reputation in a whole range of ways, but it's basically by convincing their peers they know what they're talking about.
Now a few months after this site launched, the founders heard about something interesting, and it actually didn't surprise them.
What they heard was that users were putting their reputation scores on the top of their résumés, and that recruiters were searching the platform to find people with unique talents.
Now thousands of programmers today are finding better jobs this way, because Stack Overflow and the reputation dashboards provide a priceless window into how someone really behaves, and what their peers think of them.
But the bigger principle of what's happening behind Stack Overflow, I think, is incredibly exciting.
People are starting to realize that the reputation they generate in one place has value beyond the environments from which it was built.
You know, it's very interesting.
When you talk to super-users, whether that's SuperRabbits or super-people on Stack Overflow, or Uberhosts, they all talk about how having a high reputation unlocks a sense of their own power.
On Stack Overflow, it creates a level playing field, enabling the people with the real talent to rise to the top.
On Airbnb, the people often become more important than the spaces. On TaskRabbit, it gives people control of their economic activity.
Now at the end of my tea with Sebastian, he told me how, on a bad, rainy day, when he hasn't had a customer in his bookstore, he thinks of all the people around the world who've said something wonderful about him, and what that says about him as a person.
He's turning 50 this year, and he's convinced that the rich tapestry of reputation he's built on Airbnb will lead him to doing something interesting with the rest of his life.
You know, there are only a few windows in history where the opportunity exists to reinvent part of how our socioeconomic system works.
We're living through one of those moments.
I believe that we are at the start of a collaborative revolution that will be as significant as the Industrial Revolution.
In the 20th century, the invention of traditional credit transformed our consumer system, and in many ways controlled who had access to what.
In the 21st century, new trust networks, and the reputation capital they generate, will reinvent the way we think about wealth, markets, power and personal identity, in ways we can't yet even imagine.
Thank you very much.

You all know the truth of what I'm going to say.
I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the French Revolution.
What's changed is we now can look at the evidence, we can compare societies, more and less equal societies, and see what inequality does.
I'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links I'm going to be showing you exist.
But first, see what a miserable lot we are.
I want to start though with a paradox.
This shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average.
And you see the countries on the right, like Norway and the USA, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.
There's no suggestion of a relationship there.
But if we look within our societies, there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society.
This, again, is life expectancy.
These are small areas of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top.
So income means something very important within our societies, and nothing between them.
The explanation of that paradox is that, within our societies, we're looking at relative income or social position, social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us.
And as soon as you've got that idea, you should immediately wonder: what happens if we widen the differences, or compress them, make the income differences bigger or smaller?
And that's what I'm going to show you.
I'm not using any hypothetical data.
I'm taking data from the U.N. -- it's the same as the World Bank has -- on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies.
The measure we've used, because it's easy to understand and you can download it, is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country.
And you see in the more equal countries on the left -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- the top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the more unequal end -- U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore -- the differences are twice as big.
On that measure, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.
Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.
We collected data on problems with social gradients, the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, on kids' maths and literacy scores, on infant mortality rates, homicide rates, proportion of the population in prison, teenage birthrates, levels of trust, obesity, mental illness -- which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction -- and social mobility.
We put them all in one index.
They're all weighted equally.
Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things.
And there, you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you, which I shall use over and over again in the data.
The more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems.
It's an extraordinarily close correlation.
But if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, gross national income, there's nothing there, no correlation anymore.
We were a little bit worried that people might think we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence, so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well-being.
It has 40 different components put together by other people.
It contains whether kids can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, what immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school.
Everything goes into it.
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies.
Highly significant relationship.
But once again, if you look at that measure of child well-being, in relation to national income per person, there's no relationship, no suggestion of a relationship.
What all the data I've shown you so far says is the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth.
That's very important in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much.
I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index.
Here, for instance, is trust.
It's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted.
It comes from the World Values Survey.
You see, at the more unequal end, it's about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others.
But in the more equal societies, it rises to 60 or 65 percent.
And if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital, very similar relationships closely related to inequality.
I may say, we did all this work twice.
We did it first on these rich, developed countries, and then as a separate test bed, we repeated it all on the 50 American states -- asking just the same question: do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures?
So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality.
Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust.
Same thing is going on.
Basically we found that almost anything that's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the 50 states in that separate test bed.
We're not just talking about a fluke.
This is mental illness.
WHO put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society.
This is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year.
And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that -- whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others.
And again, closely related to inequality.
This is violence.
These red dots are American states, and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
But look at the scale of the differences.
It goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150.
This is the proportion of the population in prison.
There's a about a tenfold difference there, log scale up the side.
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison.
That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime.
In some places, that's part of it.
But most of it is about more punitive sentencing, harsher sentencing.
And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty.
Here we have children dropping out of high school.
Again, quite big differences.
Extraordinarily damaging, if you're talking about using the talents of the population.
This is social mobility.
It's actually a measure of mobility based on income.
Basically, it's asking: do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no relationship between the two?
And at the more unequal end, fathers' income is much more important -- in the U.K., USA.
And in Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less important.
There's more social mobility.
And as we like to say -- and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here -- if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
I've shown you just a few things in italics here.
I could have shown a number of other problems.
They're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries -- not just a little bit worse, but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.
Think of the expense, the human cost of that.
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points.
One is that, in graph after graph, we find the countries that do worse, whatever the outcome, seem to be the more unequal ones, and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality.
It's not just one or two things that go wrong, it's most things.
The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that, if you look at the bottom, Sweden and Japan, they're very different countries in all sorts of ways.
The position of women, how closely they keep to the nuclear family, are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world.
But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality.
Sweden has huge differences in earnings, and it narrows the gap through taxation, general welfare state, generous benefits and so on.
Japan is rather different though.
It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax.
It has lower taxes.
It has a smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states, we find rather the same contrast.
There are some states that do well through redistribution, some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax.
So we conclude that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality, as long as you get there somehow.
I am not talking about perfect equality, I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies.
Another really surprising part of this picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality.
There seems to be some truth in John Donne's "No man is an island."
And in a number of studies, it's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.
And so it's anachronistically a classification by fathers' occupations, so single parents go on their own.
But then where it says "low social class," that's unskilled manual occupations.
It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle, then the junior non-manual, going up high to the professional occupations -- doctors, lawyers, directors of larger companies.
You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society.
We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally.
And that seems to be the general picture -- that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom, but has some benefits even at the top.
But I should say a few words about what's going on.
I think I'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality.
More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, of being valued and devalued, respected and disrespected.
And of course, those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status insecurity.
We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others, whether we're regarded as attractive, clever, all that kind of thing.
The social-evaluative judgments increase, the fear of those social-evaluative judgments.
Interestingly, some parallel work going on in social psychology: some people reviewed 208 different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones, their responses to doing stressful tasks, measured.
And in the review, what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol, the central stress hormone.
And the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat -- threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance.
Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress.
Now we have been criticized.
Of course, there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising.
I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data, we never pick and choose data.
We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at, it goes into the analysis.
Our data source decides whether it's reliable data, we don't.
Otherwise that would introduce bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals.
This isn't confined to these countries here, hiding a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same measure of inequality, one problem after another.
Why don't we control for other factors?
Well we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't make any difference.
And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on.
What about causality?
Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality.
We spend a good bit of time.
And indeed, people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes.
The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or for instance, the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on.
I should say that to deal with this, we've got to deal with the post-tax things and the pre-tax things.
We've got to constrain income, the bonus culture incomes at the top.
I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can.
I think the take-home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us.
Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies, and that's exciting.
Thank you.

<title>Richard Wilkinson: How economic inequality harms societies</title>
<description>We feel instinctively that societies with huge income gaps are somehow going wrong. Richard Wilkinson charts the hard data on economic inequality, and shows what gets worse when rich and poor are too far apart: real effects on health, lifespan, even such basic values as trust.</description>

Nine years ago, I worked for the U.S. government in Iraq, helping rebuild the electricity infrastructure.
And I was there, and I worked in that job because I believe that technology can improve people's lives.
One afternoon, I had tea with a storekeeper at the Al Rasheed Hotel in Baghdad, and he said to me, "You Americans, you can put a man on the moon, but when I get home tonight, I won't be able to turn on my lights."
At the time, the U.S. government had spent more than two billion dollars on electricity reconstruction.
How do you ensure technology reaches users?
How do you put it in their hands so that it is useful?
So those are the questions that my colleagues and I at D-Rev ask ourselves.
And D-Rev is short for Design Revolution.
And I took over the organization four years ago and really focused it on developing products that actually reach users, and not just any users, but customers who live on less than four dollars a day.
One of the key areas we've been working on recently is medical devices, and while it may not be obvious that medical devices have something in common with Iraq's electricity grid then, there are some commonalities.
Despite the advanced technology, it's not reaching the people who need it most.
So I'm going to tell you about one of the projects we've been working on, the ReMotion Knee, and it's a prosthetic knee for above-knee amputees.
And this project started when the Jaipur Foot Organization, the largest fitter of prosthetic limbs in the world, came to the Bay Area and they said, "We need a better knee."
Chances are, if you're living on less than four dollars a day, and you're an amputee, you've lost your limb in a vehicle accident.
Most people think it's land mines, but it's a vehicle accident.
You're walking by the side of the road and you're hit by a truck, or you're trying to to jump on a moving train, you're late for work, and your pant leg gets caught.
And the reality is that if you don't have much money, like this young named Kamal right here, the option you really have And how big a problem is this?
There's over three million amputees every year who need a new or replacement knee.
And what are their options?
This is a high-end. This is what we'd call a "smart knee."
It's got a microprocessor inside.
It can pretty much do anything, but it's 20,000 dollars, and to give you a sense of who wears this, veterans, American veterans coming back from Afghanistan or Iraq would be fit with something like this.
This is a low-end titanium knee.
It's a polycentric knee, and all that that means is the mechanism, is a four-bar mechanism, that mimics a natural human knee.
But at 1,400 dollars, it's still too expensive for people like Kamal.
And lastly, here you see a low-end knee.
This is a knee that's been designed specifically for poor people.
And while you have affordability, you've lost on functionality.
The mechanism here is a single axis, and a single axis is like a door hinge.
So you can think about how unstable that would be.
And this is the type of mechanism that the Jaipur Foot Organization was using when they were looking for a better knee, and I just wanted to give you a sense of what a leg system looks like, because I'm showing you all these knees and I imagine it's hard to think how it all fits together.
So at the top you have a socket, and this fits over someone's residual limb, and everyone's residual limb is a little bit different.
And then you have the knee, and here I've got a single axis on the knee so you can see how it rotates, and then a pylon, and then a foot.
And we've been able to develop a knee, a polycentric knee, so that type of knee that acts like a human knee, mimics human gait, for 80 dollars retail.
But the key is, you can have this great invention, you can have this great design, but how do you get it to the people who most need it?
How do you ensure it gets to them and it improves their lives?
So at D-Rev, we've done some other projects, and we looked at three things that we really believe gets technologies to customers, to users, to people who need it.
And the first thing is that the product needs to be world class.
It needs to perform on par or better than the best products on the market.
Regardless of your income level, you want the most beautiful, the best product that there is.
I'm going to show you a video now of a man named Ash. You can see him walking.
He's wearing the same knee system here with a single axis knee.
And he's doing a 10-meter walk test.
And you'll notice that he's struggling with stability as he's walking.
And something that's not obvious, that you can't see, is that it's psychologically draining to walk and to be preventing yourself from falling.
Now this is a video of Kamal.
You remember Kamal earlier, holding the bamboo staff.
He's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee, and he's doing that same 10-meter walk test.
And you can see his stability is much better.
So world class isn't just about technical performance.
It's also about human performance.
And most medical devices, we've learned, as we've dug in, are really designed for Westerners, for wealthier economies.
But the reality is our users, our customers, they do different things. They sit cross-legged more.
We see that they squat. They kneel in prayer.
And we designed our knee to have the greatest range of motion of almost any other knee on the market.
So the second thing we learned, and this leads into my second point, which is that we believe that products need to be designed to be user-centric.
And at D-Rev, we go one step further and we say you need to be user-obsessed.
So it's not just the end user that you're thinking about, but everyone who interacts with the product, so, for example, the prosthetist who fits the knee, but also the context in which the knee is being fit.
What is the local market like?
How do all these components get to the clinic?
Do they all get there on time? The supply chain.
Everything that goes into ensuring that this product gets to the end user, and it goes in as part of the system, and it's used.
So I wanted to show you some of the iterations we did between the first version, the Jaipur Knee, so this is it right here.
Notice anything about it?
It clicks.
We'd seen that users had actually modified it.
So do you see that black strip right there?
That's a homemade noise dampener.
We also saw that our users had modified it in other ways.
You can see there that that particular amputee, he had wrapped bandages around the knee.
He'd made a cosmesis.
And if you look at the knee, it's got those pointy edges, right?
So if you're wearing it under pants or a skirt or a sari, it's really obvious that you're wearing a prosthetic limb, and in societies where there's social stigma around being disabled, people are particularly acute about this.
So I'm going to show you some of the modifications we did.
We did a lot of iterations, not just around this, but some other things.
But here we have the version three, the ReMotion Knee, but if you look in here, you can see the noise dampener. It's quieter.
The other thing we did is that we smoothed the profile.
We made it thinner.
And something that's not obvious is that we designed it for mass production.
And this goes into my last point.
We really, truly believe that if a product is going to reach users at the scale that it's needed, it needs to be market-driven, and market-driven means that products are sold.
They're not donated. They're not heavily subsidized.
Our product needs to be designed to offer value to the end user.
It also has to be designed to be very affordable.
But a product that is valued by a customer is used by a customer, and use is what creates impact.
And we believe that as designers, it holds us accountable to our customers.
And with centralized manufacturing, you can control the quality control, and you can hit that $80 price point with profit margins built in.
And now, those profit margins are critical, because if you want to scale, if you want to reach all the people in the world who possibly need a knee, it needs to be economically sustainable.
So I want to give you a sense of where we are at.
We have fit over 5,000 amputees, and one of the big indicators we're looking at, of course, is, does it improve lives?
Well, the standard is, is someone still wearing their knee six months later?
The industry average is about 65 percent.
Ours is 79 percent, and we're hoping to get that higher.
Right now, our knees are worn in 12 countries.
This is where we want to get, though, in the next three years.
We'll double the impact in 2015, and we'll double it each of the following years after that.
But then we hit a new challenge, and that's the number of skilled prosthetists who are able to fit knees.
So I want to end with a story of Prinima.
Prinima was 18 years old when she was in a car accident where she lost her leg, and she traveled 12 hours by train to come to the clinic to be fit with a knee, and while all of the amputees who wear our knees affect us as the designers, she's particularly meaningful to me as an engineer and as a woman, because she was in school, she had just started school to study engineering.
And she said, "Well, now that I can walk again, I can go back and complete my studies."
And to me she represents the next generation of engineers solving problems and ensuring meaningful technologies reach their users.
So thank you.

<title>Krista Donaldson: The $80 prosthetic knee that's changing lives</title>
<description>We've made incredible advances in technology in recent years, but too often it seems only certain fortunate people can benefit. Engineer Krista Donaldson introduces the ReMotion knee, a prosthetic device for above-knee amputees, many of whom earn less than $4 a day. The design contains best-in-class technology and yet is far cheaper than other prosthetics on the market.</description>

B.J. was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future.
He had a vision. When he got out, he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight, and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision.
He'd spent 10,000 dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars.
It was my first week in federal prison, and I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV.
In fact, it was teeming with smart, ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the CEOs who had wined and dined me six months earlier when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate.
Now, 95 percent of the guys that I was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside, but when they talked about what they did, they talked about it in a different jargon, but the business concepts that they talked about weren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton: promotional incentives, you never charge a first-time user, focus-grouping new product launches, territorial expansion.
But they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days.
For the most part, everyone was just trying to survive.
It's a lot harder than you might think.
Contrary to what most people think, people don't pay, taxpayers don't pay, for your life when you're in prison. You've got to pay for your own life.
You've got to pay for your soap, your deodorant, toothbrush, toothpaste, all of it.
And it's hard for a couple of reasons.
First, everything's marked up 30 to 50 percent from what you'd pay on the street, and second, you don't make a lot of money.
I unloaded trucks. That was my full-time job, unloading trucks at a food warehouse, for $5.25, not an hour, but per month.
So how do you survive?
Well, you learn to hustle, all kinds of hustles.
There's legal hustles.
You pay everything in stamps. Those are the currency.
You charge another inmate to clean his cell.
There's sort of illegal hustles, like you run a barbershop out of your cell.
There's pretty illegal hustles: You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell.
And there's very illegal hustles, which you smuggle in, you get smuggled in, drugs, pornography, cell phones, and just as in the outer world, there's a risk-reward tradeoff, so the riskier the enterprise, the more profitable it can potentially be.
You want a cigarette in prison? Three to five dollars.
You want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head? Three hundred bucks.
You want a dirty magazine?
Well, it can be as much as 1,000 dollars.
So as you can probably tell, one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity.
Whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse, sculpting people's hair with toenail clippers, or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs, prisoners learn how to make do with less, and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they've learned to the outside and start restaurants, barber shops, personal training businesses.
But there's no training, nothing to prepare them for that, no rehabilitation at all in prison, no one to help them write a business plan, figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises, no access to the Internet, even.
And then, when they come out, most states don't even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background.
So none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex-offenders re-offend within five years.
Look, I lied to the Feds. I lost a year of my life from it.
But when I came out, I vowed that I was going to do whatever I could to make sure that guys like the ones I was locked up with didn't have to waste any more of their life than they already had.
So I hope that you'll think about helping in some way.
The best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons, because if we don't, they're not going to learn any new skills that's going to help them, and they'll be right back.
All they'll learn on the inside is new hustles.
Thank you.

<title>Jeff Smith: Lessons in business ... from prison</title>
<description>Jeff Smith spent a year in prison. But what he discovered inside wasn't what he expected -- he saw in his fellow inmates boundless ingenuity and business savvy. He asks: Why don't we tap this entrepreneurial potential to help ex-prisoners contribute to society once they're back outside? </description>

The new me is beauty.
Yeah, people used to say, "Norman's OK, but if you followed what he said, everything would be usable but it would be ugly."
Well, I didn't have that in mind, so ...
This is neat.
Thank you for setting up my display.
I mean, it's just wonderful.
And I haven't the slightest idea of what it does or what it's good for, but I want it.
And that's my new life.
My new life is trying to understand what beauty is about, and "pretty," and "emotions."
The new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun.
And so this is a Philippe Starck juicer, produced by Alessi.
It's just neat; it's fun. It's so much fun I have it in my house -- but I have it in the entryway, I don't use it to make juice.
In fact, I bought the gold-plated special edition and it comes with a little slip of paper that says, "Don't use this juicer to make juice."
The acid will ruin the gold plating.
So actually, I took a carton of orange juice and I poured it in the glass to take this picture.
Beneath it is a wonderful knife.
It's a Global cutting knife made in Japan.
First of all, look at the shape -- it's just wonderful to look at.
Second of all, it's really beautifully balanced: it holds well, it feels well.
And third of all, it's so sharp, it just cuts.
It's a delight to use.
And so it's got everything, right?
It's beautiful and it's functional.
And I can tell you stories about it, which makes it reflective, and so you'll see I have a theory of emotion.
And those are the three components.
Hiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab took a ping-pong table and placed a projector above it, and on the ping-pong table they projected an image of water with fish swimming in it.
And as you play ping-pong, whenever the ball hits part of the table, the ripples spread out and the fish run away.
But of course, then the ball hits the other side, the ripples hit the -- poor fish, they can't find any peace and quiet.
Is that a good way to play ping-pong?
No. But is it fun?
Yeah! Yeah.
Or look at Google.
If you type in, oh say, "emotion and design," you get 10 pages of results.
So Google just took their logo and they spread it out.
Instead of saying, "You got 73,000 results.
This is one through 20. Next," they just give you as many o's as there are pages.
It's really simple and subtle.
I bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it.
That's the subconscious mind that sort of notices it -- it probably is kind of pleasant and you didn't know why.
And it's just clever.
And of course, what's especially good is, if you type "design and emotion," the first response out of those 10 pages is my website.
Now, the weird thing is Google lies, because if I type "design and emotion," it says, "You don't need the 'and.' We do it anyway."
So, OK.
So I type "design emotion" and my website wasn't first again.
It was third.
Oh well, different story.
There was this wonderful review in The New York Times about the MINI Cooper automobile.
It said, "You know, this is a car that has lots of faults.
Buy it anyway.
It's so much fun to drive."
And if you look at the inside of the car -- I mean, I loved it, I wanted to see it, I rented it, this is me taking a picture while my son is driving -- and the inside of the car, the whole design is fun.
It's round, it's neat.
The controls work wonderfully.
So that's my new life; it's all about fun.
I really have the feeling that pleasant things work better, and that never made any sense to me until I finally figured out -- look ...
I'm going to put a plank on the ground.
So, imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and 30 feet long and I'm going to walk on it, and you see I can walk on it without looking, I can go back and forth and I can jump up and down.
No problem.
Now I'm going to put the plank 300 feet in the air -- and I'm not going to go near it, thank you.
Intense fear paralyzes you.
It actually affects the way the brain works.
So, Paul Saffo, before his talk said that he didn't really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk, and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus.
That's what fear and anxiety does; it causes you to be -- what's called depth-first processing -- to focus, not be distracted.
And I couldn't force myself across that.
Now some people can -- circus workers, steel workers.
But it really changes the way you think.
And then, a psychologist, Alice Isen, did this wonderful experiment.
She brought students in to solve problems.
So, she'd bring people into the room, and there'd be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here.
It was an empty room, except for a table with a bunch of crap on it -- some papers and scissors and stuff.
And she'd bring them in, and she'd say, "This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life.
Would you tie those two strings together?"
So they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here and they couldn't reach the other string.
Still can't reach it.
And, basically, none of them could solve it.
You bring in a second group of people, and you say, "Oh, before we start, I got this box of candy, and I don't eat candy.
Would you like the box of candy?"
And turns out they liked it, and it made them happy -- not very happy, but a little bit of happy.
And guess what -- they solved the problem.
And it turns out that when you're anxious you squirt neural transmitters in the brain, which focuses you makes you depth-first.
And when you're happy -- what we call positive valence -- you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes, which makes you a breadth-first problem solver: you're more susceptible to interruption; you do out-of-the-box thinking.
That's what brainstorming is about, right?
With brainstorming we make you happy, we play games, and we say, "No criticism," and you get all these weird, neat ideas.
But in fact, if that's how you always were you'd never get any work done because you'd be working along and say, "Oh, I got a new way of doing it."
So to get work done, you've got to set a deadline, right?
You've got be anxious.
The brain works differently if you're happy. Things work better because you're more creative.
You get a little problem, you say, "Ah, I'll figure it out."
No big deal.
There's something I call the visceral level of processing, and there will be visceral-level design.
Biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors.
That's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits and bright plants, because you eat the fruit and you thereby spread the seed.
There's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain.
We dislike bitter tastes, we dislike loud sounds, we dislike hot temperatures, cold temperatures.
We dislike scolding voices. We dislike frowning faces; we like symmetrical faces, etc., etc.
So that's the visceral level.
In design, you can express visceral in lots of ways, like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot, exciting.
Or the 1963 Jaguar: It's actually a crummy car, falls apart all the time, but the owners love it.
And it's beautiful -- it's in the Museum of Modern Art.
A water bottle: You buy it because of the bottle, not because of the water.
And when people are finished, they don't throw it away.
They keep it for -- you know, it's like the old wine bottles, you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again, which proves it's not the water.
It's all about the visceral experience.
The middle level of processing is the behavioral level and that's actually where most of our stuff gets done.
Visceral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.
Behavioral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.
Almost everything we do is subconscious.
I'm walking around the stage -- I'm not attending to the control of my legs.
I'm doing a lot; most of my talk is subconscious; it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot.
Most of what we do is subconscious.
Automatic behavior -- skilled behavior -- is subconscious, controlled by the behavioral side.
And behavioral design is all about feeling in control, which includes usability, understanding -- but also the feel and heft.
That's why the Global knives are so neat.
They're so nicely balanced, so sharp, that you really feel you're in control of the cutting.
Or, just driving a high-performance sports car over a demanding curb -- again, feeling that you are in complete control of the environment.
Or the sensual feeling.
This is a Kohler shower, a waterfall shower, and actually, all those knobs beneath are also showerheads.
It will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hours -- and not waste water, by the way, because it recirculates the same dirty water.
Or this -- this is a really neat teapot I found at high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago.
It's a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot.
That's kind of what the teapot looks like but the way you use it is you lay it on its back, and you put tea in, and then you fill it with water.
The water then seeps over the tea.
And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right -- the tea is to the right of this line.
There's a little ledge inside, so the tea is sitting there and the water is filling it up like that.
And when the tea is ready, or almost ready, you tilt it.
And that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing.
And when it's finished, you put it vertically, and now the tea is -- you remember -- above this line and the water only comes to here -- and so it keeps the tea out.
On top of that, it communicates, which is what emotion does.
Emotion is all about acting; emotion is really about acting.
It's being safe in the world.
Cognition is about understanding the world, emotion is about interpreting it -- saying good, bad, safe, dangerous, and getting us ready to act, which is why the muscles tense or relax.
And that's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else -- because their muscles are acting, subconsciously, except that we've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion.
Well, this has emotions if you like, because it signals the waiter that, "Hey, I'm finished. See -- upright."
And the waiter can come by and say, "Would you like more water?"
It's kind of neat. What a wonderful design.
And the third level is reflective, which is, if you like the superego, it's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do, no control over the -- doesn't see the senses, doesn't control the muscles.
It looks over what's going on.
It's that little voice in your head that's watching and saying, "That's good. That's bad."
Or, "Why are you doing that? I don't understand."
It's that little voice in your head that's the seat of consciousness.
Here's a great reflective product.
Owners of the Hummer have said, "You know I've owned many cars in my life -- all sorts of exotic cars, but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention."
It's about attention. It's about their image, not about the car.
If you want a more positive model -- this is the GM car.
And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment.
And you'll buy it to protect the environment, even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive and not perfected.
But that's reflective design as well.
Or an expensive watch, so you can impress people -- "Oh gee, I didn't know you had that watch."
As opposed to this one, which is a pure behavioral watch, which probably keeps better time than the $13,000 watch I just showed you.
But it's ugly.
This is a clear Don Norman watch.
And what's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other, the visceral fear of falling against the reflective state saying, "It's OK. It's OK. It's safe. It's safe."
If that amusement park were rusty and falling apart, you'd never go on the ride.
So, it's pitting one against the other.
The other neat thing ...
So Jake Cress is this furniture maker, and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture.
And this is his chair with claw, and the poor little chair has lost its ball and it's trying to get it back before anybody notices.
And what's so neat about it is how you accept that story.
And that's what's nice about emotion.
So that's the new me.
I'm only saying positive things from now on.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_shows_how_kids_teach_themselves.html</url>
I have a tough job to do.
You know, when I looked at the profile of the audience here, with their connotations and design, in all its forms, and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks, and so on, that I wanted to tell you, I wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context.
In order to do that in 20 minutes, I have to bring out four ideas -- it's like four pieces of a puzzle.
And if I succeed in doing that, maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on, and perhaps help me do my work.
The first piece of the puzzle is remoteness and the quality of education.
Now, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things.
Of course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center, you get to remoter areas.
What happens to education?
The second, or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world, you have pockets, like slums, or shantytowns, or poorer areas, which are socially and economically remote from the rest of the city, so it's us and them.
What happens to education in that context?
So keep both of those ideas of remoteness.
We made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers.
If they do have, they cannot retain those teachers.
They do not have good enough infrastructure.
And if they had some infrastructure, they have difficulty maintaining it.
But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was we hired a car, looked up on Google, found a route into northern India from New Delhi which, you know, which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers, and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests, and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.
The graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully.
I mean, this is a very small sample; you should not generalize from it.
But it was quite obvious, quite clear, that for this particular route that I had taken, the remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be.
That seemed a little damning, and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure, or with the availability of electricity, and things like that.
To my surprise, it did not correlate.
It did not correlate with the size of classrooms.
It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure.
It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate.
But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire to each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers -- which was, "Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?" -- 69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that, they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi, and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi -- because, you know, those are relatively better off areas -- and then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes.
I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school, probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results.
So it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools, as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat, and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing. It appears that way.
When you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that, you know, things like websites, collaborative environments -- you've been listening to all that in the morning -- it's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools, and, according to me, biases the result.
The literature -- one part of it, the scientific literature -- consistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing.
The teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does.
Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting, let's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do.
You put in this new super-duper technology, and now they get 83 percent.
So the principal looks at it and says, 3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it.
If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools, where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing.
So the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make, would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top, but we seem to be doing it the other way about.
So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach the underprivileged first, not the other way about.
And finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception?
Whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology, the teacher's first reaction is, you cannot replace a teacher with a machine -- it's impossible.
I don't know why it's impossible, but, even for a moment, if you did assume that it's impossible -- I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke, the science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo, and he said something which completely solves this problem.
He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine, should be.
So, you know, it puts the teacher into a tough bind, you have to think.
Anyway, so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education, whatever alternative you want, is required where schools don't exist, where schools are not good enough, where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough, for whatever reason.
If you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies, then you don't need an alternative education.
So far I haven't come across such an area, except for one case. I won't name the area, but somewhere in the world people said, we don't have this problem, because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools.
There are such areas, but -- anyway, I'd never heard that anywhere else.
I'm going to talk about children and self-organization, and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like.
They're called the hole-in-the-wall experiments.
I'll have to really rush through this. They're a set of experiments.
The first one was done in New Delhi in 1999.
And what we did over there was pretty much simple.
I had an office in those days which bordered a slum, an urban slum, so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum.
They cut a hole inside that wall -- which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall -- and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end, a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall, put it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there, put it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there.
And this is what we saw.
So that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole-in-the-wall.
About eight hours later, we found this kid.
To the right is this eight-year-old child who -- and to his left is a six-year-old girl, who is not very tall.
And what he was doing was, he was teaching her to browse.
So it sort of raised more questions than it answered.
Is this real? Does the language matter, because he's not supposed to know English?
Will the computer last, or will they break it and steal it -- and did anyone teach them?
The last question is what everybody said, but you know, I mean, they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office, can you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him.
So I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it, this time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India, where I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything.
So it was a warm day, and the hole in the wall was on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there; he later on turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout.
He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad.
Very quickly, he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen -- and later on he told me, "I have never seen a television where you can do something."
So he figured that out. It took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television.
And then, as he was doing that, he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad -- you'll see him do that.
He did that, and the Internet Explorer changed page.
Eight minutes later, he looked from his hand to the screen, and he was browsing: he was going back and forth.
When that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children, like, children would come and see what's happening over here.
And by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing.
So eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there.
So we thought that this is what was happening: that children in groups can self-instruct themselves to use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances?
At this time there was a -- the main question was about English.
People said, you know, you really ought to have this in Indian languages.
So I said, have what, shall I translate the Internet into some Indian language? That's not possible.
So, it has to be the other way about.
But let's see, how do the children tackle the English language?
I took the experiment out to northeastern India, to a village called Madantusi, where, for some reason, there was no English teacher, so the children had not learned English at all.
And I built a similar hole-in-the-wall.
One big difference in the villages, as opposed to the urban slums: there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk.
In the urban slums, the girls tend to stay away.
I left the computer there with lots of CDs -- I didn't have any Internet -- and came back three months later.
So when I came back there, I found these two kids, eight- and 12-year-olds, who were playing a game on the computer.
And as soon as they saw me they said, "We need a faster processor and a better mouse."
I was real surprised.
You know, how on earth did they know all this?
And they said, "Well, we've picked it up from the CDs."
So I said, "But how did you understand what's going on over there?"
So they said, "Well, you've left this machine which talks only in English, so we had to learn English."
So then I measured, and they were using 200 English words with each other -- mispronounced, but correct usage -- words like exit, stop, find, save, that kind of thing, not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations.
So, Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier; in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to.
Finally, I got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else.
India is a good place to do such an experiment in, because we have all the ethnic diversities, all the -- you know, the genetic diversity, all the racial diversities, and also all the socio-economic diversities.
So, I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world.
So I did this for almost five years, and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of India.
This is the Himalayas. Up in the north, very cold.
I also had to check or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors, and I was using regular, normal PCs, so I needed different climates, for which India is also great, because we have very cold, very hot, and so on.
This is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border.
And you see here a little clip of -- one of these villages -- the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the English alphabet.
Then to central India -- very warm, moist, fishing villages, where humidity is a very big killer of electronics.
So we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power, so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running.
I want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again.
This sequence is also nice. This is a small child, a six-year-old, telling his eldest sister what to do.
And this happens very often with these computers, that the younger children are found teaching the older ones.
What did we find? We found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct in a connected environment, irrespective of anything that we could measure.
So if they have access to the computer, they will teach themselves, including intelligence.
I couldn't find a single correlation with anything, but it had to be in groups.
And that may be of great, you know, interest to this group, because all of you are talking about groups.
So here was the power of what a group of children can do, if you lift the adult intervention.
Just a quick idea of the measurements.
We took standard statistical techniques, so I'm going to not talk about that.
But we got a clean learning curve, almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school.
I'll leave it at that, because, I mean, it sort of says it all, doesn't it?
What could they learn to do?
Basic Windows functions, browsing, painting, chatting and email, games and educational material, music downloads, playing video.
In short, what all of us do.
And over 300 children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer.
So, how do they do that?
If you calculated the actual time of access, it would work out to minutes per day, so that's not how it's happening.
What you have, actually, is there is one child operating the computer.
And surrounding him are usually three other children, who are advising him on what they should do.
If you test them, all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them.
Around these four are usually a group of about 16 children, who are also advising, usually wrongly, about everything that's going on on the computer.
And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject.
So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing.
It seems counter-intuitive to adult learning, but remember, eight-year-olds live in a society where most of the time they are told, don't do this, you know, don't touch the whiskey bottle.
So what does the eight-year-old do?
He observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched.
And if you tested him, he would answer every question correctly on that topic.
So, they seem to be able to acquire very quickly.
So what was the conclusion over the six years of work?
It was that primary education can happen on its own, or parts of it can happen on its own.
It does not have to be imposed from the top downwards.
It could perhaps be a self-organizing system, so that was the second bit that I wanted to tell you, that children can self-organize and attain an educational objective.
The third piece was on values, and again, to put it very briefly, I conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over India, and asked them -- I gave them about 68 different values-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions.
We got all sorts of opinions. Yes, no or I don't know.
I simply took those questions where I got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes -- so I was able to get a collection of 16 such statements.
These were areas where the children were clearly confused, because half said yes and half said no.
A typical example being, "Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies."
They don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question; perhaps none of us do.
So I leave you with this third question.
Can technology alter the acquisition of values?
Finally, self-organizing systems, about which, again, I won't say too much because you've been hearing all about it.
Natural systems are all self-organizing: galaxies, molecules, cells, organisms, societies -- except for the debate about an intelligent designer.
But at this point in time, as far as science goes, it's self-organization.
But other examples are traffic jams, stock market, society and disaster recovery, terrorism and insurgency.
And you know about the Internet-based self-organizing systems.
So here are my four sentences then.
Remoteness affects the quality of education.
Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first, and other areas later.
Values are acquired; doctrine and dogma are imposed -- the two opposing mechanisms.
And learning is most likely a self-organizing system.
If you put all the four together, then it gives -- according to me -- it gives us a goal, a vision, for educational technology.
An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital, automatic, fault-tolerant, minimally invasive, connected and self-organized.
As educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it.
PowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology, but it was not meant for education, it was meant for making boardroom presentations.
We borrowed it. Video conferencing. The personal computer itself.
I think it's time that the educationists made their own specs, and I have such a set of specs. This is a brief look at that.
And such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness, values and violence.
So I thought I'd give it a name -- why don't we call it "outdoctrination."
And could this be a goal for educational technology in the future?
So I want to leave that as a thought with you.
Thank you.

My story is a little bit about war.
It's about disillusionment.
It's about death.
And it's about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage.
And perhaps also, there's a lesson about how to deal with our screwed-up, fragmenting and dangerous world of the 21st century.
I don't believe in straightforward narratives.
I don't believe in a life or history written as decision "A" led to consequence "B" led to consequence "C" -- these neat narratives that we're presented with, and that perhaps we encourage in each other.
I believe in randomness, and one of the reasons I believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random.
I'm colorblind.
I was born unable to see most colors.
This is why I wear gray and black most of the time, and I have to take my wife with me to chose clothes.
And I'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy.
I loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside.
And it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot.
And I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot, and sure enough, I failed.
I couldn't see all the blinking different lights, So I had to choose another career, and this was in fact relatively easy for me, because I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood, which was international relations.
As a child, I read the newspaper thoroughly.
I was fascinated by the Cold War, by the INF negotiations over intermediate-range nuclear missiles, the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S.
in Angola or Afghanistan.
These things really interested me.
And so I decided quite at an early age I wanted to be a diplomat.
And I, one day, I announced this to my parents -- and my father denies this story to this day -- I said, "Daddy, I want to be a diplomat."
And he turned to me, and he said, "Carne, you have to be very clever to be a diplomat."
And my ambition was sealed.
In 1989, I entered the British Foreign Service.
That year, 5,000 people applied to become a diplomat, and 20 of us succeeded.
And as those numbers suggest, I was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world.
Being a diplomat, then and now, is an incredible job, and I loved every minute of it -- I enjoyed the status of it.
I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes and reveled in this amazing access I had to world events.
I traveled to the Gaza Strip.
I headed the Middle East Peace Process section in the British Foreign Ministry.
I became a speechwriter for the British Foreign Secretary.
I met Yasser Arafat.
I negotiated with Saddam's diplomats at the U.N.
Later, I traveled to Kabul and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban.
And I would travel in a C-130 transport and go and visit warlords in mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan, surrounded by my Special Forces escort, who, themselves, had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines, because it was so dangerous.
And that was exciting -- that was fun.
It was really interesting.
And it's a great cadre of people, incredibly close-knit community of people.
And the pinnacle of my career, as it turned out, was when I was posted to New York.
I'd already served in Germany, Norway, various other places, but I was posted to New York to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation.
And my responsibility was the Middle East, which was my specialty.
And there, I dealt with things like the Middle East peace process, the Lockerbie issue -- we can talk about that later, if you wish -- but above all, my responsibility was Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on Iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons.
I was the chief British negotiator on the subject, and I was steeped in the issue.
And anyway, my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time.
I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy.
We went through several wars during my time in New York.
I negotiated for my country the resolution in the Security Council of the 12th of September 2001 condemning the attacks of the day before, which were, of course, deeply present to us actually living in New York at the time.
So it was kind of the best of time, worst of times kind of experience.
I lived the high-life.
Although I worked very long hours, I lived in a penthouse in Union Square.
I was a single British diplomat in New York City; you can imagine what that might have meant.
I had a good time.
