I should like to congratulate Mr Camisón Asensio on his report.
In it he emphasises how petitions allow the citizens to make their legitimate aspirations known and also draw attention to the inherent weaknesses of Community legislation. The Commission is interested in your work on both these counts, ladies and gentlemen.
As an outside observer, allow me to reiterate what I said earlier to Mrs González.
I believe that the Committee on Petitions in this House does serve to bring the citizens closer to the institutions in general. The same is true of similar committees in other Parliaments I am acquainted with, for instance in my own country' s parliament, with which I am most familiar.
They play a key part precisely in bringing the citizens closer to the institutions in general. They are also invaluable to the work of Members themselves, making them aware of issues a significant number of citizens feel are sensitive and worthy of concern.
This last year, not only have the Commission' s services cooperated with this Committee, but we Commissioners have also made it our business to cooperate actively with you, ladies and gentlemen. I would therefore like to thank Mr Gemelli for his remark.
It is certainly the case that Mr Kinnock, Mr Liikanen, Mrs Wallström and Mr Bolkestein have contributed to your work. They have come in person to discuss and explain issues.
They have tried to adduce reasons, possibilities or solutions to concerns expressed by the Committee on Petitions further to requests or complaints by citizens. This proves how much we in the Commission value your work, ladies and gentlemen.
In this connection I should like to reiterate what I said earlier. The Commission will respond in as open and constructive a manner as possible to your desire for strengthened cooperation.
I appreciate that the time it sometimes takes for us to respond to a query is a problem. Nonetheless, I am sure the House is aware that on most if not all occasions when problems were experienced they arose because the Commission was dependent on a Member State for information.
We have to deal with different administrations.
The only way we can obtain certain types of information from Member States is by exerting political pressure.
There are no other means at our disposal.
The Commission brings pressure to bear in the same way as you do, ladies and gentlemen. We publicise the fact that the Member State in question has failed to respond to a query or is hindering a response by the Commission.
I can only promise that the Commission will continue to urge Member States to act on queries as quickly as possible, supplying the information requested. We will then be able to respond appropriately to the concerns raised by you.
In that sense we shall endeavour to continue cooperating fully with the House.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Sugar and preparations intended for human consumption
The next item is the report (A5-0217/2001) by Mr Lannoye on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the simplification of certain directives on foodstuffs under the draft Council directives concerning the simplification of the vertical directives on foodstuffs: Proposals for Council directives relating to:
1. certain sugars intended for human consumption
(13003/1992 - C5-0346/1999 - 1996/0113(CNS));
2. honey
(8701/2000 - C5-0347/1999 - 1996/0114(CNS));
3. fruit juices and certain similar products intended for human consumption
(13760/1999) - C5-0348/1999 - 1996/0115(CNS));
4. certain partly or wholly dehydrated preserved milk for human consumption
(14002/1999 - C5-0349/1999 - 1999/0116(CNS));
5. fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and chestnut purée intended for human consumption
(7138/2000 - C5-0350/1999 - 1996/0118(CNS)) (Renewed consultation) [14003/1999 - C5-0346/1999 - 1996/0113(CNS)].
Mr President, we are being asked to discuss directives about breakfast at the end of the morning.
It is a little late, but I am still going to attempt it.
I would first of all like to point out that this is the second time that we have been consulted on this issue.
In the previous legislature, Parliament gave its opinion on the Commission' s proposals on the simplification of vertical directives on sugar, honey, fruit juices, milk and jams.
The Council took a great deal of time to finalise the case and finally made significant changes to the Commission' s initial proposals.
This is why we are being consulted again today.
I therefore remind you that the idea was to simplify the directives.
The point of view of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is certainly compatible with this objective, but it also consists of not abandoning quality requirements in the name of simplification, and above all not compromising on good consumer information.
All the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, a large proportion of which came from the rapporteur, have this aim.
I would like to point out that the consensus in the Council obviously limits our room for manoeuvre, as we are simply being consulted, that is to say that following our vote today, the Council will, at the end of the day, be completely free to decide.
Nevertheless, I think that the amendments succeed in improving the texts from the point of view that I just specified: quality of products and correct consumer information.
I am going to review the various directives in order to give the main elements of them.
First of all, on sugars, there is a small problem of definition.
The Council, quite rightly, has defined a sugar that is being increasingly used, fructose, but it failed to give a definition of what it calls brown sugar.
Parliament' s amendment therefore asks for a definition in the texts.
A deadline needs to be imposed, but the Commission needs to propose a definition.
That seems elementary.
The second case, that of honey.
This is a sensitive case insofar as honey is a high quality product, usually produced on a small scale, with which there have been many marketing problems in previous years, inasmuch as we often see mixtures of honeys and also honeys coming onto the European Union market whose quality is not guaranteed.
We therefore need to be vigilant on definitions and labelling.
The Commission proposes adding a new category of honey, filtered honey.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposes that we do not accept this proposal, as filtered honey is in fact a honey whose floral origin cannot be checked.
Most of the time it has lost the pollen that allows this to be checked, which prevents the product from being well defined and goes against a guarantee of quality for consumers.
We therefore propose that we do not accept this proposal.
With regard to harmful substances that may be found in honey for industry or baker' s honey, we think that it should be forbidden for them to be present in honey.
We are of course talking about lower quality honeys, which are used as raw materials in certain preparations in the agricultural and food industry, but there is no question of accepting the presence of harmful substances.
There is therefore an amendment from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in this respect.
The third case, that of fruit juices.
I think that the majority of the amendments are aimed not at making major changes to the proposal from the Commission and the Council, but rather at clarifying the texts and preventing them from going off course.
I will explain: we do not feel that a non-exhaustive list of treatments and substances authorised for production, as it is envisaged, is satisfactory.
A positive list should be given.
We therefore ask the Commission to put forward, within a certain period, a positive list of filtration adjuvants, precipitation agents and absorption adjuvants.
A positive list means that substances that are not on the list are forbidden.
We think that this is clearer, in the end, and more positive for consumers.
An amendment also asks for fungicides not to be used to preserve fruits to be used to make juices, but for only preservation by chilling to be permitted.
With regard to the fourth case, that of milk, there are no proposals for modification.
We think that the text proposed to us is quite satisfactory.
For jams, I personally reintroduced an amendment that was not accepted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but which I hold to.
It concerns not accepting the general use of a chemical flavouring in jams and marmalades, that is vanillin.
It does not strictly do anything apart from altering the taste.
Mr President, it is about five years ago that the Council consulted us on the proposal to simplify seven vertical directives on foodstuffs.
The aim of those proposals was to simplify the existing legislation, which contains far too much detail, or to replace it by directives containing only the essential requirements.
In that way, they would be easier to implement and better correspond to the horizontal directives.
This is a commendable effort which is in line with the expectations of both consumers and those who are involved in other ways.
We, the PPE-DE Group, are keen to lend our support in this connection.
We have established that the Directive on cocoa and chocolate products, which also originally formed part of this package and which had to undergo the lengthiest legislative procedure, namely that of co-decision, was the first one we managed to complete.
As for the five other directives of the package of seven, the five we are debating today, we will ultimately require more than five years to complete the simplification procedure.
We do wonder if we should not aspire to faster working methods and other decision-making methods, for we do not believe that that is what the public wants.
The PPE-DE Group would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work.
The delay is certainly not due to him, but due to the fact that the Council has fundamentally changed certain components, thus necessitating fresh advice from us.
On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I can say that we are in agreement with the report as it emerged from the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
That is the case for all components of the package, except for fruit juices.
On these, our view differs slightly from that in the report, but that was also apparent in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I do not believe, therefore, that I need to go into any more detail here regarding the reasoning, motives and strands of thought behind that difference of view.
However, I do not want to conceal the fact - and I should like to devote the rest of my speaking time to this - that we in our group, further to these issues arising, have held a serious debate on the issue of whether it is really up to a Parliament to discuss such detailed measures with 626 Members.
This is creating problems for us.
Parliament is being slated for this from outside.
That does not mean that we underestimate the importance of food legislation.
We realise that the detail is important in this connection, but we do wonder whether, with the material being at such a high technical level, we really are the people best placed to take the decisions and whether we should inconvenience 626 MEPs with these kinds of far-reaching, technical measures.
The question we asked ourselves is: should we not move towards two kinds of derived legislation, one on which Parliament deliberates and another which, surely, should be entrusted to the executive?
This discussion has certainly not reached its conclusion, but I should welcome a discussion which includes groups other than the PPE-DE Group.
Mr President, back in 1998 this Parliament approved the five directives under discussion today with amendments.
They have been referred back to us simply because there are some changes to the comitology procedure.
I note with satisfaction that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has no objections to the revised procedure.
It is, however, proposing new textual changes to the draft directive.
The purpose of the directives is to simplify rules governing composition and labelling.
We should therefore avoid complicating matters.
Political agreement has been reached on this issue after long and arduous negotiations and we should therefore avoid reopening the negotiations at all costs.
I agree with changes that add clarity to texts but do not change the substance.
One case in point is the inclusion of the definition of brown sugar.
This would be an added protection for consumers.
In relation to fruit juices, the proposed changes to the treatments and substances would be more appropriate within the horizontal legislation governing these treatments.
The suggestion to introduce three new product names for fruit juices is not in line with proposals currently under discussion on the Codex.
Furthermore, they will only serve to reopen the entire debate.
I do not believe that substantial changes, if adopted by this House, will achieve anything.
They will only serve to delay the procedure.
If that happens, it is the consumers who will be the losers in the end.
Mr President, talking about food is not very easy these days.
If we then turn to purely technical aspects such as those addressed by Mr Lannoye, the complications increase.
We find ourselves in agreement with his report, except for the point raised by Mr Thyssen.
However the point I want to make is not about the actual merit of the report, but rather about an evaluation that this Parliament needs to carry out over the next few months on the future legislative method.
We also found certain points in this report where we have either aggravated the situation or intervened in legislation already dealt with in the course of the last two months, and here I am thinking, for example, of problems relating to water.
Coordinated production of legislation can, I think, only be helpful to this institution.
Another aspect I want to bring up is the excessive regulation to which we subject our legislative process, which is not reflected in our Member States.
In the Member States a whole series of areas are dealt with through the method of circulars.
As regards the report we drew up last year with the Commission, we will have to think very carefully about those issues, because I do not think a consumer who is buying honey is immediately aware of whether it is honey produced in beehives or filtered honey, even if the label is clear.
As our task is to be impartial and we need to produce legislation that is comprehensible to European citizens, perhaps further thought is necessary over the next few months.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen: I would like to make use of the short time available to me to comment on Article 3 of the Directive on fruit juices.
Today, we are increasingly advocating information and clarification for consumers.
Responsible, adult consumers, getting information from product labels, are meant to decide for themselves what they buy.
Strict, clear, unambiguous regulations, the thinking behind which is clear to all, must be enacted.
Descriptions such as 'juice' , 'fruit juice' , 'nectar' , 'fruit juice from concentrate' or even 'contains fruit' make it difficult for consumers to assess a product's true quality or know how it was produced.
It was in 1975 that the Fruit Juice Directive first introduced consumers to the designation 'fruit juice' or reinforced it, and consumers have got used to it.
'Fruit juice' and 'fruit juice from concentrate' are in the final analysis one and the same product.
The designation 'fruit juice from concentrate' refers only to the manufacturing process and not to the ingredients, which must of course be the same.
The additional designation 'with concentrates' tends in my view to confuse.
Product designations must be clearly defined, simple and comprehensible.
We must prevent additional descriptions which are not absolutely necessary, as confusion is no protection for consumers.
In my view, the proposed Amendments Nos 18, 19 and 25 make the current legal position stricter in an unjustifiable way, particularly for the juice industry, and I believe they should be rejected.
Fruit to be sold fresh in markets, in other words for consumption, may be treated with fungicides.
Why, then, not fruit for juice production?
In exactly the same way, the criteria of the EU Drinking Water Directive must suffice for the water which has to be used in the preparation of fruit juice.
I would ask you therefore, ladies and gentlemen, to vote objectively and purposefully to set a directive on course which will help the consumer and which manufacturers will be able to implement.
Mr President, I share some of Mrs Thyssens' reservations about what we are being asked to do here and the degree of expertise with which we do it.
Mr Lannoye knows he has my respect, but I have to say with some regret that I fear we are repeating some of the debating errors of the chocolate directive and the determination to rechristen some products.
Mr Lannoye's amendments have caused confusion in the name of purity when we come to the issue of honey.
I agree with him about fruit juice and I certainly salute his motives.
But there are a number of Member States which use filtered honey extensively to remove insect debris, grains of sand and pollen fragments.
I have heard no convincing argument that this damage of the product adds unwanted material and indeed there are other amendments before us today which call for the removal of organic and inorganic material from some honeys.
The Council had arrived at a sensible position on this and I have seen no evidence - and I have checked back with our own Food Standards Agency - that there are any legitimate concerns about content.
There are other ways of tracing the origins of honey, as well as the pollen content to which the rapporteur has referred.
Finally I would like to look at what a number of Member States call 'baker's honey' , which is to be redefined, if the rapporteur has his way, as 'industrial honey' .
There is no such thing.
I would like to think this was an unwitting translation error but this derogatory phraseology is probably not accidental.
By just putting a noun with an adjective you cannot always make sense.
If I were to describe Mr Lannoye, whom I hold in esteem as an 'industrial Belgian' , it would be a meaningless phrase.
We should use a real description understood throughout the Community, not an invented one.
This is not a product only fit to grease the wheels of industry.
It is a product that people know and have confidence in and it is safe for consumers.
Mr President, Commissioner, as time is short I shall only refer to the directive on fruit juice.
The Commission' s proposal is sound and does not require amendment.
In particular, I welcome the double definition of juice from concentrate and fruit juice. It helps to keep the consumer better informed.
Consequently I cannot support Amendment No 39, deleting the Commission' s text. I do support Amendment No 30 dealing with the subject in greater depth and referring back to Annex 1.
Further, I totally reject Amendments Nos 18, 19, 23 and 25.
The first of these concerns a ban on the use of fungicides in treatments after gathering.
It has to be borne in mind that fruit gathered in Europe is in principle destined for the fresh fruit trade. The decision on which fruit will be sold fresh and which will be processed is only taken following selection by quantity and size.
Directive 97/41/EC has already set a maximum limit for residue in the case of fresh fruit, based on detailed studies to ensure consumer safety.
I believe this Directive applies equally to juice, fresh fruit, juice produced in the home, or packaged juice.
Treatment after gathering is required to guarantee optimum storage, transport and distribution conditions. I should like to reiterate what I said earlier.
A substance may not be harmful in itself, it depends on the amount used. Regarding the quality of the water added to concentrates, Directive 98/93/EC refers to the quality of water for human consumption, including water used by the food industry.
Finally, Amendment No 23 calls for a list of authorised substances to be drawn up.
It does not make sense to specify additional substances over and above those referred to in Directives 89/109/EEC and 90/128/EEC on materials and objects liable to come into contact with foodstuffs. This would restrict the juice industry' s capacity to adjust quickly to technological developments.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, food and consumer protection have become vexatious topics.
They also involve a great deal of uncertainty.
This report should achieve greater clarity, and Mr Lannoye has evidently put a great deal of effort into it.
I believe, however, that too much exactitude and too many details can also be dangerous, and with this in mind I can only support what was said by Mrs Thyssen: here, and also in our work generally, we should distinguish more and more between political statements and technical considerations.
We are also overstretched in many respects, not through our average IQ being so low, but simply because the specialised technical knowledge cannot be present, because simply too much is presupposed and we then also have difficulty at some point in deciding what is lobbying and what is meaningful activity.
I also believe that we should be careful when deciding on the details of labels, so that we do not, through the sheer compulsion to regulate - as for example with fruit juices, where, however, we have now reached a compromise - end up leading the consumer astray with duplicated explanations and elucidations.
If we carry on that way, even wines will soon have to carry their chemical composition on the label, and then the marketing of wine will no doubt be far less straightforward.
I am glad to be able to thank all those who have contributed to reaching compromises - in the field of fruit juices, on the subjects of fungicides, water adulteration and the juice and concentrate issue, as well as on aromas - and hope that, in the problematic area of honey, it is impossible to conceal the product's origin.
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, when voting, to pay careful attention to this as well.


Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the directive on fruit juices, I would like to indicate our agreement with the Council' s proposal, which we think is going in the right direction, that is to say towards effective protection for consumers, who need to be provided with clear, easy to understand and objective information that will enable them to make a completely informed choice, both in terms of quality and in terms of food safety.
The higher production costs associated with the effort and the quality guarantee must, however, be clearly acknowledged in labelling.
There are currently, depending on whether they are free of concentrate or made from concentrate, two major categories of fruit juices, each of which correspond to the nature of specific products and a particular production process.
In terms of labelling, current practice does not enable consumers to clearly distinguish between these two categories.
In order to remove this source of confusion in the mind of consumers as to the actual nature of the product that they are buying, the Finnish Presidency has proposed introducing two simple, clear and objective definitions.
The term 'fruit juice' would be reserved for juices without concentrate, while, according to them, juices made from concentrate should be named for sale purposes in accordance with their characteristics.
Thus, consumers looking for a more authentic and more natural product will easily be able to find it on the shelf under the clear name 'fruit juice' , knowing that they are prepared to pay the price corresponding to the specific qualities associated with this product, while consumers inclined towards a more standardised and cheaper product will be able to turn with full knowledge of the facts towards a juice made from concentrate without any ambiguity about its nature and particular characteristics.
We, think, Mr President, that defining these two categories of juice, corresponding to two different names, represents real progress in consumer information, and that is why we support it.
Mr President, I too shall refer only to the directive on fruit juice, as time is short.
Along with previous speakers, we believe that the Council' s proposal represents definite progress because it establishes a clear distinction between fresh fruit juice and concentrated juice.
This is a welcome development as it provides consumers with full information on two products with different characteristics produced in very different ways.
We cannot therefore support any amendment aimed at blurring or doing away with the distinction established so clearly in the Council' s text.
Further, we cannot accept the amendments aimed at ending the use of fruit from the fresh market. This is what would result if we agreed to ban treatment after gathering.
The use of this fruit makes it possible to provide the consumer with a healthy product, manufactured to high standards of quality and food safety. It is also a way of utilising surplus agricultural production so that large quantities are not allowed to rot and pollute the environment.
Consequently, we shall support the Council' s proposal and vote in its favour.
In our view, the majority of the amendments tabled in committee do not serve to clarify or improve the situation. Instead, they cause further confusion.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I first wish to thank the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and you in particular, Mr Lannoye, as rapporteur, for examining the drafts of the five so-called vertical directives communicated to you by the Council.
These directives relate to sugars intended for human consumption, to honey, to fruit juices and similar products intended for human consumption, to certain partly or wholly dehydrated preserved milk for human consumption and to fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and chestnut purée intended for human consumption.
The Commission welcomes the way that Parliament has kept to the guidelines given by the Council on comitology and has thereby agreed to replace the advisory committee procedure by the regulatory committee procedure.
As regards the amendments to the Council's five drafts, the Commission notes that Parliament had been heard as early as 1996 on the corresponding proposals by the Commission and had adopted positions on them in the sittings of 14 January 1998 and 4 May 1999.
Even though some of these amendments appear to me thoroughly sensible from the editorial or technical point of view, I regret however that I must point out that, as has been said, we are dealing here with Council drafts and not with original proposals by the Commission and that these amendments therefore apply to the Council drafts and not to the Commission's proposals.
I must therefore, unfortunately, observe that the Commission cannot accept the amendments proposed in the report.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.49 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon.)

Mr President, I have no wish to hold up the vote but this morning I raised an objection to the session minutes under Rule 148(3).
Rule 148(3) requires a decision by Parliament.
No such decision has been taken.
I just wanted to know what happens to my objection now.
Secondly, I should like to point out that we decided yesterday to adopt the Commission proposal on which I reported.
We then adopted a legislative resolution rejecting the Commission proposal.
The services changed this in the Minutes to 'approves the Commission proposal' .
However, item 4 still contains a sentence which contradicts the first decision because it still says that the upper ceiling is to be maintained, which was something we rejected at the outset.
Because of this contradiction in the current draft minutes, I have asked that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs should be instructed to look into the matter with a view to making a general amendment to the Rules of Procedure clarifying what happens when this sort of contradiction arises.
I just wanted to point out that no decision has yet been taken on my objection to the minutes, as required under Article 148 (3).
I assume that the Minutes have not been approved on this point and will not therefore be approved until a later date.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr Swoboda is making a mistake and I would ask you to consider it carefully.
Parliament did indeed make a slightly contradictory decision yesterday, I repeat a slightly contradictory decision.
We adopted the Commission proposal on the transit system by a clear majority of 303 votes to 253.
The proposal says that the previous upper ceiling is to be abolished.
Parliament approved this by a clear majority.
In my view, item 4 has been included because of a faux pas by a number of colleagues.
However, there is still no material contradiction here because we also call on the Commission in item 4 to maintain an upper ceiling until the ecopoint system expires.
In other words, we clearly decided in the legislative act to adopt the Commission proposal.
If the Council agrees, and I hope that it does, then all will be well.
The second call in item 4 is a call for the Commission to reflect.
What the Commission does in this case, whether it proposes a new upper ceiling or no upper ceiling, is up to the Commission.
We did not, as you will see if you read the second clause, call for the old upper ceiling; we said the Commission might like to consider setting a new, reasonable upper ceiling.
However, this faux pas was carried by a majority.
All that means, however, is that the Commission has been asked to reflect and submit an opinion to Parliament once it has done so.
Parliament's clear position was, is, and remains - and in this respect there is nothing to correct, Mr Swoboda - that we approved the Commission's position yesterday by a large majority and I should like to confirm as much.
Mr Swoboda, Mr Jarzembowski, it is my understanding that the longer you talk, the more you seem to be seeing eye to eye.
We will have this carefully examined and you will be informed of the outcome in due course.
VOTE
Ladies and gentlemen, having consulted the relevant services, I do not wish to state the Commission's definitive position at this moment in time.
The Commission reserves the right to re-examine this matter.
I now give the floor to the rapporteur, Mr Cappato.
You can now do one of two things.
You can in any event inform Parliament of whether you endorse the proposal, in which case we will proceed to vote on the legislative resolution.
Alternatively, the proposal can also be referred back to committee.
Mr Cappato, please let us know what you decide to do.
Mr President, in view of the outcome of the vote and the high number of abstentions, I think it would be prudent, not for the rapporteur but for the House, to remit this report to committee.
(The matter was referred back to the committee responsible)
Report (A5-0271/2001) by Mrs Ries, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending for the 24th time Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (pentabromodiphenyl ether) [COM(2001) 12 - C5-0018/2001 - 2001/0018(COD)]
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0272/2001) by Mr Nisticò, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive setting standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage, and distribution of human blood and blood components and amending Council Directive 89/381/EEC [COM(2000) 816 - C5-0034/2001 - 2000/0323(COD)]

Mr President, as rapporteur I would like to ask you and the House to accept my proposal to vote on Amendment No 75 before Amendments Nos 55 and 56. This is to make the sequence of amendments logical, given that Amendment No 75 can replace Amendments Nos 55 and 56.
There will also be an oral amendment, which I support, to Amendment No 75, presented by Mr Lisi and Mr Santini, and an Amendment No 43, presented by Mr Tannock and Mrs Korhola, which I also support.
Mr President, the question Mr Nisticò is raising here about changing the voting order has been discussed, I believe, in the course of the last 10 days with Mr Nisticò, and we reached the conclusion evident from the voting list a long time ago. I do not therefore understand at all why Mr Nisticò is raising the issue now.
Amendments Nos 55 and 56 should clearly be voted on before Amendment No 75, and there has been agreement about this for quite a long time.
However, it seems that Mr Nisticò still wants to try to raise doubts about the matter.
I do not understand why.
I can be quite clear about this, Mr Nisticò.
We must apply the Rules of Procedure in this instance, too, and the order of voting, which was re-examined by the services before you spoke, is the correct order, and that order is ultimately to be decided on by the President.
I believe that we are thus following the correct order.
Mr President, I was asking the House to decide - because the House is sovereign - whether I can change a sequence I regard as illogical.
I therefore insist on putting my proposal to the vote to see who is in favour and who is against.
Mr Nisticò, you said two things.
We will deal with the compromise amendment later.
You can present it later, and then the House can decide whether or not it accepts it.
The order of voting on amendments is ultimately a matter for the President to decide, however.
I call on my authority to maintain the order of voting, advised by the services.
That is the reasonable order.
Once again, we can vote on a possible oral amendment, should this prove appropriate, in a moment.
Mr President, Mr Nisticò said there was an oral amendment to Amendment No 43, which is one of the ones you are trying to take en bloc.
If the oral amendment pertains to Amendment No 43 which forms part of the bloc vote, then you can read it out, in which case we will deal with this matter now before we vote en bloc.
Is that right, Mr Nisticò?
Absolutely right.
Mr Tannock is presenting that amendment.
The oral amendment to Amendment No 43 can now be clarified.
Mr President, the oral amendment I proposed to Amendment No 43 by Mr Lund is to replace his second paragraph.
This is one that I have reached a compromise on with Mrs Korhola.
It states the following: "In the case of shortage of certain plasma products, and solely with regards to the importation into the EU from countries outside of the EU, the Member States may permit exemptions to the directive provided the quality and safety requirements laid down are met."
This is absolutely essential to safeguard the interests of European haemophiliacs who rely, occasionally, on imported Factor VIII plasma products which may contain some donated and some sold blood from the United States.
So this is absolutely essential, if we are not to put in jeopardy the lives of British and other haemophiliacs.
It has the support of myself and Mrs Korhola.
I understand Mr Lund will support it as well.
Following the vote on Amendments Nos 55 and 56. President.
As we are familiar with the procedure when oral amendments are tabled, I have to ask the House whether there are any objections.
Twelve Members or more can object to voting on this oral amendment.
I would ask if the amendment can be accepted.
I see more than twelve Members.
This oral amendment is therefore not put to the vote.
I suggest we address this in a practical manner and vote on Amendment No 43 in a moment.
We will now vote en bloc on all 60 committee amendments, except for Amendment No 43.

Mr President, I am sorry you could not give me the floor when I asked for it before the vote on Amendments Nos 55 and 56, precisely because the oral amendment was intended to allow the House to decide whether it could unite behind the compromise incorporated into my proposal before voting on Amendments Nos 55 and 56.
At this point, as the first part has fallen because unfortunately I was not given a chance to speak, it is absolutely pointless to take the oral amendment, which related to the first part.
I am sorry, because if we had accepted the reversal of the order, as the rapporteur proposed, I would have been able to present it.
I tried to do so before the House voted, I did not get the floor and this is the result.
Mr President, before we vote on this motion, I should like to point out that, if we vote in favour of this motion, we shall be in serious violation of European primary law, by which I mean the fundamental Treaties of the European Union.
It is unacceptable, in a democratically constructed Europe, for the Ombudsman to be given control over Members.
It is unacceptable for Members to be accountable, irrespective of how much one approves of and supports the office of the ombudsman.
(Applause)
Mr von Boetticher, we will not be debating the content of the amendments during the voting.
That was not the agreement.
You know yourself that the House is very aware of the content of the amendments.
Mr Duff, you are not allowed to make any comments regarding the content.
We will not be holding a constitutional debate.
You can make a very brief comment, if you so wish, on a point of order, but not on the content.
Mr President, should I be unable to speak about the content, I would only say that the previous remark from the PPE side of the House is complete baloney.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is high time we voted.
Mr President, I simply wish to ask you to inform the House that the rapporteur is against this amendment.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0236/2001) by Mr Camisón Asensio, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the parliamentary year 2000-2001 [2001/2010(INI)]
Rule 175 of the Rules of Procedure
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, I did not want to interrupt the vote earlier but I should like to refer back to the Nisticò report.
Dr Tannock drew to our attention the question of concern about the supply of blood and plasma products for haemophiliacs if the source of supply is outside the Union.
I am not well-informed on the facts of the matter but my impression was that his intervention was based on verifiable facts rather than simply issues of political preference.
When we deal with legislation which intimately affects human health we must exercise great care and attention.
I ask you, Mr President, to ask the services to prepare a note on the facts of this matter so we can bring it to the attention of our colleagues in the groups.
I fear we may have voted in error.
Mr Cox, I shall naturally ask the services to examine everything very carefully.
That goes without saying, and certainly upon your express wishes.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Cappato Report (A5-0270)/2001)
Mr President, I close my eyes and what do I see?
I am in Venice, the most beautiful city in the world!
There is the moon, there are the gondolas, we are on the Grand Canal, Italian cooking, spaghetti with sepia, Dom Pérignon French champagne and a blonde beauty who takes me back to my youth.
However, because of lack of secrecy on personal data and lack of protection of privacy, when I get home I find my suitcases outside the door: my wife found out!
That is why I have voted in favour, Mr President.
But was it a dream I was talking about or was it reality?
- (NL) Many people in the Netherlands have self-adhesive labels on their letter boxes against commercial printed matter.
It has increasingly become the norm that ignoring this sign is rude and even unlawful.
Such a regulation has meanwhile become known as an opt-out, whereby the recipients themselves must make it known that they do not wish to receive such mail.
An opt-in, which requires an instruction that one does wish to receive commercial mail, would be preferable still.
In the case of electronic communication, there is even more reason for having such an opt-in, for it would prevent consumers from being harassed by unwanted communications they receive and need to delete, and for which they also have to pay.
Moreover, the e-mail system is also being weighed down by this deluge of advertising and is thus becoming unusable for reliable communications.
The Commission is right to propose such an opt-in in Article 13.
I am rather shocked by the view of the rapporteur, who appears to choose an opt-out which will only free consumers from the inconvenience after they have expressly lodged their protests.
Furthermore, people have already had bad experiences with pledges from organisations which make their money through direct marketing.
The protection of privacy, which the Directive is right to have as its objective, is seriously threatened by Mr Cappato' s view.
Mr President, I would like to make explanations of vote on two reports combined: on the Cappato and Cederschiöld reports.
I voted against both these reports.
There is a great danger, first of all, in relation to the blanket retention of information on users.
It raises serious questions about civil liberties.
With cybercrime we have the situation where new forms of crime are being created.
The lack of attention to civil liberties, the lack of attention to people's basic right to privacy is being overlooked.
There is a great danger here that in future we will have a society where people are afraid to communicate and use modern technology because they know that their communications will be intercepted, listened to, and be in the hands of people who have no right to them.
Before we start looking at bringing in legislation in these areas we should first of all ensure that people's basic rights and civil liberties are protected.
Both are enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and in the EU Treaties.
The emphasis here is to use scare-tactic arguments such as the issue of paedophilia, terrorism, drugs or arms trafficking.
These are issues which are very emotive.
People are very willing to allow legislation to be put in place and oppressive measures to be brought in because they are concerned about these issues.
The fact that I voted against does not mean to say that I am not concerned about these issues.
But first and foremost we must protect people's basic civil liberties as enshrined in international law.
We should not overlook that.
What kind of a society will we have if people's basic rights are overlooked in the combating of other crimes?
There are a lot of similarities between the two.
We have to remember that.
Nisticò Report (A5-0272/2001)
. (PT) There are controversial aspects to this report as there are, in fact, to the Commission' s own proposal.
As the rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market said, it would perhaps be preferable for the two directives, that is, the current proposal on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector and the directive on universal service, to merge.
Furthermore, the Commission proposal to give employers the right to monitor their employees is a complicated and very sensitive issue.
Equally, the bulk sending of unsolicited e-mails (so-called spamming), is another cause for concern, for which a satisfactory solution should be found.
This is why we should devote our full attention to the position of DECO, which endorses the Commission proposal, which in turn seeks to make prior opt­in consent compulsory for unsolicited emails, since this appears to be the best guarantee for European consumers' choice as to whether they receive spam mail or not.
This option thereby attempts to protect consumers from being bombarded with unsolicited electronic mails in the form of advertising, except when they have given their consent to receive such mail.
.
I voted for 'Opt Out'.
The opposite, an 'Opt-In' regime for Europe, would be entirely ineffective.
If the EU legislates to try to restrict the sending of emails, whether for marketing, or fundraising, or political messages, the emails will still be sent to receivers within the EU - but from outside the EU.
Indeed, I am tempted by the thought of setting up a little business in somewhere sunny like a Carribean island from where I would spray unlimited emails into the EU from EU businesses in return for a nice fat fee.
This business could not exist in the EU.
The well-meaning EU, if it chooses 'Opt In', will do two harmful things : it will handicap EU-based businesses against their worldwide competitors, and it will transfer jobs outside the EU.
The road to hell, they say, is paved with good intentions.
'Spam' needs to be controlled - but it can only be controlled by global legislation and cooperation.
I choose to vote against the position adopted by my political group when it comes to the rules about sending out unsolicited advertisements to consumers via e-mail.
E-mail advertisements are, in general, an inconvenience for the consumer since it takes time, for example, to open and delete them.
They also contribute to the spread of viruses on the Internet.
What is more, it is the consumer who has to bear the costs of receiving and reading the advertisements.
In the light of this, I consider that only an opt-in solution can effectively protect consumers from unsolicited advertisements.
My position on this issue has influenced my vote in the final vote on this report.
Ries Report (A5-0271/2001)
Schörling (Verts/ALE), in writing.
(SV) High brominated flame retardants are to be found high up in the food chain.
This is being seen for the first time now that a Swedish environmental study has shown that high brominated flame retardants, which were considered to be less dangerous than low brominated flame retardants, are also bioaccumulative, having been found in peregrine falcon eggs in Sweden.
The study shows that the content of brominated flame retardants in eggs from wild peregrine falcons is 400 times higher than that in eggs from falcons kept in cages.
We know that low brominated flame retardants are bioaccumulative now that they have been found in birds, fish and mammals, but it was previously believed that high brominated flame retardants were not especially dangerous.
High brominated flame retardants were thought to have larger molecules and thus to find it more difficult to penetrate the cell membranes of living organisms.
This has now proved not to be the case.
This is a major health and environmental problem because many users replaced the high brominated flame retardants in products with low brominated ones, and the use of low brominated flame retardants such as decaBDEs accounts for 80 per cent of all flame retardants.
The Group of the Greens therefore voted in favour of an immediate ban on the whole group of penta-, octa- and decaBDEs.
This is required by the precautionary principle, given the new discoveries that have been made.
A majority of Parliament chose to await the risk assessment that is at present under way in the case of decaBDEs.
This means that tons of dangerous high-risk chemicals continue to be released into the environment, something which in our view is contrary to the intentions of the precautionary principle.
Mr President, the Pensioners Party is totally in favour of regulating blood donation and the movement of blood.
Pensioners are very active in blood donor associations throughout Europe.
This excellent, spot-on, comprehensive report by my friend Mr Nisticò is therefore very welcome, and I have voted for it.
There is a saying in Italy, Mr President, that laughing makes for good blood, and we want the blood which is moving around the States to be good.
I therefore think it is a good thing that I sometimes go on with these explanations of vote to make people smile, because that makes for good blood and helps achieve the purpose of this directive.
The European Parliament has repeatedly turned its attention to the problem of testing blood for transfusions and blood donors and has passed a plethora of resolutions since 1993.
And there is still serious public concern as the result of criminal irresponsibility on the part of the relevant authorities in various countries of the European Union.
The aim of the Commission proposal to amend Directive 89/381/ÅEC is to improve both quality and safety in standards for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of blood and its various components.
More importantly, Member States can impose even stricter standards and blood moved between the 15 is not governed by the rules of the internal market.
I shall be voting for the Nisticò report because it is in favour of strict standards, it is against the commercialisation of human blood and because, for reasons of greater safety, it calls for security of supply via networks of volunteers in order to reverse the dependence of the European Union on non-Community suppliers.
.
(FR) We voted in favour of this text as it was following the modifications proposed by the European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
And we voted against all the amendments that could endanger or restrict the giving of blood on a voluntary and non profit-making basis.
We only regret that the report does not envisage a formal obligation for companies to grant their employees the necessary time in order to give blood and to remove the bureaucratic authorisation procedures that discourage those with good intentions.
We are opposed to the whole economic system that is driven by profit.
Profit made directly or indirectly from trade in human organs, cells or tissues, is one of the most despicable manifestations of this system, an expression of the fact that society has not come out of barbarism.
.
(FR) The European directive on quality and safety standards for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of blood should be modified in order to increase protection of donors and recipients.
The safety of recipients should be further guaranteed, both through the traceability of the whole transfusion network and by guaranteeing highly qualified staff in all blood transfusion establishments in Europe.
Greater safety increases confidence in the supply system, which, as a result, encourages donors to give blood.
This directive, however, should also highlight principles.
Blood is not a commodity.
Moreover, the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights states that it is forbidden to use the human body for profit.
This is why we need to clearly affirm the principle that the service should be free.
By donating blood, citizens are making an act of solidarity.
This means, as the European socialists have maintained, that blood components should only be taken from voluntary donors.
I cannot but vote in favour of the report by Giuseppe Nisticò.
This is because for a long time all sorts of people from all walks of life have been warning of the need for Community standards to establish definite rules in this sensitive sector of the collection, processing, storage and distribution of blood and its derivatives.
This is a sector where the extreme urgency of meeting great therapeutic needs must never be separated from considerations of control and prevention.
Mr Nisticò has set out the arguments extremely well, drawing on the strength of his professional expertise.
Those are the reasons, in short, that lead me to support the report in full and consequently to vote for it.
.
I, like many of my colleagues, have heard from blood donation organisations concerned by the possible modifications to existing legislation in this field.
Everyone agrees in deploring, quite rightly, the shortage of blood and plasma within the European Union while stressing the fact that under no circumstances should we relax our vigilance regarding the quality of these products, so much so that the European Union' s requirements are half covered by imports!
This directive, amended by Parliament, modifies, integrates and completes the legislation that currently governs quality and safety standards in Europe for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components.
It is about adopting stricter requirements regarding the admissibility of donors and practical screening of them, as well as putting in place a quality system at Community level in blood transfusion establishments.
This would all be completed by an equivalent testing and approval system in the Member States.
Finally, common standards would be defined for staff training and for the traceability of blood from donor to patient.
Of course, these measures will not prevent the Member States from maintaining or establishing stricter protection measures.
It is also desirable to reduce the European Union' s dependence on imports of blood or blood components from third countries.
In order to do that, information campaigns need to be aimed at potential donors.
But under no circumstances should we envisage a system of payment for these products.
The European Parliament report rightly stresses the importance of the voluntary nature of blood donation while accepting that the social contribution made by donors and the commendable nature of the donations that they make should be highlighted.
As a blood donor myself and a supporter of the cause of blood donation, I therefore voted in favour of this report.
I have been involved in the issue of blood donation for many years in the Italian Parliament, including setting up a parliamentary group belonging to AVIS, the principle Italian donor organisation.
Over the years the task has involved the passing of and subsequent amendments to what is known as the 'Law on blood' .
I formed the opinion then that increased European harmonisation of the sector' s rules is vital, not just because of European citizenship which compels us to take the same attitude in dealing with problems of human health in Europe, but also because common rules are indispensable when faced with serious illnesses - AIDS, BSE - and a worldwide market in blood which must also take account of scientific progress (artificial blood, human blood produced from stem cells)
Our amendments to the directive satisfy those, like me, who have always fought to strengthen public policy in favour of non-remunerated voluntary donation.
It might perhaps have been possible to do a little more, providing funds to promote initiatives in support of voluntary blood donation, but we are still taking a good step forward.
. (PT) It is important to state once again, as this report does, that the human body or its parts cannot be traded as commodities, and this includes human blood, of course, irrespective of the state it is in.
Various donor organisations, including the Portuguese Association for the Protection of Blood Users and the International Federation of Blood Donors support this position, including the various positive aspects of the report which signify progress on providing incentives to volunteer blood in the various Member States of the European Union.
A high number of donors is crucial to enabling each Member State to be self-sufficient, although the principle of solidarity must also apply between Member States, whenever necessary and whenever possible.
As stated in the report, if we want donors to give blood for free, which should be the case, the blood supply system cannot be commercial.
The processing of blood at all stages must be a service carried out for the Member States' health services for the benefit of patients.
All proposals that improve on the current Directive 89/381 are also positive, specifically in the areas of the levels of quality and safety in the various phases of collection, processing, storage and distribution of blood.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
I rejected the Evans report because I am not in favour of renationalising competition policy in Europe.
If the Commission gives up its monopoly on exemptions in the future, this will not reform competition law, it will merely change the system.
If the Commission then confines itself to supervising abuses within the context of this changed system, then that is something which, to my mind, is highly questionable.
If national courts in the European Union are allowed to return judgments under competition law in the future, we shall no longer, I think, be able to talk of a uniform competition policy in Europe, especially now that the European Union is preparing for enlargement.
What we need is a European Monopolies and Mergers Commission and I think that is what we should be working towards.
- (NL) The Evans report receives our support because the rapporteur has correctly indicated where the Commission proposal needs adjusting.
It is a step in the right direction.
For reasons of subsidiarity, I would certainly value a greater role for national competition authorities in the implementation of the competition rules.
However, it should not undermine the standard application of these.
That would not only lead to uncertainty for businesses, it would also lead to discrepancies in competitiveness between one Member State and another.
The national authorities need clear guidelines in order to rule out different interpretations.
It is too precarious at this stage to carve up responsibilities among different authorities.
The most appropriate authority could be the authority on whose territory the most important effects make themselves felt, but also the authority that has been monitoring the situation for a good while.
The rapporteur gets to the heart of the matter when he asks for the proposal to be further developed for the benefit of legal certainty.
Despite the demarcation of powers, the Commission is responsible for safeguarding standard application in the event of effects being felt from one State to another.
Set against the Commission' s authoritative powers, a strengthening of the rights of defence would be appropriate.
In this connection, the question arises as to whether the Commission could indicate how the companies' need for a prompt, EU-wide statement can be met.
The call for legal certainty is not only a matter of further development by the Commission.
The European Institute of Public Administration recently indicated that, in many cases, there is simply too little case law available to draw on.
It is therefore inherent in the current state of European competition law itself that major legal risks cannot be ruled out.
Before the proposed reform can take place, the Commission must lay a foundation in the form of guidelines, or legislation which safeguards legal certainty.
In this perspective, the concept of core tasks for the Commission and implementing tasks for the national authorities is worth further consideration.
Just and decentralised application will prove its worth, certainly following enlargement.
Andria Report (A5-0269/2001)
. (PT) This report examines the proposal for a regulation tabled by the Commission on the implementation of Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty with a view to creating a genuine common competition policy which is more uniformly implemented, and which will enable problems to be more effectively detected by abolishing the notification system in force today and in increasing the basic powers of the Commission, but also by decentralising power over policy implementation to independent national authorities, which would work in conjunction with the Commission.
Lest any doubts remain that the Commission is seeking to renationalise policy, it has tabled Article 3 of the regulation, which guarantees the primacy of Community law over national law, in other words, the implementation by national authorities and courts of Community law.
As a matter of fact, throughout the Commission proposal runs the blatant desire to increase its powers, as Article 7 shows clearly, which the European Parliament report, nevertheless, seeks to limit.
What remains, however, is this haste on the part of the Commission to reformulate competition policy before enlargement, thereby increasing both its powers of intervention and supranationality.
Since Parliament' s report seeks to establish benchmarks and curb the ambitions of the Commission, we have abstained from voting on it.
Mr President, Mr Andria, who is a great friend of Mr Fatuzzo and the Pensioners Party, has convinced me I should vote for his important report, which makes it possible to lend money to Member States of the European Union which do not use the single currency, the euro, to restore their balances of payments to health if they are in difficulties.
That will be of interest in a very short time - I hope - to all the countries that have asked to join the European Union, the twelve states which are to become members of the Union and which I hope will become members as soon as possible, but it occurs to me to say this to Mr Andria: 'Mr Andria, we are correcting the balances of European countries, but why can you not succeed in finding a system that allows pensioners to correct their own balances of payments?'
- (NL) On Tuesday, an extensive debate was held on the possible accession of twelve new Member States.
The economies of most of those states are weak in comparison with those of the current Member States.
It is not to be expected that these new Member States will swiftly change over to the euro as their own legal currency.
In those states, the euro can at best acquire the position of a second currency, additional to the national currency and involved in an ever-fluctuating exchange rate battle.
In those countries, the euro will at best be the currency for the rich and foreigners and have a role similar to that of the American dollar in many countries.
The result of the enlargement will therefore be that the number of Member States which are eligible for financial support for their balance of payments will rise sharply.
I am therefore not in favour of the simultaneous cut in the maximum level of loans to be allocated, from EUR 16 billion to EUR 12 billion.
The Commission has still not made a concrete proposal for the way in which the new Member States can participate.
I do, however, agree that responsibility for the management of the loaning mechanism should be transferred from the European Central Bank to the European Commission.
A responsible body is needed which can operate at a political level, and the bank is not that body.
Lannoye Report (A5-0217/2001)
Mr President, after the approval of Mr Lannoye' s report, which I have voted for with pleasure, my breakfast will never by the same.
At last we - I - finally have a European breakfast, a real European breakfast, because the sugar will be more European, there will be European honey, there will be European fruit juice, there will be European milk and, finally, the jam will taste European.
We could never have a sweeter Europe without this directive, presented by Mr Lannoye and voted for by me?
Thank you, Mr Lannoye, and thank you Europe!
Conference on climate change (RC B5-0539/2001)
Meijer (GUE/NGL), in writing.
(NL) The follow-up conference on climate change in Bonn produced two extremes.
On the one hand, those who say that the result obtained there was the best achievable under the present circumstances, are correct.
On the other hand, the result is worse than the worst-case scenario that was feared at the previous conference in The Hague in November 2000.
That conference was dominated by the fear that, for the sake of a worldwide agreement, concessions would be made to the US.
Among the EU Member States, the question was about the choice between two possibilities.
One was to stand firm in order to maintain the reductions agreed in Kyoto.
The other was to search for what might be just acceptable to the Americans, and to accept the required moderation as inevitable.
As an observer at this conference, I took the side of the steadfast German and French Green Environment Ministers in the debate at the plenary session on 29 November.
Since the refusal of the new American President to sign any agreement, the resistance against what was then feasible seems to have fallen by the wayside.
In order to keep Japan and Australia on board, more has now been paid than was demanded by America last year.
Bush is the winner.
In ten years' time, this inadequate agreement will be deemed a disgrace.
.
(FR) In the last few years, the news has highlighted food scandals and consumers are rightly demanding to be very well informed about the products that they buy.
The information given to consumers must be as clear as possible and as legible as possible, while avoiding increasing the number of categories.
Therefore, for fruit juices, the sales name should not lead to any confusion.
It is therefore essential to indicate to consumers the difference between a fresh fruit juice and a fruit juice made from concentrate.
These two different names will enable people buying them to choose a product with full knowledge of the facts.
In the same way, some fruit juices are produced by mixing fresh fruit juice and juice made from concentrate.
Just marking it as 'fresh fruit juice' would be deceiving consumers.
It is important that in this case labels should have an additional note indicating that the final product is also made from concentrate.
The name 'made with concentrate' or 'partially made with concentrate' should then feature directly under the name, in sufficiently large type to ensure that consumers are informed.
This measure also applies to nectars made from concentrate.
These decisions are aimed at informing consumers as clearly as possible, but also at not penalising producers.
The production processes for these two categories of products have technical, financial and organoleptic differences.
The production of fresh fruit juices requires high quality treatment of products, particularly during the pressing and pasteurisation phases, while the production of fruit juices from concentrate does not involve the same requirements.
Cederschiöld Report (A5-0284/2001)
. -(FR) Four years ago now, I spoke in this House on the vertical directive on honey, for which Mr Lannoye was also the rapporteur.
One of my main concerns in this case was, at the time, labelling.
I had tried to demonstrate that the label on a pot of honey should above all inform consumers about the origin and quality of that honey, in order to prevent honey imported from who knows where containing who knows what pollen from being confused with quality honey produced by our beekeepers.
Today, once again, we are talking about the quality of honey.
My aim is to draw your attention to the Commission' s proposal concerning the possibility of filtering the honey in order to remove the pollen from it, which I strongly condemn.
Pollen is the only indicator of the origin of honey.
Fortunately, the amendments proposed by our rapporteur prevent consumers from being misled, as they would no longer be able to know the origin of the honey and its exact composition if it were filtered to remove the pollen.
Without these amendments, there would therefore no longer be any guarantee of the quality of honey, and consumers would no longer be able to distinguish between quality honeys from their region as opposed to industrial honeys from abroad, which have been subjected to the filtering technique for a long time.
Moreover, honey could, according to the directive, contain 20% pollen 'A' and be 80% from 8 types of pollen.
On the label it would only say 'Honey from pollen A' as the English version of the directive propose, the term 'mainly' to describe the composition and the presence of pollens in honey.
This word 'mainly' indicates a majority, but not necessarily a majority of more than 50%. (N.B. the German translation 'überwiegend' and the French 'essentiellement' reflect that majority of more than 50%).
It then becomes possible to mix different sorts of nectar, without more than 50% of a nectar being present.
One could imagine a honey with 20% nectar A and the remaining 80% being made up of 8 different varieties of nectar.
(Speech cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
After more than five years in the pipeline, we have finally voted today on the proposal for a Council directive relating to fruit jams, jellies, marmalades and sweetened chestnut purée.
I am delighted that the Parliament has left the Council's exemption on biscuits intact, which means that British favourites, such as the jammy dodger, will not fall within the scope of the directive.
The jammy dodger is a fine British institution and many in the UK had feared that the directive would result in the outlawing of this biscuit.
It is good to see that not all of Britain's traditions and institutions are under threat from Brussels.
I abstained on the joint resolution on the Bonn conference on climate change.
It presents a much too enthusiastic assessment of the agreement negotiated.
It is difficult to believe that this agreement 'gives new impetus' to Kyoto, constitutes an 'essential instrument' for a 'world strategy against global warming ' and represents 'an extremely positive message for all citizens who are concerned about globalisation' .
It should in fact sound the alarm bell: nine years after Rio, no real measures have been put in place and the ambitions displayed by the Member States have been strangely diluted.
The Bonn agreement includes positive points, such as the refusal to present nuclear energy as 'clean energy' .
But it marks a new climb down in the face of supporters of the 'let the market decide' approach, which can only concern and not reassure 'citizens who are concerned about globalisation' .
The joint resolution is still quite ambiguous on this essential issue.
Paragraph 9 'regrets' the space given in Bonn to 'coal wells' and 'flexible systems '.
But paragraph 6 proposes that the 2003 conference on the climate should have these 'systems' as a theme (the international system of exchange of emission rights) rather than the essential public policies that are required to fight against climate chaos.
The simple fact that an agreement was reached in Bonn with Japan, Australia, Canada and Russia should not hide how far the content of that agreement is from responding to the urgency of the challenges.
Mr President, I am sorry I am having to speak so often, but I have heard that anti-Fatuzzo amendments to the Rules of Procedure have been tabled, intended to restrict explanations of vote at each voting time to three, so I am forced to take the opportunities I still have left for explanations in these last few days.
Now, I have voted for this Cederschiöld report because one of the worst dangers threatening us is computer crime.
However, I wonder why we do not pay consultants, the computer criminals, to draw the poison from the secrets of computer crime so that we could better combat this ugly habit which too many people in Europe have.
Bösch Report (A5-0280/2001)
Mr President, I am entirely in favour of the activities of the European Ombudsman and what he has been doing over the past few years, as set out in this report.
The truth is that many European citizens do not know their rights, do not know what they can do on the basis of European directives and, above all, think that European directives and regulations are not European.
They are convinced they are Italian laws, and I do not think that is a good thing.
I therefore propose to the European Ombudsman to insist, and this Parliament to accept my request, that European directives and regulations are called 'European laws' when incorporated into national legislation.
Almeida Garrett Report (A5-0240/2001)
Perry Report (A5-0245/2001)
Dehousse (PSE), in writing.
(FR) Mr Perry' s report marks the happy and constructive end to 15 months of calm and continuous work by the European Parliament.
It was on 11 April 2000 that the European Ombudsman, Mr Jacob Söderman, charged Parliament with the innovative project of a code of good administrative conduct applying to all the institutions and bodies of the European Community.
It is this code that has been approved this morning.
In order to achieve this result, with the practically unanimous assent of the European Parliament, several obstacles have had to be overcome.
First of all, like most legislative assemblies, we had to prevent a conflict of responsibilities between our different committees as, depending on the approach, four of them could be declared to be responsible for the whole of the proposal.
We succeeded in overcoming this risk.
Next we needed to find a sound and undisputed legal basis for adopting the code.
This is what the Legal Committee applied itself to doing, beyond the traditional disputes and opposition between the groups, and the more discrete but no less acute disputes between nationalities.
I am delighted to have been able to contribute to it through an opinion that was very open to the expression of this large constructive majority.
Today the European Parliament wished to both strengthen and simplify the rights of European citizens with regard to the Community' s administrative actions.
It has managed to do so as the code adopted contains significant new elements, the importance of which we will gradually discover.
Simplification, however, is just as important as it prevents an endless breakdown of all citizens' rights, rights which would actually lose their importance if they differed in every case.
I am happy to have been able to contribute through my vote in favour to this significant advance for European citizenship.
Mr President, I had a dream about Mr Söderman!
Yes, it was actually him!
We were having dinner, but it was not Mr Söderman as he is today, it was a young Mr Söderman, very young.
We were friends and we were chatting and he said to me: 'My dream, Mr Fatuzzo, is one day, when I am grown up, to become the European Ombudsman, because I want to be able to check up on what the European institutions do and, if there is any bureaucrat who is out of order, I want to be able to find that out and take action so that all the citizens of Europe have the chance to benefit from European laws' .
Well, Mr President, at last the dream that Mr Söderman had in my dream has actually come true with the approval of this directive.
Camisón Asensio Report (A5-0236/2001)
.
(FR) Although the text talks about 'deepening of democracy' and mentions 'emphasis on administrative openness and transparency' and despite its very aim which is to give the Ombudsman greater access to official documents, its whole spirit is marked by a concern to preserve the 'professional secrecy' of the information to which the Ombudsman may have access.
Rather than making the institutions and their operation more transparent, the function of the Ombudsman only serves to conceal the fact they are in no way transparent for the overwhelming majority of the population.
As a result, we did not vote in favour of the report.
And although we did not vote against it either, this is solely because the official French authorities are rising up against slightly more flexible access - solely for the Ombudsman! - to 'classified documents' , in the name of the Europe of defence and are calling for the report to be rejected.
We reaffirm our opposition both to commercial and industrial secrecy and to the so-called State secrets, which are not so much aimed at protecting the State against a third country as at concealing the actions, including the most disgraceful actions, of the State institutions from their own populations.
In today' s vote, I gave my support to a crucial strengthening of the European Ombudsman' s position.
The proposal is aimed at amending Article 3 of the Ombudsman' s statute so that the Ombudsman also has access to classified documents within the EU.
It is also proposed that all officials of the EU should be instructed to give full evidence in accordance with the truth and that their duty of loyalty towards their employer should cease.
Officials are thus obliged to defend the truth and their fellow citizens rather than to protect their own institutions. This is a crucial improvement in terms of transparency and democratic control in the EU.
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
Zimbabwe
We will start with the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
(B5-0549/2001) by Mr Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;
(B5-0554/2001) by the Members Mr Cox, Mr Mulder and Mr Haarder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;
(B5-0571/2001) by the Members Mrs Lucas and Mrs Maes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Zimbabwe;
(B5-0581/2001) by Mr Andrews, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the worsening of the situation in Zimbabwe;
(B5-0582/2001) by the Members Mr Van Orden and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;
(B5-0583/2001) by the Members Mr Bertinotti and Mr Herman Schmid, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;
(B5-0592/2001) by the Members Mrs Kinnock and Mr Van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe.
Mr President, it is truly unbelievable that the once so prosperous Zimbabwe, potentially Southern Africa' s breadbasket, has made such a rapid decline into economic and political chaos.
Behind the guise of 'land reforms' the so-called 'veterans' loot and occupy white-owned farms at will.
These bandits shrink from no form of violence.
The police stand by laughing at the brutal scenes of intimidation and even murder of honest citizens.
Thousands, mostly black agricultural labourers, are also robbed of their jobs and driven from their houses.
Despite the fact that the judiciary has branded these activities as illegal, the pillaging goes on undeterred.
In addition, the campaign of intimidation has now also turned against the judiciary itself.
Various independent senior judges have resigned as a result.
The ban on the publication of 'incorrect' news capable of causing panic and despair, is used with increasing frequency to muzzle the free press.
Opposition leader, Mr Morgan Tsvangirai, was indicted earlier this year for infringing the same law.
I should like to take this opportunity to second the proposal of Mr Van Orden to put forward this man' s name for the award of the Sakharov Prize.
The orchestrator of this state terrorism is the 77-year-old dictator Robert Mugabe.
He justifies his crimes with an appeal to a renewed liberation struggle, a fight against 'evil capitalism' and 'evil whites' .
His Vice-President, Mr Joseph Msika, takes things even one step further.
He recently declared that whites are not human beings.
No comment.
It is becoming clear that Mugabe' s excesses are causing him to lose all credibility as a national and regional leader.
Still, the isolationist President still has his own friends here and there.
At the Libyan festival of revolution last weekend, Mr Mugabe sat next to Colonel Khadaffi as the principal guest.
A few days before, his host, Mr Ghaddafi, had given him an oil loan of USD 360 million and a gift of USD one million for his election fund.
This crystal-clear joint resolution asks the Council and the Commission to take concrete steps against the criminal policy of the Mugabe regime.
No Member State should be allowed to shirk this.
Mr President, perhaps there are others in this House who, like me, paid regular visits to Zimbabwe in the early 1980s and were able to discover at that time the kind of country it was.
It was a land full of hope, the civil war was over and people wanted to embark on a new future.
The oppositions between white and black would cease to exist.
If we look at what has come of these plans twenty years on, we see chaos, poverty, possibly famine in prospect, no press freedom and certainly no democracy.
Of course, Europe cannot stand idly by, just as it could not in the past.
I think, however, that Europe, in particular, must encourage Africa to condemn Mr Mugabe, because if we are not careful that situation may spread to other countries in the region.
What are our options according to my group?
In the first place, we have to suspend aid.
Food aid will be a different matter.
If the reports are correct, Zimbabwe' s self-sufficiency may already be under serious threat, and this will certainly be the case in future.
If that happens, food aid will have to be given, but of course it must not be distributed via the government bodies, since we know what will happen to it in that case.
It must be distributed by independent organisations.
We should also like an investigation to be carried out into what kind of sanctions can be used against Mr Mugabe and his clan personally.
Can we take steps against possessions that they have in Europe, such as the freezing of bank accounts, etc?
Finally, I should like the Commission to investigate whether the rumour is true that people from Zimbabwe enabled to study at European schools and universities, are mainly selected from the circles of Mugabe and his henchmen.
Is that correct and does the Commission intend to do anything about it?
Mr President, Zimbabwe is a country that, some years ago, was a source of so much hope that it was felt that Africa and the post-apartheid regime in South Africa should look to Zimbabwe as the country that had succeeded.
The wretched fact is, of course, that Mr Mugabe has extended his term of power to an unreasonable length of time and has forgotten to settle the problem of land reform himself.
The way in which he is now tackling it beggars all belief and is bringing his country to the brink of collapse.
I am therefore very disappointed that Zimbabwe is still, despite the misery befalling the country, involved in the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
I am deeply disappointed that the land occupations that this country is subject to are throwing the whole economic system out of balance and that a country that is actually suitable for food production is now itself going hungry.
Much of the hope awakened by Zimbabwe has meanwhile been dashed.
Consequently I am disappointed by the attitude of the European Union, which is unable to adopt a coherent stand in respect of Zimbabwe and to take the necessary measures on Zimbabwe that are required to consign the government of Mr Mugabe to the past, and to give a chance to the hope for a new age.
Mr President, Parliament today will vote on its fifth resolution on Zimbabwe in the last 18 months.
If the Council and the Commission did not feel moved to act before, then it is certainly time to act now, before the Mugabe regime destroys all hope for what is potentially one of the most prosperous countries in Africa.
The breakdown in the rule of law, the terrible human rights abuses inflicted on all sections of the population in Zimbabwe and the catastrophic economic situation have all been well documented and have intensified.
The political opposition to Mugabe's regime has been in the frontline of attacks from Zanu-PF militants.
The opposition press has been bombed and critical journalists have been routinely attacked.
Opposition politicians in the movement for democratic change and their supporters have been the particular targets of harassment, violent intimidation, arbitrary imprisonment and murder.
In the last few weeks, many MPs and party officials have narrowly escaped death after violent attacks.
This is not some family squabble between Britain and Zimbabwe.
Mugabe's regime is a destabilising factor in central Africa and his human rights record is of international concern.
The economic collapse in Zimbabwe is pulling down neighbouring countries.
In the last two days, senior black opposition activists visiting this Parliament have insisted that the crisis is nothing to do with land, but about Mugabe's desire to hold on to power.
He faces defeat in the presidential election next year, but is trying to head this off with a savage campaign of brutal intimidation against his political opponents.
We must recognise that democratic norms, protection under the law and basic human rights have been abandoned in Zimbabwe for all elements of the population.
It takes enormous courage to stand up for democracy, liberty and freedom of speech in such circumstances.
Morgan Tsvangirai, as the leader of the opposition MDC since 1999, personifies this courageous stance and the struggle for genuine freedom in Zimbabwe and deserves international recognition for his stance.
I had rather hoped that we would have senior Council representatives here this afternoon.
This resolution is aimed at the Council in particular because there are a number of high-level meetings taking place in the next few weeks.
Can I have an assurance that today the secretariat will ensure that our resolution is passed to the Presidency, so that it can brought up at the informal meeting of ministers at Genval near Brussels this weekend and formally put on the agenda of the General Affairs Council on 8 October?
Mr President, after having plundered Zimbabwe during a century of colonial domination, after having exploited its working classes and despoiled its farmers of land, the United Kingdom has left a legacy of a situation in which the best land still belongs to a few thousand rich white farmers.
The major powers did not find fault with the dictatorial nature and the corruption of the regime in Zimbabwe until its dictator, Mr Mugabe, started, in order to preserve his power, to make a few demagogical gestures calling into question the privileges of the white farmers.
France, which is less associated with this category of privileged people, is meanwhile continuing to unscrupulously support the dictatorship.
The feigned indignation of all those who, here, are protesting against the violence of Mugabe' s regime, seems, in these circumstances, to be above all a hypocritical way of defending a handful of privileged people against the right to live of millions of farmers in that country.
Even though some occupations of land by groups of poor farmers are violent, that only represents a small fraction of the violence that was imposed on them in order to despoil them.
For our part, we express our protest against Mugabe' s regime, both against its dictatorial nature and its corruption, but also because that dictatorship continues to protect revolting social inequalities and the privileges of a limited section of society to which his clique and the rich white farmers belong.
We do not, however, associate ourselves with this joint resolution, of which we reject both the letter and the spirit.
It is up to the population of the country to settle its accounts with Mugabe and his dictatorship.
It is not up to those in collusion with the privileged minority and those who conducted or supported colonial violence to give morality lessons to that country.
We would also like to express our solidarity with the working population of Zimbabwe and our support for their right to take possession of all the land, without any repurchase or compensation.
Mr President, I must say to the last speaker that, as somebody British, I can confirm that my ancestors had absolutely nothing to do with the oppression or repression of the people of Zimbabwe.
I would like to make it clear that I and my family are in no way guilty of colluding with anything that took place in colonial days.
It is very important for us to recognise that this resolution is being debated here today at a very important time.
It is an opportunity for President Mugabe to make the decision once and for all to step back from the brink, as Mr Van Orden has clearly said.
In addition to the negotiations, which are taking place as we speak in Abuja between foreign ministers of the Commonwealth, there are a number of European Union initiatives including the intended visit to the southern African countries by the Belgian Foreign Minister, representing the Presidency and Mr Solana, the high representative.
There are a number of other things going on as well.
Very importantly, in about three weeks, the preparatory team will be going out to prepare for the European Union's involvement - hopefully - in the March presidential elections.
That makes it extremely important.
But if it turns out that all those initiatives fail and he still turns his back on the willingness of the international community to have dialogue with him, then it will be time to take stock of what is happening.
I would say to Mrs Maes in particular that one of the reasons the Council and the Commission have not wanted to take urgent action, as some in this Parliament would perhaps have wanted, is the danger that what Mugabe wants is an excuse to call a state of emergency in Zimbabwe so he can cancel the election, stop the democratic process and stifle the official opposition as well as any opposition from the press and media.
We need to understand the potential impact of anything that the European Union, or indeed the Commonwealth, does in order to tackle what is happening in Zimbabwe.
The defining moment will be on 8 October when the next General Affairs Council is due to take place.
If no progress has been made by this time, if the dialogue has failed, if we say this is a useless procedure, then at this point it is essential that we adopt so-called smart sanctions.
We should restrict visas to all Mugabe's associates and his government and identify those individuals with foreign bank accounts and freeze their assets.
Those are smart sanctions that will not hurt the poor people of Zimbabwe but would certainly hurt those Zimbabweans who very much like coming to London to shop in Harrods or visit their children who are in British public schools.
Those are the kind of important things that the European Union can do.
Similarly we will have to look at the possibility of the suspension of development aid because that is how the Cotonou Agreement would suggest that we should proceed.
At that time, we would have to express Parliament's view, as we say now, that insufficient progress has been made on land seizures, on political violence, on all of these things that others have raised.
Finally, I support the words of Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the Opposition Party, who this morning on the BBC was very tough on Mugabe and I will quote what he said and finish with this: 'President Mugabe has clearly violated all the tenets of the Commonwealth and all other international organisations and should now be isolated from the international community.'
We should heed the words of the leader of the opposition in Zimbabwe.
Mr President, in one minute you can say very little but I concur with what Mr van Orden, Mrs Kinnock and many of the other speakers have said.
I was in what was then Rhodesia in the 1960s and there was a great deal of injustice in that country at that time.
We had such great hopes for President Mugabe.
We thought we had in him a liberal, serious, intelligent leader.
Unfortunately, as we see the developing chaos and threats of famine and the destruction of the economy, we can but mourn the fact that he did not fulfil the hopes we had of him.
I agree that the smart sanctions are the way to go, because already the ordinary people of Zimbabwe are suffering grievously, as they watch their country disintegrate into chaos.
I urge all colleagues to support this resolution.
Mr President, there are 4 500 farmers of British, Dutch, German and Greek origin who own 8.3 million hectares of land in Zimbabwe.
Nine white farmers and 360 black farm workers have been killed in the chaos over the last few months.
Thousands of black farmers have lost their jobs and their homes and the farms are unworkable.
Zimbabwe depends on the success of agriculture and the contribution of these farmers is vital to sustain its economy.
There is money available from the United Kingdom government under the Lancaster House Agreement and there is a willingness among the white farmers to give up 80% of their land to settle the black families.
Mugabe must accept such a solution.
In 1970, Tanzania nationalised sisal farms, businesses and real estate, killing its private sector.
The same happened in Uganda in 1972, when the Asians were expelled, and those two countries' economies have been bankrupt ever since.
I sympathise with the farmers and farm workers of Zimbabwe, as my family was a victim of similar confiscation and nationalisation.
My family has lived in Tanzania for 166 years, much longer than many white farmers in Zimbabwe.
We bought land from Deutsch-Ostafrika in 1876 and I still have a title deed.
We lost land and property through nationalisation without compensation and I know what that means. I share the grief of the silent black majority in Zimbabwe, who continue to live in poverty.
The poorest in Zimbabwe do not want to shoot, kill, loot and burn crops.
They are hungry and unemployed.
They need food, education, health, employment and shelter.
It was the vision and quality like Nelson Mandela that at last set an example for Africa that reconciliation, cooperation, democracy and respect for all people, irrespective of their colour, is the only way to govern a developing country the only way to help the poorest to be free of poverty and disease.
President Mugabe must follow Mr Mandela and accept reconciliation and democracy, allow the white farmers to thrive and continue farming and accept that Zimbabwe belongs to the people of Zimbabwe and nobody has the right to deprive them of a decent life based on peace and democracy.
Mr President, the Council, Commission and Parliament are well aware of the situation in Zimbabwe.
No one can claim they knew nothing about it.
In taking a passive line, the Council of Ministers is guilty of aiding and abetting.
It is outrageous that, yet again, the Council's 'Africa' working party failed to pass a resolution at its meeting in Brussels yesterday.
Obviously the presidency is only paying lip service to Africa, despite advertising it as a priority.
Unfortunately, France is the ringleader of a group of Member States that obviously has a different agenda.
How else are we to explain the fact that, while everyone else is either stopping or drastically cutting back on funding, France is increasing it.
I call on the Member States of the European Union who want to take a more active line to step up their collaboration, even before the Treaty of Nice takes effect, and to remind France and the rest that they are surely backing the wrong horse in taking this de facto passive line.
I think, my dear Mrs Kinnock, that Mr Mugabe will have no need of our resolutions or demands if he decides to impose a state of emergency.
He will do so anyway because, even if the elections are held, he will lose.
Mr President, I was part of the observer mission that went to Zimbabwe, as was Mr Gahler and others here.
I want to explode the myth that this is about land and land ownership: This is about politics.
This is about the fact that Mugabe knows that if they had the same votes that were cast last year in the general election, he would lose a presidential election.
He is driving the farmers and their farm workers off the land, out of the constituencies, so that they cannot register to vote.
It is plainly about politics.
It is not about colonial powers.
It is about politics.
Those farms are well run, they provide churches, schools and hospital treatment in those areas.
The communities come together.
70% of Zimbabwe is about agriculture and the economy is being destroyed.
We need smart sanctions to be taken on President Mugabe.
He is not listening to placations.
We have got to act and we have got to act now.
As the Members who have just spoken have pointed out, Zimbabwe is clearly in the grip of a serious crisis, which could lead to economic collapse and political conflict in extreme social conditions, bordering on a humanitarian emergency.
Our analysis is the same as that which most of you have made: the sole objective of the Zimbabwean government is to stay in power, even if that means ending up destroying a country that not long ago was considered to be one of the soundest economies and democracies in Africa.
The Zimbabwean government, which could have reasonably avoided this crisis, is therefore clearly responsible for this dramatic descent into hell.
The European Union' s political objective, as many of you have pointed out, is that presidential elections should be held.
The Union' s main objective is presidential elections in 2002, in the best possible conditions to enable change, as we say in conventional language.
The Union' s position, if that is the objective, should therefore be to seek a balance between, on the one hand, indicating our disagreement with the current development of the situation and, on the other hand, preventing it from serving as a pretext for declaring martial law, which would have the effect of delaying the elections that we want to take place.
Therefore, observing the presidential elections in 2002 is, in our view, the absolute priority for the Union.
With regard to what was said in your speeches on the implementation of Article 8, that is political dialogue (Article 8 of Cotonou), we approve the pursuit of political dialogue, while stressing, like you, that no substantial progress has been made in this dialogue in recent months.
A small hope remains, which is the forthcoming visit by the presidency to the countries involved in the Congolese crisis, an event that could perhaps lead to this dialogue being revived.
As far as the following stage is concerned, which is the implementation of Article 96 of Cotonou, which we call consultation and adoption of appropriate measures, again in conventional language, the Council will look at this issue at the beginning of October with, of course, our participation, and we will decide then whether or not we will take this step.
With regard to the impact of this situation on development cooperation, we hope to be able to maintain the programmes that the Community funds in Zimbabwe, particularly in the health and education sectors, given the humanitarian and social nature of these programmes, in order not to penalise the population, which is already being heavily affected by the economic crisis.
All this is taking place, as you have all said, in an extremely worrying economic and social context.
In Zimbabwe this year we see that a cereal shortage has already occurred and that should be manageable if it was only a question of the cereal shortage and its consequences for the population.
However, the serious instability prevailing in the country, the economic crisis and the societal conflicts that are taking place there are an important factor in a situation of food insecurity that we think, in these conditions, is in danger of becoming worse.
It is therefore the interaction between the food situation, the agricultural shortages, in this case of cereals, the economic context and the political context, which contains the germs of a crisis that is probably even more serious than that which we are currently experiencing, and which we should do everything we can to avoid.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Foot-and-mouth disease
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
(B5-0548/2001) by Mr van Dam, on behalf of the EDD Group, on foot-and-mouth disease;
(B5-0553/2001) by Mr Martinez and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on foot-and-mouth disease;
(B5-0555/2001) by Mr Mulder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on foot-and-mouth disease;
(B5-0563/2001) by Mr Goepel, Mr Sturdy and Mr Maat, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on foot-and-mouth disease;
(B5-0573/2001) by Mrs Lucas and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on foot-and-mouth disease;
(B5-0580/2001) by Mr Berlato and Mr Hyland, on behalf of the UEN Group, on foot-and-mouth disease;
(B5-0584/2001) by Mr Jové Peres and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on foot-and-mouth disease;
(B5-0593/2001) by Mr Garot and Mr Adam, on behalf of the PSE Group, on foot-and-mouth disease.
Mr President, the regions of Oene, Kootwijkerbroek, Mayenne, Cumbria and Northumberland have become notorious in Europe.
Regions where humans and animals have suffered from the foot-and-mouth epidemic.
However, the suffering was caused not only by the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, but also by the means of combating the disease imposed by EU regulations, namely the slaughter of all animals on infected farms and in a buffer zone around them.
An approach based solely on the preservation of distant export markets. Odd, if we realise that the European Union actually imports meat from vaccinated cattle from Argentina.
Much of the suffering of the last few months would have been unnecessary if the Commission had been prepared to accept preventive vaccination.
In France and since June also in the Netherlands the crisis has been averted. Unfortunately, that is not yet the case in the United Kingdom.
There the suffering of farmers and animals continues unabated.
The figures make our heads spin.
Since 9 a.m. this morning, there have been 2 005 new cases.
Twenty recent new cases in Northumberland that for three months had seen no new infections.
In the United Kingdom, four million animals have been destroyed in connection with foot-and-mouth disease and a further one-and-a-half million because of welfare problems related to the crisis. Let me be clear about this.
This is not a loss of production units. This is the destruction of living creatures.
It surprises me that the British government is only now considering using vaccination.
The argument that they wish to retain the lucrative export markets no longer cuts any ice, now that winter is nearly upon us.
Under the present circumstances, the United Kingdom will have lost that market for a considerable time.
I sincerely hope that the British government will listen to Sir William Stewart of the British Association of Science who says that vaccination must play a part in combating foot-and-mouth disease and should have been used at a much earlier stage.
There is intensive contact with continental Europe through the many movements of people, animals, vehicles and lorries. That makes the situation in the United Kingdom life-threatening for agriculture in Europe.
The present checks, including those at the Dutch border, are so minimal that they are asking for trouble.
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to take adequate preventive steps to prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth disease in continental Europe, so that humans and animals are spared unnecessary suffering.
Finally, I appeal urgently to the Commission once again in the light of the unmanageable crisis in the United Kingdom to change the non-vaccination policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, in this outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, there are technical areas of shadow, political certainties and strategic questions.
First of all regarding the areas of shadow, how, far from the known endemic sources - Turkey, Asia and Thrace in Europe - how has foot-and-mouth disease, and its virus, managed to reach Great Britain, an island?
Perhaps by swimming?
Why this dogmatic refusal of a vaccine that is nevertheless effective.
In 1950, before the obligatory vaccination between 1961 and 1991, France had up to 300 000 sources of infection per year, which disappeared with the obligatory vaccination.
Why, in the same country, have we had the foot-and-mouth virus and the prion for mad cow disease?
So many questions that lead to political certainties, if not lessons.
In both cases, BSE and foot-and-mouth disease, the British authorities have reacted late and have been overwhelmed, because the ultra liberalism of the Thatcher years left only 220 vets compared with 8 000 in France.
Just as for a developing country, Australia, Canada and even the French army had to send vets to Great Britain.
A lack of vets and no epidemic monitoring, which is why the disease spread.
It was also ultra liberalism that led to abattoirs being closed and meant that, from Carlisle, Hadrian' s Wall and Northumberland, sheep are taken to the south and the virus is spread.
The virus is spread across Great Britain and, following the removal of borders, it is also spread across France.
Freedom of movement is freedom of contamination.
The third certainty, demonstrated in an investigation report from the French Parliament in June 2001: it was illegal purchases, at knock-down prices - less than 90 euros per sheep for the Muslim feast of Eid-el-Kabir - which led to the spread of the virus.
Along with these certainties, however, there are questions for the Commission; and it is good that it should be Mr Lamy, the strategist, who is here.
First of all, does the compensation system in Great Britain not end up becoming a bonus for contamination?
The impression was given that the beneficial compensation meant that people perhaps had an interest in having contaminated animals.
All the more so given that, collectively, four million animals were slaughtered, the majority of which were sheep, means that the surpluses will be drained.
And finally, does New Zealand, the leading world exporter, not have an interest in seeing its potential market share in Europe increase as animals are slaughtered?
And my God, if Anglo-Saxons were able to come to an understanding on the Echelon Treaty, they can exchange favours.
For me, Great Britain, excessive individual compensation, for you, New Zealand, the possibility of more exports.
The Cairns group would be happy.
Doha would be a success.
It would be good if Mr Lamy could clarify this for us.
Mr President, no crisis in Europe, and especially in the Netherlands, has had such an impact on public opinion as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.
The great question is, and I do not know whether the Commission can answer it: what is the Commission' s explanation for the continued outbreaks of foot-and-mouth in the United Kingdom?
In my view, it is not only a matter for the authorities in Great Britain itself.
After all, every European taxpayer contributes to the solution of the crisis.
Has the Commission urged Britain for example to use ring vaccination?
I should have thought that the example in the Netherlands was very successful, and why could it not be repeated in other European countries?
Another question. One of the reasons for the crisis is that meat was imported illegally into Europe.
Controls on our outer borders were inadequate.
My question to the Commission is: what has been done since on the outer borders?
What has changed from, let us say, some six months ago?
Why not implement a similar type of check as in the United States or in Australia, where there are strict controls on entry?
I have not been able to find this anywhere in Europe.
A further question. I believe that the large-scale slaughter of animals will no longer be acceptable to public opinion in the long run.
The development of marker vaccines might be one of the solutions.
The Commission has already done something about this, but will it do a little more to ensure that these marker vaccines and also the accompanying testing methods are made available as quickly as possible, so that we no longer have to slaughter so many animals?
Finally I should like to know something about the costs.
The situation in Great Britain is special, since the whole question of rebate is taken into consideration, but how much does the Commission estimate that this has cost up to now?
Mr President, the British countryside is at the moment in total crisis.
I have a document here in front of me stating that the British government admits that it was unable to meet the required deadlines for the slaughter of infected animals.
It goes on to say that the control of the disease, as my colleague there has said, has failed because we are now having new outbreaks in the centre of Britain, in the centre of the region where we thought we were rid of it.
We have failed to control it and we have also failed to provide the necessary border controls.
Last Sunday I drove from my farm in North Yorkshire to Strasbourg.
I was never questioned about whether I was carrying any meat and there were no border controls at all to check my vehicle.
There were no disinfection points.
There was a simple carpet in the middle of the road and that was all.
I say to Mr Lamy, who is the really important man here today, that we have a situation where England is the dustbin of Europe.
We are importing food from these countries.
We must look at that.
Finally, will he consider the possibility of a public inquiry into the way this matter has been handled?
Mr President, I very much regret that this is the second time in six months that we are having to debate foot-and-mouth disease in this House.
The reason for our debate is, as the Joint Resolution says, that the measures taken by the UK government to control this disease have failed, that new outbreaks are appearing and that there is a very real risk of the disease spreading again to mainland Europe.
We need to ask ourselves why the UK government has failed and why in particular it consistently rejects the idea of ring vaccination in the face of mounting calls from those in rural communities who want to adopt it.
It is ever more clear that it is not small farmers' livelihoods, it is not even the tourist industry and the wider rural economy that the UK has as its priority, but simply our meat exports and the desire to regain FMD-free export status again as soon as possible.
Yet even this dismal economic justification for culling on such a scale does not stand up.
According to the National Farmers' Union the UK earns just GBP 630 million a year from meat and dairy exports.
Compare that with the estimated cost to the wider rural community of GBP 9 billion as a result of the foot-and-mouth epidemic.
I welcome the call in this resolution for a full cost-benefit analysis between the various disease control approaches so that we can compare the losses that have been suffered under the culling approach to those that would have been incurred under a vaccination strategy.
I feel sure that the results will demonstrate that the UK government' s approach is not only inhumane, it is also uneconomical.
We are urging the Commission to revise the EU strategy on defending by all means FMD status and to recognise that the culling and destruction of healthy animals is both inhumane and ineffective.
Mr President, I represent the region in the north-east of England which was the scene of the original outbreak and has just recently been affected by further outbreaks.
I regret very much that we have been unable to agree a compromise text on this occasion.
The reason is simple.
Recital A accuses the UK government of failure to control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.
In truth, it is not an attack on the UK government but on all those who have battled very heroically against the disease since the end of February - the farmers themselves, the vets, the scientists, the civil servants, the police, the military, many different rural agencies which have all been involved.
In particular, the farmers in the Allendale Valley, the scene of the recent hotspot, believed that they had taken all the necessary measures to avoid the disease.
Failure to control implies that the outbreak should have already ended.
But the mover of the resolution did not explain when and by what means that might have been achieved.
No-one ever promised, or even surmised, that the outbreak would be over at this stage.
At its peak there were 40 to 50 cases a day.
Despite the recent outbreak in Allendale, the average is now two or three cases per day.
If this does not indicate a degree of control then we really have a very serious problem in front of us, something that none of us ever imagined.
It is important also to recall that from the very start the UK government has given full information to the other Member States and has followed the advice of the Standing Veterinary Committee.
In that respect, we can point to a considerable success for the mechanisms that we have operating within the European Union.
A word on vaccination.
I would suggest to Mr van Dam, the original speaker on this resolution, that perhaps he ought to apply for the job of chief scientist in the United Kingdom.
He certainly seems to bring to the debate on vaccination an authority and conviction which far exceeds that of the current holder of the office, Professor David King, who only this morning in a radio broadcast said we could not be certain that vaccination would have done any good.
In the Netherlands the animals were also slaughtered and there is quite a problem here in the suggestion that vaccination actually saves the animal's life.
That does not necessarily follow - but I do not know when the job becomes vacant!
Mr President, Mr Adam calls the approach of the British government a great success.
But the great success of the tackling of foot-and-mouth disease by the British government is causing many farmers in continental Europe sleepless nights once again.
Is that a successful policy?
Foot-and-mouth policy there is not only inadequate, because we do not use, for example, vaccination and ring vaccination but because the Council and members of Council are treating the threat from Great Britain extremely lightly.
After all, it is extremely simple to lay disinfectant mats and carry out standard soil checks in ports and airports in order to clamp down on the problem.
We emphatically appeal to the Commission and the Council on this point.
Mr President, in my country, financial subsidies to farmers are cut back drastically if they have made minor mistakes and have had foot-and-mouth disease.
At the same time, however, many Ministers have no reason to talk, because they are doing nothing to avert the danger of foot-and-mouth disease from Great Britain in border checks.
This is a very nasty business, which the Commission and Council must tackle.
Mr President, no one doubts the seriousness of the foot-and-mouth epidemic in the UK.
I believe it has been the worst epidemic of this disease that the world has seen.
Nobody can doubt the drastic measures that have had to be used to curtail it.
The two current hotspots show that this outbreak will be with us for many months.
We cannot, on the one hand, say that the containment is too drastic because of the slaughter policy and, on the other hand, that it is too slack because it has let the disease take hold.
We did not anticipate effectively the extraordinary scale of animal movements, particularly of sheep, in February 2000 and later.
The first of the three inquiries that have now been launched in the UK will need to look at that and perhaps also at the role of one form of CAP subsidy in encouraging some of these forms of animal movement.
We provided effective information for our Dutch, French and Irish neighbours and for them it worked.
We should study how their containment worked and why.
Vaccination, in my opinion, has to be one of the options that the inquiry can recommend if they so find.
Finally a word to Mr Sturdy, who called for a European public inquiry.
When we had one into BSE, he was not so enthusiastic.
But BSE was a new disease.
There was a real element of concealment in some of the factors that led to that disease and particularly in the European factor and the fact that we were still exporting infected meal to continental Europe for years after we banned it for ourselves.
That was a genuine European inquiry.
The epidemiology of this outbreak is not in doubt.
I believe that our friends should accept that the British have to get their own house in order and, if that means a public dimension to the inquiries, that case can be made in the UK.
It is not like what happened with BSE: we have done our duty by our neighbours.
We hope that they will now have the confidence in us to let us help ourselves and see all remedies properly examined so that this dreadful disease can be exterminated.
Mr President, neither BSE nor foot-and-mouth are British diseases; they are a European problem.
With millions of animals being slaughtered and farms being crippled or wiped out, this is hardly the time for party political argument.
I well remember how Labour let fly at the Conservative government during the BSE crisis and now there is the temptation for the Conservatives to let fly at the Labour government, but even if governments are guilty of omission, what you are doing here is not exactly constructive.
We have submitted a regulation on feeding meat and bonemeal in certain cases - we are talking animal waste here.
Had we had it at the time, there would have been no BSE problem.
The same applies to foot-and-mouth.
The Commission needs to change its strategy.
Holland may have ring vaccinated successfully, but it was only by going against the mood in the EU and the Commission.
I do not want you to help, I want you to do something so that we end up with a different strategy which we can then also secure through our trade policy.
We must move away from this insane strategy of 'foot-and-mouth free' or 'disease free' and discuss this with our trading partners.
We need a regulation on feeding or destroying leftovers.
What the Council has done now, that is, just banning, is no help at all.
This rubbish has to go somewhere and we cannot dump it in landfills because then the problem of improper processing will keep recurring.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
The number of cases of foot-and-mouth is on the rise once again.
As you know, the foot-and-mouth virus is harmless to man but is highly infectious to all cloven-hoofed animals and results in huge financial losses.
With new outbreaks occurring, I again call on the Commission and the Council to favour vaccination rather than slaughter.
We must rethink how we fight zoonoses in Europe and today we have what I think is a very balanced resolution in order to do so.
Consistent preventive hygiene is only one side of the coin.
With people travelling the world for business and pleasure, foot-and-mouth disease is an ever-present threat and we must be far more consistent in applying controls at airports to prevent this epidemic from coming in and spreading.
I realise that both farmers and consumers are having difficulties with the ethical implications of the current vaccination policy.
We are talking fatal consequences here.
We must, at long last, move away from our non-vaccination policy.
We need marker vaccines.
We need a reasonable approach to ring vaccination and we need to make up our minds once and for all to show through our policy that science needs to make progress with prevention, that is, by formulating suitable vaccines.
To give a brief description of the current situation in the Union as a whole, no restrictions have been imposed in the Union as a result of foot-and-mouth disease, except in Great Britain, and that was on 25 June this year, thirty days after the slaughter and destruction of the last vaccinated animal in the Netherlands.
So in fourteen of the fifteen Member States of the Union, plus Northern Ireland, we have quite a favourable situation, which is the result of the implementation and effective application of measures to combat foot-and-mouth disease at Community level.
I shall now run the risk of offending Mrs Lucas by referring briefly to the international point of view, and from that point of view we sincerely hope that the measures which have been adopted by France, Ireland and the Netherlands will enable them to obtain the necessary status from the International Office of Epizootics, thus enabling third countries to lift the trade restrictions that are still in place.
However - and on this point I should like to reassure Mrs Lucas - since this is perhaps not the most important aspect, let us come back to the case of the United Kingdom, which is actually still giving cause for concern, since the two-thousandth case occurred on 3 September.
Although the situation in Great Britain has remained stable for almost three months, we are still worried about it because of the fact that cases are continuing to occur within or close to the areas that have been placed under restrictions.
Many Members have referred to the most recent cases, in the county of Northumberland, the place where the epidemic first appeared.
These cases are worrying, because they were confirmed three months after the disease had disappeared there.
Radical measures were taken: infected herds were slaughtered, as were neighbouring herds and contact herds, and although the occurrence of this admittedly limited but nonetheless worrying number of cases was to be expected, after the disease peaked at the beginning of April, the period over which a small number of cases have continued to occur is excessively long, and the Community has asked the British authorities to step up their eradication measures.
Time is pressing, because things will become more difficult in autumn and winter, not only because of weather conditions, but also because it is customary for animals to be moved during that period.
The present development of the disease is clearly passing through a critical phase.
This is not the time to relax our controls.
As has already been said, and as several of you have emphasised, this is the time of year when we see herds being moved around and handled in various ways, and in our opinion it is therefore necessary to reduce animal movements to the absolute minimum.
The Commission has made this known to the people involved.
Staying with the United Kingdom, the complex structure of beef and dairy farming, the absence of any clinical signs in sheep, and the fact that the spread of the disease within a herd or flock is slow, are all factors which complicate the problems and which make it necessary for us to have recourse to laboratory testing, and the capacity available for such testing is now sufficient.
So what is the Commission' s opinion?
We would not say that the situation is satisfactory, because in this specific case it is not, but the risk of the disease spreading to other Member States is now much less than it was in March and April, when the disease was at its peak, because all the restrictions that were imposed, in particular on the movement of animals and untreated products from Great Britain, are still in place.
We are carrying out regular on-the-spot inspections, the latest of which goes back to the end of August, in order to satisfy ourselves that the British authorities are taking adequate measures.
Other regions of Great Britain, in some cases quite large regions, have not been affected by the disease, and the Veterinary Committee must continue to consider the matter so that when the time comes, and circumstances make it possible, trade with those regions can be envisaged subject to stringent conditions.
On this point we shall be extremely careful, because the experience of Northumberland reminds us that the risk is still present, even in those areas where it seemed that the disease had been brought under control.
To come back for a moment to the question of third countries, if Mrs Lucas will allow me, a certain number of countries have continued to take discriminatory measures against European products, which go beyond the international standards currently in force, and we are working on this matter together with a certain number of our trading partners.
Many third countries have gradually lifted the somewhat extensive prohibitions that they had initially imposed.
Others, by contrast, such as the United States, Canada and even some of the countries which have applied for accession, have been slow to lift the restrictions, which they still maintain, wrongly, even today.
We shall continue to work on this question, taking as our basis the WTO Agreement on Health and Plant Health.
Speaking more generally, it should be emphasised, first of all, that this crisis has had major repercussions on the Community budget.
We decided to grant an overall budget of EUR 400 million to the four Member States affected this year, and the latest forecasts show that the Union' s anticipated financial contribution will be slightly more than EUR 1.5 billion.
We shall take the necessary measures from the point of view of budgetary procedure.
There is no doubt that this is an exceptional situation.
We do not know how to predict the budget for epizootics on this scale, and we shall therefore have to make adjustments as we go along.
That is just one aspect of this issue.
A second aspect, of course, is the damage done to the image of our livestock farming industry, following the slaughter of almost four million animals.
A third aspect is the fact that the problem, as has already been mentioned, is also present outside the European Union, and we are seriously worried following the recent appearance of a case in Turkish Thrace.
Finally, we at the Commission hope that we shall be able to learn some lessons for future use, with regard to the handling of this sort of crisis, so that we can improve our current regulatory and legislative system, for example by making provision for a certain number of additional requirements for intra-Community trade in small ruminants, such as restricting the number of stopping points, which would probably be the first step.
We are also working on a proposal regarding the identification and registration of sheep and goats, and on another proposal regarding the importing of animal products by travellers.
We are also working towards adjusting our inspection procedures when this type of epizootic appears.
I believe that we now have sufficient experience, but we must not delude ourselves.
The reinforcement of our legislation and of our systems, however necessary it may be, will not, on its own, be enough to prevent the reappearance of such an epidemic.
We must also improve the operation of the veterinary services within Member States, and there is not doubt that we must also change our farming practices.
My last point is one that several Members have drawn attention to during our discussions, and that is the question of vaccination.
As far as the use of so-called 'ring' vaccination around infected holdings is concerned, I should like to remind those of you who have sought to implicate the Commission by asking why the Commission did not order compulsory vaccination as a matter of urgency, that in our present legal system, which whatever any one says is characterised by certain forms of subsidiarity, vaccination is the responsibility of the national authorities.
There is therefore a procedure which allows any Member State that wants to to use vaccination, and that is how it is done.
The system exists and it is at the disposal of the Member States, but it is not the Commission' s responsibility.
I believe that I have thus given a clear answer to the questions raised by Mr van Dam, Mr Martinez, Mr Mulder and Mrs Lucas.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.

Republic of Mauritania
Mr President, the abolition, in October 2000, of the main opposition party in Mauritania, the Union of Democratic Forces-New Era, and the arrest and subsequent sentencing, to five years' imprisonment after a summary judgment, of the leader of the Popular Front, Chbih Melainine, calls into question the fundamental principles of democracy laid down in the constitution of Mauritania.
What, then, is that constitution worth?
There is no freedom of association for political parties.
The Green Party, which submitted its articles of association several months ago, has still not been recognised and has not even received an acknowledgement that its application has been received.
These anti-democratic manoeuvres are taking place on the eve of the legislative and local elections planned for October.
We have no guarantee regarding these elections, because there is no independent electoral commission.
In our opinion, the release of Chbih Melainine is a prerequisite for holding the elections in October, as is the reconstitution of all the opposition parties.
It is in order to allow all these political actors to participate that we are asking that the elections should be postponed.
In order to re-establish democracy and guarantee the organisation of free and fair elections in Mauritania, we are asking the Council and the Commission to enter into consultations with the government, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
Mauritania is preparing thoroughly for the elections in October.
Political opponents of the regime are being neutralised.
People are being arbitrarily arrested, excessive force is being used against peaceful demonstrators and the press now serves only as the president' s lackey.
The judiciary is again entirely at the disposal of those with political power.
Their Honours recently sentenced the principal political opponents of the president in a show trial to no less than five years in prison.
The imprisoned politicians were kept incommunicado for a long period and then taken to prison 800 km from the capital, so that they can receive almost no visitors.
It appears that no one can do anything to stop this.
Independent human rights organisations can scarcely operate in the country.
While Western countries are obliged to apologise in Durban for the slave trade conducted by their distant ancestors, slavery is still common practice in Mauritania.
In the caste system, people become serfs at birth.
They receive no education; no income from forced labour and are not allowed to marry without the permission of their master.
According to an estimate by the American State Department a few years ago, there are still some 90 000 slaves in Mauritania.
As recently as 1983, this country was the last on earth to abolish slavery officially, but still does its utmost to keep the gruesome reality hidden from the outside world.
It is high time that the European Union opened the consultative procedure of Article 96 with Mauritania.
We cannot continue giving aid and maintaining intensive trade relations as if there were no problem.
We must prepare for pseudo-elections in a pseudo-democracy.
Mr President, Mauritania is a vast country and almost 90% of its land is desert.
Water is a scarce resource and its 2.2 million people are poor and live in rural areas.
It depends on its exports of iron ore and fishing - just two things.
I was invited in May of this year to lead a small delegation of MEPs and visit Mauritania, which I did.
I spent a week with parliamentarians, all the ministers, President Taya, civil society and NGOs.
We travelled up and down the country - a week is a long time to be in Mauritania.
Mrs Sudre and Mrs Langenhagen came with me.
I was impressed by what President Taya has done over the years in a country as poor as this.
I am astonished - and I want to embarrass him and his government, which I shall do at the ACP Conference when their delegates come - that there is now this sad case of locking up the opposition.
There is no reason for it, there is no need.
He is quite strong, he is quite popular.
He has done well.
He can do well without locking up his opposition.
As far as slavery is concerned, it is actually banned in Islam and Mauritania is a Muslim country.
There are Moors, there are blacks and various mixtures of these two.
I saw their lifestyle.
I did not see any slaves, though that is not to say they are not there.
What I shall certainly do is embarrass the government of Mauritania at the ACP Conference to make sure this practice does not continue and the opposition is allowed to operate freely so that there is accountability of the ministers.
It is better for the president of the country and the people of the country.
Mr President, the situation in Mauritania is actually getting worse and worse.
We are talking about a country that falls within the ACP framework in relation to the European Union and which, furthermore, hopes to move on from its current observer status to becoming a full member of the Barcelona process.
We are obliged to remind the Mauritanian authorities that it is impossible for the European Union to envisage, for example, that country acquiring full member status in the Barcelona process if democracy does not become a reality, if human rights continue to be violated and, what is more, if the date is maintained for the municipal and legislative elections which, as things stand at the moment, will take place this October without any type of guarantee.
There is clearly little chance of dissolved parties and imprisoned opposition leaders being able to participate when, furthermore, they have nowhere to express themselves because the press is either overseen by the government or simply does not exist.
I shudder to think about the situation of that one Member of Parliament who does not belong to the government party in an assembly of 79 seats, but I imagine that if any opposition Member were elected in these elections - which will not happen - he would probably soon be sent from Parliament to jail.
I therefore think that the European Union must implement the provisions of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
Mauritania lowers the already low average level of democracy and human rights in the Maghreb.
However, it is clearly just one more case on a continent such as Africa, where human rights are constantly violated.
Mauritania is a country where the permanent dictator, not the dictator of the moment, President Mauya Uld Sid'Ahmed Taya, has just torn up all the rules which, with the mediation of the European Union, the opposition and the government had established for proper elections, elections furthermore which have been delayed indefinitely.
I believe that the Union must act decisively.
Togo
Mr President, two years ago, my first speech to this House condemned the situation in Togo.
Since then, although some good souls have assured us that everything is working out nicely, Togo is still living in a political wasteland and it has a long way to go before it escapes from it.
Democracy is still a fleeting ideal.
Civil rights and human rights are constantly flouted, and I believe that the passive attitude of the governments of European Union Member States does nothing to encourage things to change.
Parliament' s regular condemnations are merely rhetorical and ineffective.
Most recently, the sum paid by the Commission to organise new elections - CFA francs 4 billion - was dismissed as insufficient by the government, which took advantage of the opportunity to postpone, yet again, the long-awaited legislative elections.
In a complete violation of his previous undertakings, President Eyadema and his government are even thinking about amending the constitution so as to allow him stand for election again.
Finally, one of the opposition leaders, Mr Yawovi Agboyibo, was arrested and sentenced, a month ago, on trumped-up charges.
The truth of the matter is that he had denounced the terror tactics employed in areas where the opposition had a majority, tactics which took the form of rapes and other crimes, including the murder of opponents.
Mr Eyadema seems less than ever prepared to honour his obligations to his people and his obligations to the international community.
Here again, Parliament should firmly condemn his actions, demand that free elections be held on the planned dates, and ask the Council and the Commission to initiate consultations in accordance with Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
How do you stay in power for 34 years in Africa?
Opposition parties are banned or it is made impossible for them to function.
Opponents who have or threaten to acquire support are put behind bars.
The press is completely manipulated and anyone openly criticising the president winds up in a cell if he is lucky and six feet under if he is less fortunate.
Mass demonstrations are mercilessly broken up.
The political class consists entirely of slavish servants of the president as a result of a system of rewards and punishments.
A ludicrous cult of personality is designed to give the Head of State a quasi-divine status.
The French President, Mr Chirac, has to be hoodwinked to such an extent that he condemns Amnesty International instead of the human rights violations in Togo.
The murdering of opponents of the regime goes unpunished.
This is still unfortunately the familiar pattern in many African countries and we do not really know how to deal with it.
Crude misuse of power hampers development and perpetuates poverty.
The European Union quite rightly suspended aid as long ago as 1993, but the situation has not improved.
On the contrary, the opposition leader and human rights campaigner, Mr Agboyibo, was thrown into jail for six months, for allegedly insulting the Prime Minister.
In order to add force to his arguments his Excellency maintains a private army of 1 000 troops.
Togo is asking for financial support to hold parliamentary elections in October.
The question is whether or not we would then contribute to the organisation of a democratic farce, designed solely to give those in power a semblance of legitimacy.
President Eyadema has announced that he will keep to the constitution and step down in 2003, but why should we believe someone who has lied for 34 years in order to stay in power?
Mr President, Zimbabwe, Mauritania, Togo, it looks very much as if the democratisation process in Africa is in reverse.
Some leaders are indeed proving exceptionally creative in eliminating their political opponents and getting round the democratic rules of the game.
One of them is General Eyadema from Togo.
At the last elections in 1998 he did not hesitate to have the counting of votes stopped and himself again proclaimed president.
A period of bloody repression followed, in which, according to Amnesty, hundreds of people were killed.
An international committee confirmed those findings, but at the present moment, no one has yet been called to account or punished.
On the contrary, the repression is simply continuing. The latest victim is opposition leader, Mr Agboyibo.
Last month in a show trial, he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for spreading false information.
I have met Yawovi Agboyibo several times personally in his home base. I have developed a very great admiration for the way in which, at the constant risk of his own life, he continues to campaign for human rights and the restoration of democracy in his country.
This must be stopped in some way.
Maintaining the suspension of aid is one thing, but I believe that we must ask ourselves whether a country like Togo still belongs at conferences of the ACS and the European Union.
However, the problem is that, just as in the case of Zimbabwe, certain European states follow their own agenda for the sake of commercial or other interests and, in so doing, run counter to the European strategy towards Togo.
It is not enough to establish fine principles in an agreement.
They must also be applied consistently and that also applies to a country like France.
Mr President, the resolution calls for the release of Yawovi Agboyibo, the opponent of the dictator, General Eyadema.
We support this resolution in that respect, but we wish to make it clear that those who approve the policies of the great Western powers are not in a position to be indignant now, because this dictatorship, which has oppressed the people of Togo since 1967, could not have persisted without the support of the great powers, and particularly of France.
One might therefore question the usefulness of a resolution adopted by Parliament, when the present dictator is then welcomed with as an honoured guest of our governments, and when he continues to receive subsidies that allow him to buy the arms that keep him in power.
Cambodia
Mr President, Commissioner, it is clear that the political situation in Kampuchea is calmer at this moment than it has ever been and it is equally clear that the country is still a long way from being a real democracy.
Much support is still required on the slow road to democracy, and the local elections will be an extremely important moment in that process.
The Kampuchean People' s Party, which controls the country, is an old-style Communist party, which means that it as a party is directly or indirectly involved in everything, in every sector, at every level in that country.
Consequently, it is not surprising that the local elections should be considered a threat and that they have been repeatedly postponed.
It is therefore essential that we continue to exert international pressure on the government to do everything possible to create a violence-free period before the elections and to reopen the procedure for voter registration.
Voter registration is in the hands of the village headmen, who are appointed by the central committee of the Kampuchean People' s Party, and nothing is simpler than to give poll cards to those in favour of the government and withhold them from those opposed to it.
Only last Monday, the leader of the opposition, the Member of Parliament, Sam Rainsy, had a meeting with the local representative of the European Commission, who in that conversation, was able to make the point that we have a very positive attitude to the National Election Committee.
I am far from being so enthusiastic.
We must watch that National Election Committee very closely, since it is at the crux of whether or not the elections are being conducted fairly.
The European Union has little cause to be proud of the way in which we observed the elections in Kampuchea last time, and we must do a lot better this time.

Mr President, Cambodia has been through a black period, a bloody period, a period in which nearly three million people were sacrificed to Marxist ideology.
During this period, there were two people who personified the hope for freedom, Son San, the important democrat, who often visited us here in Strasbourg and who has since died, and King Sihanouk, who is now an old, ill man.
That is why this country needs to be renewed from the roots upwards and young, democratic forces need to be supported.
This can only be done through the communes, it can only be done through democratic local elections from the roots upwards.
That is why it is so important for us to support and back the numerous candidates in the communes, for us to ensure that fair local elections are held, for us to monitor efficiently, for us to ward off, prevent and correct any jiggery-pokery during registration.
As for the Criminal Tribunal, we must state quite clearly that this is not a question of revenge, it is a question of law.
We must state quite clearly to future offenders that acts of violence, genocide and mass murder will be ruthlessly punished on the basis of the rule of law, irrespective of who is responsible.
That is why we need the International Tribunal to have a large Cambodian contingent, so that it is seen not as a foreign court but as a court of the Cambodian people.
Mr President, in our memories Kampuchea will always remain the country of the 'Killing Fields' .
The period of terror still casts a shadow over the country.
Even now, with elections in prospect, the democratic process turns out not to be proceeding completely smoothly.
On the contrary, restrictions have been imposed on the opposition.
There is increasing violence.
Voter registration has been halted, so that 30% of the electorate cannot even take part in the elections.
There is the lack of legal guarantees in the special tribunal, and so on. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge for the European Union, or the democratic world, to do our utmost to keep watch and to help guide the country towards democracy.
It would surely be positive if at least one guarantee could be given.
Something concrete, namely that voter registration will be reopened, so that the hope of a democratic result is not completely dashed in advance.
Afghan refugees seeking asylum in Australia
Mr President, the crisis concerning the boat full of Afghan refugees off Australia again calls attention to the whole problem of Afghan refugees.
In the last 20 years, millions of people have fled Afghanistan and, according to the UN human rights organisation, approximately 6.2 million Afghans are classified as refugees.
Their first port of call when they leave the country is generally one of the refugee camps in Pakistan and Iran, where they live in appalling conditions.
Pakistan can no longer cope with the number of refugees and is sending them back to Afghanistan.
Outside the refugee camps, there are so-called travel agents waiting who send refugees with money on to other countries, and the cheapest fare to a Western country is now a journey to Australia, which costs approximately EUR 6 000.

This stream of refugees will not stop if we do not manage to receive the refugees properly near Afghanistan and that is what we as the European Union must put our money into.
This is the solution to the problem.
As long as people are living there in dreadful conditions, they will want to go on fleeing to Western countries.
Ladies and gentlemen, the fate of the Afghan refugees on their desperate quest for a chance of a new life provides a predominantly depressing story, were it not for the actions of the captain of the Norwegian ship Tampa.
Not only did he rescue the people from a sinking ship, but subsequently too he consistently took the side of the people.
It is thanks to such humanitarian help that we can retain a vague hope in a better future.
For this reason, our group feels that a legal obligation should be introduced to allow the stowaways ashore at the first port of call, in agreement with the 1957 Treaty on stowaways.
As a result of the clash between the various spheres of law, the refugees become the exhausted pawns in a game of passing the buck.
Consequently, it must be clearly stated that Australia' s actions in this matter have been far from praiseworthy.
Local political interests have taken precedence over the respecting of human rights.
Through its actions, Australia supports and finances the source of the problems with which the country is confronted.
Too little attention is paid to the cause.
The main responsibility for this drama lies with the Taliban regime, which is systematically destroying its own country and killing the spirit of its own population, so that migrations of people have become a necessary evil.
In this matter, we have an international political humanitarian responsibility. We might have wished that Australia would use its political weight to condemn the regime in Afghanistan and to spur the international community on to constructive action.
Mr President, I think any of us can understand why people should flee Afghanistan.
Not only because of the repressive and fanatical nature of a regime which denies women and children education, work and even medical care, but also because of the deterioration of the economic situation which that fanatical regime is causing in the country.
We therefore perfectly understand the almost 500 people which tried to flee, at risk of their lives, and came up against a brick wall erected by a country such as Australia, a rich country which could have taken them in from the outset without any problem.
I believe that we should acknowledge the courage of the captain of the Norwegian freighter, Arne Rinnan, who, without thinking of the consequences and led only by humanitarian considerations, immediately picked up these people, who were in danger of drowning.
In contrast, we must strongly criticise a country which, like any of our countries, is obliged to take in a ship which was sailing in it waters with almost 500 people in a situation as precarious as that of these refugees.
Rules must be laid down to prevent this type of situation.
I know that it is not easy, that there are increasing numbers of refugees, that poverty is spreading and is the reason why many people are seeking a better life, but I believe that the attitude of Australia must not be imitated by any country towards any group of refugees who, under the protection of the United Nations Convention of 1951, are asking to be allowed to survive.
Mr President, we were negotiating the motion for a resolution on Afghan refugees when, at precisely that time, a Turkish ship approached Greek waters and threw 350 people into the sea.
215 of them have been picked up and more than a hundred are still being sought, and we do not know if they have drowned or if they have been able to survive.
In fact, a former European Commissioner and Member of this Parliament, the current Greek Minister for the Merchant Navy, Christos Papoutzis, has highlighted the irresponsibility of the Turkish government in allowing a situation such as this to come about.
As the Member who has just spoken has said, we are undergoing a universal process of globalisation.
The phenomenon of illegal immigration is not confined to one part of the world.
The European Union, to be specific, is currently seeing the arrival of huge numbers of immigrants, and since Commissioner Lamy is here, and he has been so concerned with the problems of globalisation, I would like to say that I believe we are dealing with another aspect of the phenomenon of that globalisation.
Just as capital and goods are being moved about freely, it seems that people also want to move about freely.
As Mrs González Álvarez has said, this is not an issue which is easily resolved, but I believe we could do something from here on many levels.
On the most general level there would be a regulation of the international economy that includes population movements.
And on more specific levels it would mean action by the institutions of the European Union to try to regulate this illegal immigration.
This very week, this summer, on the island where I live, we have seen the bodies of illegal immigrants who have been flung from the boats on which they were arriving by Moroccan skippers who form genuine mafias.
The question should be put to the Commission of what measures the European Union is preparing for action within its own territory and what measures it is proposing on an international level.
I believe that we must act in our own territory, and in the area of neighbouring countries, such as Turkey and Morocco, which are sending us illegal immigrants, and on an international level, by establishing regulations of a general nature.
I do not believe that responsibility on the issue of the Afghan refugees should fall exclusively to Australia.
Responsibility also falls, for example, to the Indonesian government because it was from there that the original boat sailed, the crew was Indonesian, it all began in waters under Indonesian jurisdiction and it seems that nobody is remembering to state this type of responsibility at the moment.
I believe that international action is required in this case and I believe that this would be an excellent opportunity for the European Commission to implement an initiative, I repeat, not only in the closer area of our neighbours, but also on an international level, with a view to achieving the regulation of migratory flows and illegal immigration.
Mr President, in August the Norwegian freighter Tampa rescued 433 Afghans and four Indonesian crew members from a fishing vessel that had set sail from an Indonesian port.
The captain was given permission to proceed to the Indonesian port of Merak, after which he was put under duress by the passengers with threatened suicides and forced to sail towards Australian waters.
It is believed that many of these passengers set out from a refugee camp in Pakistan, paying about GBP 4 500 each to be taken illegally to Australia.
Apparently the going rate for Germany is GBP 7 000 and Britain, the destiny of choice, is GBP 10 000.
The Australian government was perfectly entitled to exercise its sovereign right under the law of the sea to secure its borders by refusing the ship access to Australian waters.
Nor do its obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention apply until an asylum seeker is actually present on its territory.
The convention itself, introduced before the age of cheap mass jet travel, was a response to the horrors of Nazism and designed to protect the principle of asylum.
However, as we are all aware, it is increasingly abused by economic migrants who pass through several safe but poor countries in order to reach rich countries to settle in, where it can lead to people-trafficking, prostitution and a black economy in jobs.
In Britain over 100 000 people claimed asylum last year and the great majority of these claims were unfounded.
But it remains profitable for criminal people-traffickers to ply their trade because appeals can be strung out for years and, even when unsuccessful, almost no-one is deported back to their country of origin.
Australia's problem is also our problem.
We need urgently to face up to the need to secure our borders and remove those who enter illegally.
There is widespread concern.
The EU should urgently develop new policies in this area.
We also need to exert severe pressure on those countries which refuse to take back their own nationals.
In fact we need to totally renegotiate the 1951 Geneva Convention and think again.
I salute Prime Minister Howard of Australia's robust and courageous stance over this issue.
Mr President, the European Parliament is calling upon the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to facilitate the activities of voluntary organisations when it comes to supplying food and urgent humanitarian aid to the Afghan people.
Why are thousands of people fleeing in droves from Afghanistan?
What kind of regime is it that is governing the country?
The Christian aid organisation, Shelter Now International has just recently been excluded from Afghanistan and forced to discontinue its activities.
Eight of its employees - including four from an EU country, Germany, two from the United States and two from Australia - have this week been put on trial in Kabul for alleged Christian missionary activity.
The prosecutor is demanding the death penalty.
Sixteen Afghans are also being put on trial in accordance with the same Muslim law and threatened with the death penalty for having converted people from Islam to Christianity.
Mr Patten, Mr Michel and also Mr Solana are acting to protect these people.
Mr President, may I begin by saying that I cannot agree with anyone who suggests that the claims of most of the people who have been processed in the system in the United Kingdom are found to be fraudulent.
I would like to distance myself from statements like that.
It misrepresents the position of people in Britain who do not understand the kind of attitude that we heard here earlier this afternoon.
We are glad that after eight days of sitting under tarpaulins in the hot sun and inside containers, the Afghan refugees are now at least in reasonable conditions on board the ship on a long voyage to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea.
It has been an extremely tragic incident and terrible to watch and to think of their suffering.
But more than anything it teaches us that the 50-year old asylum-seeking system instigated by the United Nations is not working any more.
It is creaking under the strain of the mass movement of 21 million migrants a year.
The desperation of the people on the Tampa is clear.
To suggest that people take this kind of action lightly is ridiculous.
They take terrible risks with their lives and the lives of their children in order to escape persecution or penury.
They cross the seas in inflatable boats, they cling to the underside of trains like the Eurostar and jumbo jets.
The suffering of the refugees on the Tampa should at least lead all the governments that we represent here to rethink the way that they implement the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees.
Finally, I would say that the first thing we have to try and do is to ensure that it is governments, rather than organised criminals, that determine where refugees finally end up.
Attack on a train in Angola
Mr President, the attack on a train, which caused the death of 260 civilians and injured more than 150 people on 10 August in Angola is unacceptable and deplorable, especially since, in the weeks that followed, several buses also came under fatal attack.
Once again, it was UNITA which struck the blow, thereby continuing to violate the peace agreement signed in Lusaka in 1994, which made provision, amongst other things, for the disarming of the militant rebels.
Unfortunately, these acts of terrorism are merely one further stage in the civil war that has been ravaging the country for more than 25 years. Above all, however, these extremely violent acts against civilians only serve to postpone even further the prospect of organising the elections planned by the government for 2002-2003.
When he announced, on 23 August, his intention not to stand in the presidential elections, President dos Santos threw the ball back into the rebels' court.
He says that he is prepared to hold free and democratic elections, provided that the war comes to an end.
The pause in the fighting and the restoration of a peaceful climate are due, according to him, to Mr Savimbi and his militant movement.
Yet Mr Savimbi, the leader of UNITA, says that he wants to negotiate.
In reality, of course, sitting comfortably on his diamonds, he wants only one thing: all the power.
We are also responsible here, because who is it who supplies UNITA with arms?
Who is it who participates in this diamond trafficking?
As for the government, it is not transparent either.
The lack of transparency in the management of petroleum revenue leads us to conclude that public funds have been used to back up the regime.
The Angolagate scandal has revealed the role of Europeans in this affair.
The violence has to stop, and dialogue must be initiated as a matter of urgency.
Angolans must vote for and achieve peace.
The European Union can make its influence felt, and it has a role to play here.
It should be reminded of that fact, and we must vote in favour of this resolution in order to go forward.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again, in this Parliament, we are discussing Angola.
News comes through on a regular basis and is always sad.
The latest report describes an attack on three passenger vehicles in southern Kwanza last Sunday, in which dozens of people were killed.
No one has yet claimed responsibility for this attack.
Previous to this, there had been the attack on the train we are condemning today, which caused the deaths of more than two hundred people and for which UNITA claimed responsibility.
Lives have been wasted and innocent blood has been spilled in a bout of violence that we can only condemn.
We condemn UNITA today with the same independence with which, in February, we condemned the MPLA and the Angolan government for persecuting journalists.
More important, however, than condemning those who stubbornly continue to wage war, and criticising both sides, which undoubtedly deserve our criticism for pursuing this path of confrontation, the most important and most useful thing may be to foster peace.
This Parliament can contribute to encouraging all those in Angola tired of war and wanting a better future.
Along with many other Members of this House, specifically Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I signed a proposal to award the Sakharov prize to Zacarias Kamuenho, Archbishop of Huambo and Chairman of the Episcopal Conference of Angola and São Tomé.
I urge all of you to use this gesture as a means to give courage to all those in Angola who wish to see peace prevail.
Mr President, the appalling terrorist attacks that Mr Savimbi' s UNITA has been carrying out in Angola, first in Caxito, then on a train, and then on cars, schools and hospitals, warrant our sternest condemnation, because they mainly affect the civilian population.
These are some of the most violent and reprehensible terrorist acts in living memory.
I therefore feel that the European Parliament too must express its repudiation of such acts in the most forceful terms, as the rest of the international community and, in particular, the other Community institutions have done by unequivocally condemning such barbarity.
All the same, and if any doubts could possibly remain, these acts have brutally shown the correct nature of the positions that have been successively adopted by the international community which, with a single voice, has called for and is implementing the isolation of UNITA and the imposition of sanctions on it.
That organisation had already given sufficient proof of being largely responsible for the tragic situation affecting Angola and its people, through its rejection of election results, obstructing the disarming of its forces and, more generally, through waging war and not respecting and even blocking the implementation of agreements that they themselves have signed.
Now, however, with such acts of vandalism, UNITA is revealing its true colours even more clearly and there is no longer room for any doubt, however small, as to the nature and the objectives of this organisation.
This is why there are even fewer grounds for holding equivocal positions, particularly where the European Parliament is concerned.
Any positions or initiatives, particularly when formulated by friends of UNITA such as Mr Ribeiro and Castro, which tend to condone, exonerate or divert attention from the huge responsibilities of UNITA in the tragic situation that Angola is experiencing are completely unacceptable. This applies also, and especially, to those that tend to place the legitimate government of Angola on an equal footing with this type of terrorist organisation.
As a matter of fact, it is now clearer than ever that any path to peace in Angola requires holding UNITA responsible, ensuring its political and diplomatic isolation, ending the diamond trade that sustains it and disarming it for good.
Having said this, I should just like to say a few words about the motion for a resolution that we shall be voting on next.
Its approval, despite the odd provision that is not worthy of adoption and is not essential, would be a positive development in that it would enable the European Parliament to adopt its traditional position of aligning itself with the international community and with the other Community institutions on this matter.
In particular, I would like to emphasise the correctness of the decision adopted by the resolution to call the acts that UNITA has recently been perpetrating 'terrorist' acts.
This is the right word to describe them and all concomitant conclusions should be drawn from that.
Mr President, I wish to respond to a personal remark which I consider to be unacceptable and, in this context, insulting.
I fully and vehemently repudiate this disgraceful insinuation, and furthermore the quite shameful and unbecoming statement from the benches of the Communist Party, which is more responsible than anyone for the war in Angola, that I am a friend of UNITA.
I wish to state quite categorically that I vehemently condemn the attacks on civilians but I understand the situation in Angola. I do not do favours for the diamond dealers or the oilmen or for Angola' s corrupt administration, which is largely responsible for what is happening and for the suffering of the Angolan people.
Mr Miranda should be ashamed of what he says and what he does, particularly because he is chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation and should be making a more responsible contribution to promoting a cease-fire and dialogue, which is what the Angolan people are asking us to do.
Mr President, allow me to take up the various points which have been mentioned during this debate, and to let you know the Commission' s position.
On the subject of Mauritania, first of all, we share the concerns that have been expressed regarding respect for human rights in Mauritania.
In recent years we have observed some progress.
This has now come to an end, and we are experiencing a period of sudden backward steps.
Like the Members who have spoken during the debate, we believe that the Union cannot remain silent in the face of the imprisonment of the leader of the opposition, Mr Chbih, in the conditions that we are aware of and in particular in the period leading up to the elections.
Therefore we, like you, believe that steps should be taken to ask for the release of Mr Chbih while the result of his appeal to the court of cassation is awaited, at the same time using this opportunity to remind the authorities of the principles to which the Union is committed with regard to the electoral process.
The release of Mr Chbih and the holding of the elections this coming October are our two priorities.
On the subject of Togo, again we share your concern, both about the imprisonment of a local journalist in May and about the imprisonment of the two leaders of the opposition parties, Mr Olympio in June, and Mr Agboyibo just recently.
All these names and all these facts have been mentioned, in particular by Mr Rod. We should like to follow up our approach to the Togolese Minister for Foreign Affairs on 17 August, when once again we expressed our concerns to the Togolese government.
At the time, I believe that we got a clear message across, to the effect that, from the point of view of the Union, the political parties and the media must be able to continue their activities without restrictions.
So far, our approach has not had any effect.
We believe that the statement made in August by the Prime Minister, in which he mentioned the need to postpone the elections and proposed that the electoral code should be amended, which some Members have mentioned, is not good news and does not help to create a climate which is conducive to the conducting of transparent, free and democratic elections.
On this subject we have noted with satisfaction the statement made by President Eyadema, in which he said that on this point the Prime Minister' s proposals committed only the Prime Minister himself, whereas he, the President, intended to respect the constitution and abide by the undertakings given under the Lomé Convention.
We are continuing to monitor the political and economic situation and we shall maintain our position, to the effect that we can render assistance to the electoral process by helping the government to create the necessary conditions, notwithstanding the suspension of our cooperation with Togo which, as you know, was decided on under the provisions of the Lomé Convention, which corresponds to what would now be Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
From this point of view, Mr Rod, we are already past the Article 96 stage.
The Union has also responded positively to the invitation from the Togolese Minister for Foreign Affairs to participate in a mission to observe the elections.
If the United Nations decided to take on the task of coordinating such an observer mission, we would not have any objections.
However, the conditions for organising and implementing such an observer mission still have to be determined.
If it is decided to go ahead with such a mission, obviously Parliament' s participation in that mission would be welcome.
As for human rights in Cambodia, the Commission and the Member States have been officially invited by Cambodia to nominate and dispatch observers to monitor the local elections.
With this in mind, we have sent a fact-finding mission.
The conclusions and recommendations of that mission will be examined by the Council during September, so as to decide whether or not we should organise a Community observer mission to monitor the local elections.
We are also ready to assist in the smooth running of those elections by means of technical assistance projects.
On the question of electoral registration, Mrs Maes, the latest figures available to us indicate that the overall rate of registration is just over 80%, which is an improvement on the previous figures, though 100% registration has still not been achieved.
As for the question of how we should deal with the past, which some of you have mentioned, I would remind you that we support without reservation the efforts of the United Nations and of the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia to reach an agreement concerning the court responsible for the Khmer Rouge trials.
On the subject of the Afghan refugees seeking asylum in Australia, we, like Mrs Kinnock, are relieved that a solution has been found which will provide the help and protection needed by those people, men, women and children, who are fleeing from one of the most intolerant of all regimes.
If I have understood you correctly, your speeches were not intended to put any particular third country in the dock, but rather to consider whether, in the context of the present system of international governance, there are any remedies that would enable us to handle this type of situation better.
You are right, we cannot remain insensitive.
We all know that there are other ships carrying other fugitives from misery, often in the most appalling conditions, and that these ships arrive, some of them off the coasts of Europe.
This is not a question of 'the rest of the world' , from which we can remain detached, any more it is a question of looking at it purely in the light of the problems that it may give rise to elsewhere.
There is clearly a growing malaise in the international community with regard to forced migration, whether it is of economic, political or criminal origin, because this is how we must describe the organised networks trafficking in human beings.
Mr Medina Ortega, we share the desire which you and other Members have expressed for international instruments to be adopted which will be able to prevent and settle such cases, and also your desire at least to update and amend the 1951 Convention so that it can cope with the present situation, which is not the same as it was in the 1950s.
From this point of view, we support the efforts initiated by the High Commissioner for Refugees, which were announced on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of that Convention.
The High Commissioner for Refugees played an important role in dealing with the crisis involving the Tampa, and I believe that we should all encourage the Commissioner to put this type of problem on the agenda of the consultations which, following the Geneva Conference in December, should enable us to update our rules, because that is what they are, international rules.
We must also remember the importance of the protocols on trafficking in human beings which are annexed to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime of December 2000.
The Community is itself a party to those protocols which, when they come into force, after a certain number of ratifications, will improve the joint framework that we have at our disposal in order to combat such crime.
As far as the Union itself is concerned, and we really are concerned, as I have said, the Treaty of Amsterdam and the conclusions of the Tampere European Council provided the basis for a common policy on asylum and immigration.
I believe that the Union, by means of these instruments and various declarations, has repeated its commitment and that of its Member States to a humanitarian tradition which should take the form of the creation of a common asylum regime which provides appropriate protection to any person who needs it, and which guarantees the principle of not turning people away.
Of course, this will not work without preventive measures in the countries and regions of origin.
We took a step in the right direction here when the Council adopted a certain number of action plans prepared by the immigration and asylum group.
One of these plans is specifically targeted at Afghanistan and neighbouring regions.
If it proves to be ineffective, we shall have to look at it again, and we shall rely on Parliament to point us in that direction.
As far as trafficking in human beings is concerned, we need to strengthen the action taken by the Union, especially in cases where the victims are able to benefit from international protection.
Here too, the Commission takes the view that a more systematic and coherent approach is needed.
We shall shortly be taking action with a view to achieving this, by issuing a communication.
This is all turning into a timetable of action for the Union.
Work has started within the Council.
To be perfectly honest, we think that things are proceeding very slowly, but this is only to be expected given the sensitive nature of these issues from the point of view of Member States.
No doubt we shall need fresh impetus at an appropriately high political level, probably at the European Council in Laeken.
At any rate, that is what the Presidency seems to think.
It goes without saying that Parliament' s support in this matter will, we are sure, enable us to proceed in the right direction.
Finally, on the subject of the attack on a train in Angola, there is not much that I can add.
Much of what has been said we can all agree on anyway.
Like you, the Commission is very concerned about the continuation of this war, and deplores the fact that these confrontations are intensifying and that, yet again, several hundred civilians have been killed in various regions of the country over the last few weeks.
We are absolutely determined to support the efforts being taken, in accordance with the Union' s common position, to find a political solution to the conflict in Angola.
I did not get the impression, from your speeches, that you are seriously critical of that common position.
We are therefore working towards implementing it, by supporting any proposal which seeks to support the initiatives being made by the African Union - and there are some - or by African regional organisations such as the Southern Africa Development Community, with a view to developing the systems which have been set up on the initiative of African countries in order to prevent and resolve conflicts.
I would remind you that we are continuing our humanitarian aid to Angola, which is substantial, and that we are consequently ready to adjust the nature and the scale of that humanitarian aid.
Mr President, I was not present at the debate because I was attending the Conference of Presidents, but someone came to tell me that a member of my group, Mr Miranda, was literally the subject of verbal aggression on the part of another Member.
I regard such methods as inadmissible.
It was more than a personal accusation, and that is why, Mr President, I should like you to allow Mr Miranda to take the floor, and to ensure that his restatement is included in the minutes.
Mr Wurtz, you were not present.
First of all, it was Mr Miranda who attacked the other Member and I allowed the other Member to speak briefly in order to reply.
That is the end of the matter because if Mr Miranda says something else and Mr Ribeiro e Castro says something else, we may very well be here all day.
Both gentlemen had the chance to speak on the same subject and the final score is therefore 1 all!
Exactly, Mr President, this is a point of order.
I think that you must have not been paying attention, Mr President, when you said, just now, that I was the first to attack Mr Ribeiro e Castro.
This is not true.
In his own speech, which preceded mine, Mr Ribeiro e Castro referred to me in a completely unacceptable way and you said nothing about it, Mr President.
As you will remember, he said that I have manipulated public opinion, that I have manipulated the press, that I have sought to use this Parliament, and he referred specifically to the fact that I am Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
What I said in my speech that gave Mr Ribeiro e Castro the pretext for answering in the way he did was simply that some friends of UNITA, specifically Mr Ribeiro e Castro, had gone ahead with certain initiatives.
Mr President, I did not mean any insult by this, because it is public knowledge and widely known that this party, to which Mr Ribeiro e Castro belongs, has clear, public and acknowledged links with UNITA.
This was the precise tenor of what I said and nothing more!
That is why what was said...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, I should like to say on a point of order that the President took absolutely the right line because Mr Ribeiro e Castro did not stand up for UNITA; on the contrary, he signed a motion criticising it.
He criticised it in his speech and the President allowed him to respond to your personal attack.
To my mind, therefore, the President took absolutely the right line.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Anti-personnel mines
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0542/2001 by Mr Van Orden and Mr Van Hecke, on behalf of Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats;
B5-0561/2001 by Mr van den Berg and Mr Sakellariou, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists;
B5-0568/2001 by Mr Haarder et al, on behalf of the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party;
B5-0575/2001 by Mrs Maes and Mrs McKenna, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance;
B5-0590/2001 by Mr Segni, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group;
.
B5-0599/2001 by Mrs Bonino et al
on measures to promote an undertaking by non-governmental actors to ban anti-personnel mines.
Mr President, I think everyone is against anti-personnel mines.
On this point, I should like to express my astonishment that this motion for a resolution is addressed to actors other than states.
If the mines are produced and used, they are produced and used with the authorisation of states, and it would be up to those states to give an undertaking that mines will not be produced or used, and I do not even understand the title of such a resolution.
As far as I am concerned, the only interpretation is that Parliament is thus pledging its allegiance to the great powers and the nation states.
Mr President, I shall keep to the topic.
Landmines kill, every day and in many countries.
Landmines are a lethal threat daily in many dozens of countries.
In Kampuchea alone, over 35 000 people have been injured by landmines and those are the survivors.
Every day, mines are removed and every day new ones are laid.
The anti-landmine treaty of 1997 has been ratified by 19 countries and signed by 141.
Countries that have not yet signed include Russia, Yugoslavia, but also Finland, which uses mines to defend its border with Russia.
That is, of course, cheaper and helps bring down the defence budget.
We can understand that.
If Finland can use that argument, however, why not other countries too?
I should therefore like to call on the Member States to force present and future members, as well as countries that receive financial aid from the European Union, to sign the treaty.
Mr President, I speak on behalf of my colleague Mr Van Orden, who is absent today but who for many years has been directly involved in the work of overcoming the scourge of anti-personnel landmines.
Most EU Member States no longer have anti-personnel landmines in the operational armouries of their armed forces.
These weapons have indeed been banned for the past four years.
It is only irresponsible armed forces such as those in former Yugoslavia and armed groups of non-state actors engaged in civil war and insurgency that continue to use these dreadful weapons.
By definition such groups are not party to the Ottawa Convention to ban landmines.
This resolution draws attention to the fact and seeks to find ways in which these groups can be influenced.
This requires very careful consideration as we must take great care that we do not imply any sort of recognition of the legitimacy of these groups or of their actions.
We do not wish to distract EU resources from the priority task of mine clearance and assistance to mine victims. We wish to bring this matter to the attention of all the states party to the Ottawa Convention that will gather in Managua in Nicaragua later this month.
Mr President, the European Parliament' s position against anti-personnel mines and in favour of their total ban has already been clearly expressed in various resolutions.
The result of Ottawa is due to the work of certain specialised NGOs.
I believe that at the next meeting of the contracting parties to the Convention which will take place in Managua, the European Union should contribute to ensuring that the Convention is signed and ratified by more countries. There are 52 which have not signed it and many who are still to ratify it.
It should also contribute to ensuring that more resources are provided for the complete clearing of mines, since mines which are still buried are causing death and mutilation throughout the world, and the parties involved - State and non-State agents - should be forced to reach an agreement on a total ban of these mines.
Mr President, I will end by asking for recognition and support for the work of NGOs such as the initiative launched by the humanitarian organisation 'Geneva Appeal' and others, which are going to contribute to the disappearance of such a lethal and odious weapon as anti-personnel mines.
Mr President, what are we doing?
I think that is the question that is being asked and the question to which you are asking us to reply.
Well, first of all we have equipped ourselves with a framework of rules for the Union, and just before the summer recess we adopted two regulations against mines, so that we now have legal instruments on the basis of which we shall be able to take effective and coordinated action.
Then at the end of this month we shall be actively participating, together with the presidency, at the meeting in Nicaragua of signatory states to the Ottawa Convention, a meeting which we believe is extremely important, because we shall of course be discussing the challenges posed by the abolition of anti-personnel mines, sharing the practical experiences of those who have been involved in this action and, as most of you have asked us to do, putting pressure on those states which have not yet signed the Convention.
In our view, the objective remains the same and we are determined to achieve it, by obtaining a universal prohibition on the production, stockpiling, movement and use of anti-personnel landmines.
The achieving of this objective and the removal of the risk to which the millions of mines which still have to be removed from areas of conflict throughout the world expose not only human lives, but also economic activities, is chiefly the task of states and governments.
There is no doubt about that. Unfortunately, it sometimes happens that non-government actors also use anti-personnel landmines in internal conflicts or conflicts between states, and they too bear a responsibility for the suffering and devastation caused to populations and societies by mines
Experience has shown, as you have pointed out, that we need to explore new ways of involving non-governmental agencies in these campaigns against landmines, and of making them subscribe to the objective of a complete ban on such devices.
From this point of view, the Geneva appeal is an initiative with laudable intentions, but we must make sure that any future initiatives of this kind take place in the context of the considerable efforts which have already been undertaken by the international community.
As Parliament knows, the international campaign to prohibit landmines has assumed the form of a worldwide movement which the European Union has supported since the beginning.
This international campaign, in conjunction with a certain number of governmental and non-governmental agreements, has drawn up standards and action programmes which will supplement the international regulations of which the Ottawa Convention is an example.
We would therefore like to see, alongside this international regulatory framework, initiatives being set up to strengthen the action that is being taken within states and civilian society, and we are ready to support them.
We must analyse this Geneva appeal in detail, and encourage those who have instigated it to coordinate their activities closely with the ICBL and with other major agreements, so as to ensure that all the forces that are mobilised towards this objective never run the risk, given the magnitude of what is at stake here, of becoming dispersed.
There is still a lot to be done to consolidate the ambitious demands and objectives that were defined by the Ottawa Convention.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Drought in Central America
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0547/2001 by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra and Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats;
B5-0562/2001 by Mrs Díez González et al, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists;
B5-0569/2001 by Mr Sánchez García and Mr Gasòliba i Böhm, on behalf of the Group the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party;
B5-0574/2001 by Mr Mayol i Raynal et al, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance;
B5-0591/2001 by Mr Marset Campos et al, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left;
B5-0600/2001 by Mr Queiró and Mr Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group
on the drought in Central America.
Mr President, I will not waste part of the one minute I am allowed to convince Members of the extremely grave consequences of the sequence of natural disasters which have taken place in Central America.
However, I will use part of my speaking time to say that this has had short-term consequences.
In brief: one and a half million people are suffering from hunger in the region, not to mention the long-term consequences for sustainable development and the climate.
So far the European institutions have reacted by trying to alleviate the short-term consequences: with emergency aid and with deliveries of food, which have gone some way to alleviating the hunger in the region.
So far we have been incapable of responding to the long-term needs or shortages.
This resolution asks the Commission firstly to take account of these needs when drawing up the 2002 budget.
Secondly, that it implement actions which will serve to accelerate and promote a sustainable development policy in the field of agricultural development, which will serve to prevent drought and the long-term consequences which I mentioned previously.
Thirdly, I refer to section 4, relating to a policy of cooperation with the region in the long term, which would help to meet the needs which I stressed before.
Mr President, the truth is that the region of Central America has been suffering for too long.
First there were the death squads and the extreme right governments.
Then, with democracy won thanks to the mediation of the European Union, there were corrupt governments; then there were the catastrophes of Hurricane Mitch, earthquakes and now this drought, which, as has been said, means hunger, misery and death for hundreds of thousands of people.
The European Union must behave with a solidarity which distinguishes it from others, not only by approving budgets for this circumstance, but, as has been said, also for the coming years, by approving important and essential budgets which will eliminate the causes and consequences of this drought.
I drafted the report on the reconstruction of Central America after Hurricane Mitch, and I have seen that the corruption in the area prevents aid from arriving directly.
We therefore recommend that the aid which we grant arrives in the most direct way possible by means of local councils and democratic NGOs.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, every day we see horrifying images of new tragedies which desolate the world: people devastated, children dying from hunger and disease, refugees without refuge, immigrants wandering the world looking for an opportunity to live...
There are tragedies, however, which persist while nobody talks about them, which get worse and fester although they do not make the headlines.
One of those cases filed away in our selective first-world memory is the situation in Central America and the dramatic effects of the drought which has been devastating it for more than three months.
This is a tragedy which is unfolding in a region, as has been said, which is already weakened by constant natural disasters, quite apart from political disasters, and which has a social and economic structure lacking the least resources for resisting them.
El Salvador has declared a state of emergency and Guatemala just yesterday declared a state of public disaster, in a truly desperate attempt to combat hunger.
The drought has destroyed the majority of the crops in the region and hunger is now affecting millions of people, as previous speakers have said.
All of this in an area where an extremely high percentage of inhabitants live in poverty or extreme poverty.
The United Nations world food programme raised the alarm very recently, telling us that if the current situation continues, it will only be able to meet the needs of half of the affected citizens for barely three months.
I therefore draw your attention in particular to the recommendation contained in section 4 which, in relation to that in section 3, seeks to direct our decisions in the field of development aid towards the objective of combating the structural problems.
Only in that way, by investing in sustainable development in the most sensitive areas of the world, will we be able to prevent and alleviate as far as possible the effects of natural disasters, because we will have invested our aid and our resources in the structuring and strengthening of the population and we will have made them stronger so that they can endure the consequences of phenomena which not even we, in the first world, can prevent.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for Europe to be able to give out fishing rods, to show people how to fish, rather than to hand out fish.
Mr President, I agree with what other Members have said.
In any event, we in the European Parliament delegation for relations with the countries of Central America were in El Salvador in July and were able to see the consequences of the earthquakes and of Hurricane Mitch.
In fact there is a very important European Union programme for the rehabilitation of institutes in that area; at the moment, however, the worst thing of all, which we were informed of in July, is what is happening as a result of the drought.
I believe that we must envisage two types of aid: immediate aid, to prevent starvation, and a more long-term aid, in order to work towards sustainable development; because the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change believes that earthquakes, floods and droughts are going to become increasingly common, and in precisely the poorest parts of the world, which are least able to endure them.
Therefore, I believe that the European Union must use two approaches: immediate aid, which they requested of us when we were there in July, and more long-term aid, in order to prevent what is happening now from happening again.
We are also concerned about the distribution of aid.
It must be very well controlled by the services of the European Commission that are on the ground, so that it may reach the people genuinely affected.
Some complaints have been made about this.
The Commission is of course well aware of the situation described in this resolution.
The current drought in these countries is certainly the worst since the one caused by El Niño in 1997.
For the moment, however, we believe it is going too far to compare the situation with the one that followed Hurricane Mitch.
There is constant contact between the Commission and the representatives of the countries of Central America, and we believe, along with the representatives of those countries with whom we are working, that the situation is certainly extremely worrying, but that at this stage it is under control, and is unlikely to continue for very long because the rains will soon be returning to most of the areas affected by the drought.
Although the rains are due to return shortly, that should not prevent us from thinking about the real causes of these crises which, as you have all, I believe, pointed out, are due to cyclical factors but also, and above all, to structural factors, including the falling incomes from primary products, especially coffee, the probably inappropriate nature of agricultural policies, and increasingly difficult access for many rural families to production inputs, not to mention the poverty which is undoubtedly rife in all these countries.
With regard to monitoring, I should just like to say that the Commission and the Union now have a network of antennae which enables us to monitor the food situation in all the regions that are susceptible.
One of these antennae is located in Central America and will enable us to be alerted instantly so that we can intervene if necessary.
The heart of the problem, that is, the structural causes of the lack of food security in the region, is the real problem that we will have to face in the medium and long term, as some of you have pointed out.
One of the most important solutions, as we see it, is rural development, and this is already a priority in the Union' s action and cooperation in most of the countries concerned, and we would like to see it strengthened even more by the pooling of efforts, whether that means aid to local governments to enable them to concentrate their development policy in that area, something that we can actually do, or whether it means support for the projects of non-governmental organisations or local communities seeking to diversify production and crop distribution and to create family incomes of another kind, or whether it means coordination with other international donors, like Member States, or the Bretton Woods institutions, or, finally, whether it means putting in place programmes to reduce poverty in the countries concerned.
Like you, we are convinced that we shall have to cope with short-term emergencies, but that the problem is a deep-seated one and is one of the fundamental causes that will have to be tackled if we wish to avoid a repetition of the same problem.
Mr President, in the Spanish version of the resolution on the Afghan refugees off the coast of Australia there is an error, and I am pointing it out so that Parliament' s services may correct it.
In Recital E there is a line missing, since it says 'allow asylum seekers to request asylum once' and it should then say 'they have arrived in Australian territory' .
This text simply needs to be modified in accordance with the other versions - I have seen the English, the French and the German.
I point this out so that Parliament' s services may correct it.
Mr Medina Ortega, I trust you implicitly here because I know that you are extraordinarily well versed in the other languages.
I am sure this will be corrected.
I have already been assured from my right that this will be added in the Spanish version.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Mountain farming
The next item is the report (A5-0277/2001) by Mr Ebner, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on 25 years' application of Community legislation for hill and mountain farming.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the own-initiative report on 25 years' application of Community legislation for hill and mountain farming has arrived on the European Parliament's agenda in the run up to the International Year of Mountains in 2002.
Activities have therefore been planned over the coming year at international, national and local level to promote the sustainable development of mountain regions.
The main objectives of the International Year of Mountains are to create awareness and increase knowledge about mountain ecosystems and their dynamics and operation, to promote and maintain the cultural heritage of mountain communities and the maintenance and sustainable development of resources in mountain regions to safeguard the quality of life of the population now and in the future.
Finally, mountain regions account for about 30% of the land area and 20% of the utilised agricultural area in the European Union and 10% of the population of the EU live there.
I feel that the European Union should also use the coming International Year of Mountains as an opportunity to express the specific concerns of mountain regions and recognise mountain regions as indispensable habitats.
At the same time, the quality of life in mountain regions must be maintained and protected and the constant threat of exodus must be stopped.
This report is also, by definition, the European Parliament's position on the International Year of Mountains and should be seen by the Commission and the Council as our basic wish list.
Basically I call in this report, which was adopted almost unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for a comprehensive EU strategy for mountain regions.
The report contains numerous new and, to my mind, practical proposals which I call on you to support during the coming vote.
The Commission is thus called on, first, to submit a communication this year setting out EU actions in connection with the International Year of Mountains.
I think this communication should contain a comprehensive concept for the regions in question with regard to the period after 2006 and with regard to enlargement.
This will, of necessity, include revising Directive 268/75 and subsequent amendments.
At the same time, I should like to clarify that the overall concept needed must take account of the principle of subsidiarity.
Despite what are often similar problems and difficulties, it is a fact that even mountain regions differ in their individual characteristics, meaning that there is no universal patent solution.
Common problems can be solved more efficiently by means of a cross-border approach.
My report therefore advocates an approach which takes equal account of the following areas: farming and forestry, transport, tourism, energy and water, regional planning, nature conservation and the maintenance of the common cultural heritage.
Now a few words on individual demands set out in the report.
Agriculture: basically it calls for the second pillar of agricultural policy, the development of rural areas, to be extended, taking appropriate account of the contribution made by farming to the environment and the countryside and the multifunctional character of agriculture.
We need to find common problem-solving strategies in the form of regional conventions, set and update criteria and data on mountain areas and fund practical, mountain-related projects under the sixth framework programme, extend the basic infrastructure needed and provide training and further training so that the population keeps abreast of events and strengthen transport networks in mountain regions, taking account of the principle of sustainability, in order to safeguard these regions as habitats and economic areas and nature areas.
This means, for example, that access roads to farms and alpine pastures must be guaranteed, while bigger roads must comply with criteria of strict eco-compatibility.
Finally, last but not least, mountain regions need special treatment in the run up to enlargement.
The forthcoming International Year of Mountains is an ideal time, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to discuss the specifics of tomorrow's proposal.
You, ladies and gentlemen, by voting in favour of my report, and more importantly you, Commissioner, and the Commission, by implementing the ideas contained in it can make a fundamental contribution to this development.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
I should like to start by thanking Mr Ebner for his own initiative report.
This is a report which I can wholeheartedly support.
Given that, as Mr Ebner has just said, mountain regions account for around 30% of the land area in the EU, while in many Member States, such as Austria, they account for as much as 50%, I welcome and support this own initiative report.
The importance of mountain ecosystems is a cultural heritage.
The maintenance and sustainable management of resources is very important in numerous regions of Europe.
The protection of mountain regions, forests, water, the ecological balance and biodiversity needs to be set out in an overall European concept.
Many mountains straddle frontiers.
Many problems can only be solved more efficiently by means of a cross-border approach and by joining forces.
I must stress that farming and forestry have a multifunctional role in mountain regions and that this will be hugely important in an enlarged Union.
Both the people who live in the mountains and the tourists who visit every year looking for rest and relaxation value this unique natural and cultural landscape, which is why we must create appropriate incentives for people to live and work there.
We must take precautions to prevent the ecological and socio-economic consequences of exodus and depopulation.
Sustainable cultivation by mountain farmers not only provides quality food, it also renders a huge service to mankind as a whole.
The United Nations have rightly proclaimed 2002 as the International Year of Mountains.
I think it is important for Europe to take a stance now and for the Commission to present a communication as quickly as possible, setting out a really clear definition, taking account of criteria such as altitude, gradient and the vegetation which has been cut down so that we can really address the various problems throughout Europe, and proposing appropriate concepts for strategies and development mechanisms.
Mr President, the Ebner report is going to offer the Commission a very good model to follow when producing its communication for the International Year of Mountains 2002.
However, amongst its many and, I believe, very valuable, proposals, I would like to draw your attention to certain issues which, on this forthcoming celebration of the silver wedding of mountain farming, should receive very special, and in some cases new, attention.
I am referring, firstly, to the role which should be recognised for women in this new multifunctional mountain farming.
For them, a new approach is required today which is very different from their obsolete marginalisation within the traditional CAP.
This proposal appears in section 19 of the Ebner report, but if we want to do it well, Mr Fischler, coordinated approach is required.
Within the new agriculture of the mountain regions, women currently play many important roles, both in relation to agriculture and in relation to tourism, rural development, rural tourism, new technologies and in relation to craft-industry, commercial and economic policies.
I hope you understand, Commissioner, that their potential could be enormous.
Secondly, I would like to draw your attention to the proposal contained in section 22, which also relates to another of today' s pressing problems, that of migration policies.
It is proposed that mountain regions where population is decreasing could serve as reception areas for absorbing immigrants, given suitable socio-economic planning.
Thirdly, Commissioner, I believe that compensation measures should be taken to prevent mountain regions receiving less structural aid than they receive at the moment as a result of enlargement.
This must be prevented, because enlargement must not under any circumstances have a negative impact on these areas.
Lastly, I think that small and medium-sized farms should be promoted by means of a modulation of aid that stimulates employment.
Commissioner, I hope that if you really want to provide new impetus and a new strategy for mountain farming, you will take these proposals into account.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank Mr Ebner very much for the work he has done and also for accepting my amendments to the text.
The report speaks for itself: it is complete and exhaustive and also has the merit of setting mountain farming in a wider and more general context of mountain problems.
I think this approach is the right one for achieving a genuine European policy in 2002: International Year of Mountains.
You see, Commissioner, Agenda 2000 does mention mountain farming, but everything gets more complicated at the implementation stage, for instance when Italian regions give notification of intervention laws for mountain areas, for example on animal husbandry or indeed on natural disasters which have already occurred.
Well, your 'Agriculture' Directorate is turning into a worthy and legitimate control body.
It is beginning a long correspondence made up of requests for minute details. It will take at least six months or even more for definite replies to come in, frequently stamped on the closing date, sometimes using the competition rules which always seem to deny the particular characteristics of mountain agriculture.
Sooner or later, especially in the Alpine areas of the Union - lucky Switzerland takes care of its mountains without this network of controls - this could lead to an anti-European backlash.
That is why we ask you, Commissioner, to publicise the principles of this report on agriculture and remember, not just occasionally, that the Union has signed the Agriculture Protocol of the Alpine Convention.
Mr President, Mr Ebner, well done!
A good report.
Like under a burning glass, mountain farming shows what happens when you try and master sustainable land management tailored to a particular location.
Your report also has a drawback, however.
It only focuses on this aspect.
It is interesting that the House, or rather those still in it - although they do, after all, represent the majorities - can reach a majority understanding on these numerous excellent proposals and warnings.
It is true of agriculture as a whole that we should have fostered sustainable management in general, but then there would have been no agreement here, so that this acts as an alibi and that is a pity.
However, that should not detract from the usefulness of this report and we shall, of course, vote in favour of it.
We should like, however, to widen this debate to agriculture as a whole in order to achieve sustainable land management tailored to each particular location.
Mr President, apart from what is now the standard generalised wish list in the report, the fact that the new regulation will operate within the framework of Agenda 2000 leaves no room for any hope that the present frightful situation will improve or that the survival of farmers, most of whom run small or medium-sized holdings, will be assured.
As we know, the trend is towards greater liberalisation of agricultural production and the concentration of land and production in the hands of fewer and fewer people, with the result that mountain regions are sinking faster and faster into economic and social stagnation.
All that the proposal to offset the reduction in Community support for these regions by applying national and regional measures means in practice is that the European Union will completely abandon mountain regions and will attempt to shift even the miserable and ineffective support of the last 25 years on to its Member States.
This shift will have a massively adverse impact on countries such as Greece, which have a high proportion of mountain regions and a small budget, with the result that it will be impossible to support these regions from national funds.
In addition, this sort of proposal recommends nationalising the financing for policies formulated by the European Union, meaning that the poorest countries will be forced to apply anti-farming Community policy without any compensation or support measures and pay for it out of their own pockets.
Furthermore, the proposal to reject the removal of the milk quota system in mountain regions on the grounds of reduced competitiveness and high production costs is proof of the total lack of any social criteria and the annoying hypocrisy of the European Union's environmentally-friendly pronouncements, given that the same restrictive measures are being applied to mountain and industrial livestock farming, while we all know the differences between them as regards both the environment and public health.
What with grim neo-liberal criteria and the profit and competition argument, mountain regions are condemned to stagnation and abandonment.
It is for these reasons that we shall be voting against the report, because we believe that the specific measures proposed, operating within the more general framework of Agenda 2000 and the so-called competitiveness argument will not only reverse, they will speed up the economic stagnation and desertification of mountain regions, with huge economic, social and environmental consequences.
Commissioner, without waiting for 2002 and its International Year of Mountains, we twenty Members who are still here all agree that we should protect hill and mountain farming, which is said to represent 20% of our land.
I myself come from a region where there are mountains and where transhumance is practised, in our case with flocks of sheep.
It really is an ideal form of farming, especially for the European Commission.
You have the countryside, forests, biodiversity and the environment, you are preventing soil erosion and producing high-quality products, honey, meat and fruit, you have the tourist industry, and you put the accent on quality of life.
Above all, you are not practising productivism, you are not farming intensively, you are not annoying the United States in the world markets in wheat, oilseeds and animal proteins.
Basically, hill and mountain farming is multi-functionalism without the quantities.
It is the Austrian model that the 2006 reform of the CAP intends to generalise throughout Europe, including the lowland areas.
It conjures up a picture of rosy-cheeked milkmaids, accompanied, of course, by Commissioner Fischler, frolicking among haystacks, cow-bells, marmots and alpine pastures, and stroking rare-breed cows, while Mr Bush' s Texans have a monopoly in the meat market.
So let us say yes to hill and mountain farming, in the hills and mountains, but no to a European farming industry reduced by WTO negotiations to a series of theme parks with peasants dressed up by Mike Moore to look like Walt Disney characters, whose job would be to entertain Anglo-Saxon tourists and conserve the landscape.
Mr President, I want to thank Mr Ebner for a very comprehensive and stimulating report.
We could return to the subject at a later stage in another way and produce some costings and a tighter, more comprehensive proposal as to how we will put the ideals expressed in this report into effect.
We have to consider too that we will have a conflict.
Firstly there is the size of the budget we have and enlargement, which will also lead to an increase in the mountainous area within the European Union, while at the same time we refuse to produce any resources to finance the very idealistic proposals in this report which most people in this House would subscribe to.
In parts of the European Union at this moment people drive two hours to work in their cars, two hours home and live in overcrowded circumstances.
All the utilities are over-utilised while in other areas we are closing down public services. Roads are under-utilised, we are withdrawing police stations and closing down little churches and schools.
We in the European Union should not make the mistake the Americans made.
We should not abandon vast areas of our countries, where human activity will fade away.
These mountains will not be attractive if there are no villages, if there are no variable scenes of farms and livestock and people living there.
They will not provide the tourist amenities we need in the future.
If we allow this to happen, it will be like what we did in my country 50 years ago when we closed down our railways.
We will regret it in 40 or 50 years from now.
If we lose these areas as habitats for human beings and everything that goes with that then Europe will be so much the poorer and we will regret it.
We should fight within the European Union because individual States have failed.
I was in Scotland during the summer and I have seen the extent to which the Highlands have been denuded of their population.
Britain is much the poorer for that.
If we allow this to happen elsewhere we will have a Europe that will be much poorer.
We should return to this subject later and make firm proposals for the budgetary resources that we, as a Union, could use towards this end.
Mr President, the figures some Members have quoted amply demonstrate that the mountains are the minority of minorities in this House.
We represent only a little over 5% of the inhabitants of Europe, of European citizens, but, as documented in the annals of the European Parliament over fifty years of the European Union, this is only the third time that the word 'mountain' and a motion for a resolution about mountains have been heard in this Chamber.
The first time was in 1983. The rapporteur then was Mr Colleselli, from Cadore, in the North of Italy.
The second time, fifteen years later, I myself had the honour and the duty of bringing the problems of the mountains to this House, with my report on a new strategy for mountain regions, approved on 23 October 1998.
My report started from an overall view of the problems of mountain regions, in all their complexity, and concluded that mountain farming was and remains the key.
The Ebner report - and I congratulate the rapporteur on the specific detail he has been able to put into it - takes this aspect further and opens up another horizon. I can state that he starts precisely from the conclusions of the previous report by indicating that the salvation of the mountains we are all calling for can start from the farming sector itself.
However, we are all aware, once again, that farming cannot do it alone. That is why there are also proposals in Mr Ebner' s report which involve the whole mountain world: transport, infrastructure, tourism, the eco-system.
There is another factor we must protect and safeguard; the vital factor for the mountains, Commissioner, is and remains man.
The average age of farmers in Europe - as you know -is about 50. Some mountain farmers are over 60.
That is a dire statistic for the future of the mountains.
We must make mountain farming attractive again, give the farmers confidence, and give them resources.
Above all we must have the courage to recognise, Commissioner, that a specific type of farming called mountain farming exists. Let us do so with conviction so that the mountains themselves can continue to exist!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
The Commission has always seen hill and mountain farming as a very important and highly interesting subject.
I should like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and, more importantly, the rapporteur, Mr Ebner, for this own initiative report on 25 years' application of Community legislation for hill and mountain farming.
Starting with the 1998 Santini report on a new strategy for hill and mountain farming and with the International Year of Mountains coming up next year, the Ebner report highlights the importance of mountain regions to the European Union.
In particular, it stresses the importance of environmental protection and the need to maintain natural beauty spots, produce quality products and urgently maintain the cultural heritage.
It also points out that the viability of the countryside in mountain regions goes far beyond agriculture and depends on a multitude of factors.
It is clear from this starting premise that the same questions preoccupy us.
Multifunctionality is also the cornerstone of our new rural development policy.
It aims to promote farming in which all functions and services are recognised, every function which farmers offer our society.
This is an integral part of the European farming model and I can assure you, in response to a number of concerns expressed in the report, that the Commission will stand squarely behind the need to take account of this aspect during trade negotiations at the World Trade Association.
With enlargement impending, the report calls on the Commission to create a global strategy for mountain regions and hill and mountain farming both in the Member States and in the candidate countries.
On this point, I must say, the Commission approach differs from the approach taken in the report.
May I remind you that the new rural development policy only started up last year.
We placed subsidiarity right at the forefront of this new policy, so that the Member States could set their own priorities and include what they consider are the most suitable measures for making the best of their regions and dealing with local drawbacks or difficulties in their rural development plans or Structural Fund planning documents.
This decentralised approach, which also applies to the SAPARD programmes, means that the rural development programme can be properly tailored to mountain regions and can accommodate the differences between them. For example, the Pyrenees need different concepts from the Alps.
This fosters sustainable development which takes account both of socio-economic problems and the environmental challenges facing each of these regions.
Instead of laying down central guidelines, as was recently the case, we should be discussing how best to implement the mountain region policy in detail not just with all the Union institutions and bodies, the Member States, the regions and the local authorities but also with our economic and social partners, non-governmental organisations and scientific circles.
I should like to point out, à propos, that the Commission accepted the second report on economic and social cohesion on 31 January this year. This report raises the question of setting priorities for the balanced and sustained development of the regions in an enlarged Union and the question of covering increased cohesion requirements, to mention just two, and calls for discussion on the subject.
This report offers numerous opportunities to develop regions lagging behind.
The main aim of the Commission's contribution to the International Year of Mountains, therefore, is to advertise our current development mechanisms more widely.
The Commission will organise a seminar in the second half of the year at Commissioner Barnier's and my initiative, the purpose of which will be to present and advertise the opportunities which Community policy offers mountain regions.
You and any other interested parties are also invited to attend.
To come back to the report, I should like to emphasise that it is already possible as the law now stands to provide targeted support for hill and mountain farming through compensatory payments, which form and shall continue to form our basic support for mountain regions, and through environmental measures, through aid for forestry, through processing aid and marketing aid or through diversification aid, for example in the tourism sector.
I should also like to remind you, Mrs Rojo, that the instructions for drawing up rural development programmes state that express reference must be made to programmes specifically for women and that each of the rural development programmes must contain a chapter describing specific help for women.
The same rules apply to rural development and the common organisations of the market.
These too take account of the specific nature of extensive farming, especially in mountain regions, either through specific, customised measures such as beef extensification premiums or premiums for sheepmeat or goatmeat production or by giving the Member States additional room to manoeuvre by allowing them to give special support to regions of their choice.
The Commission will address special treatment for farmers in mountain regions in relation to milk quotas, as proposed in the report, as part of its midterm review.
Finally, we should not forget, with reference to the Structural Funds, that 95% of mountain regions come under Objective 1 or Objective 2.
These mountain regions can all apply under current support rules and the Member States can tailor the measures needed to individual demands, be it in relation to transport or telecommunications networks, basic public services or support for economic activities.
In principle, this can be complemented by national aid, as Mr Caveri mentioned.
Here too, however, the golden rule is that we continue to require notification a) because this gives regions the security of knowing that their measures will be seen to be compatible with EU law and b) because we must not allow unfair competition between individual regions.
I cannot address all the suggestions in the report, but I hope that the seminar organised by the Commission to coincide with the International Year of Mountains will give plenty of opportunity to come back to these suggestions.
In the meantime, the Commission will exercise its powers and right of initiative in order to examine the conclusions of the report in greater detail and continue the dialogue started today.
I am positive that this will allow us to successfully raise the profile of mountain regions and highlight their importance to Europe.
Thank you very much Commissioner Fischler.

Basic education in developing countries
The next item is the report (A5­0278/2001) by Mrs Kinnock, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on basic education in developing countries in the context of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children in September 2001 [2001/2030(INI)].
Mr President, as you suggested, this report is meant to focus on the real opportunity that the UN Special Conference on Children and Children's Rights which takes place later this month gives this Parliament to focus on a fundamental way in which we can tackle global poverty.
It is an opportunity for us not only to give a profile to this subject but also to call for action.
Let me set out what the targets are: free and compulsory education for all, halving adult illiteracy by 2015, eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary schools by 2005 and extending learning opportunities for adults and young people and improvements in the quality of education provided.
We are quite tired of hearing about development targets.
They are set and they are endless.
We know the 'whys' for all these development concerns.
What we from the Committee on Development and Cooperation are asking is 'how' we are going to deliver on these targets.
The subject is at the heart of the global strategy that we, in our committee, discuss on poverty.
The EU clearly has a key and central role to play here.
Clear commitments were made at Dakar in Senegal last year.
But neither from the EU nor anyone else really are we getting practical strategies.
I was a teacher myself for 30 years, mostly in primary education so I think I am quite justified in having a passion about looking at the reasons for this crisis.
One in six of the world's population are functionally illiterate.
One hundred and thirty million - one in five - of the total number of children are not in any kind of primary education.
One terrible statistic is that two-thirds of those are little girls.
Their learning situation is terrible.
Many of will have seen children trying to learn sitting under a tree with not even a blackboard to assist the teacher.
When we talk about information technology we are often talking about children who have never even held a pencil in their hand, never mind being likely to sit at the keyboard of a computer.
In these schools too the quality of their education is often affected by the fact that they are not taught in their own language.
There is a clear link between illiteracy and income poverty.
Average incomes in a country mirror very clearly the levels of access to education.
There is a clear link between child mortality rates and the level of parental education.
A 10% increase in girls' enrolment in primary school would bring a substantial improvement in infant and maternal mortality rates.
And yet we see aid from developed countries to basic education being slashed from budgets across the globe.
It is only 1% of the total.
Developing countries themselves take insufficient interest in the importance of education.
The sub-continent of India spends less than 1% of GDP on education.
As far as the EU is concerned, I hope the Commissioner will agree that this is not enough.
I hope you are not going to state in your presentation that all of this will be incorporated into existing procedures.
We need an answer from the Commissioner on how we intend to implement the goals.
I would like to hear how he intends to improve coordination of the national indicative programmes for Cotonou and about our involvement in the steering committee working on education in Africa.
I also know that there is a promise of a communication on basic education from the Commission during the Belgian Presidency.
I would like to know when we might expect to see that.
Let me just touch on one or two issues.
Priority for girls obviously, and I suspect that Mrs Junker will speak about that.
Last in, first out; that is what happens to girls.
Girls have a low status and therefore there is no priority for getting them into school.
I would like to see a lot more training in ministries in developing countries and concrete programmes to ensure that we get girls into school.
The impact of HIV is enormous.
There are millions of AIDS orphans in the developing world and in a country like Zambia there are more teachers infected annually with HIV than they are able to train to put in their schools.
These are clearly very critical issues for us to discuss.
Meeting the targets looks difficult.
Is there sufficient political commitment in current circumstances to ensure that we will get all the girls into school by 2005?
The reality is, and I hope that people will admit this very clearly at the UN Conference the week after next, that as things are going all of these targets are unachievable.
Meeting the target of universal primary education looks extremely difficult.
I would like to know from the Commission how its work in trying to achieve these targets includes NGOs and civil society and all those people who are involved in the Global Education Campaign.
It is a very successful, active and dynamic campaign.
I would hope that the European Commission is very much engaged with them but I suspect that is not the case.
According to the Global Education Campaign, the targets on education would require USD 8 billion a year.
This is the equivalent of four days of global military spending and 9 minutes of international currency speculation.
Therefore it seems to me that if the commitment was there, we could deliver.
It is a price worth paying.
The current inequities that I have described are untenable and certainly indefensible.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is fair that I begin my speech on behalf of the PPE Group by congratulating Mrs Kinnock on her excellent report and on the passion with which she is defending it.
I believe that the proposals in this report, together with the resolution which we approved at the last part-session in July, represent the best contribution this Parliament could have made to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children, because there is no question, unfortunately, that education is still the great unresolved issue within development cooperation, despite the formal declarations and the commitments given at the various international conferences which have addressed this issue.
The figures on the millions of children not attending school, which Mrs Kinnock pointed out, speak for themselves in this respect.
While it is a grave situation that so many children are being deprived of their fundamental right to education, it is even more grave that, as a result of the violation of this right, millions of people are immersed in poverty and under-development.
Because the key to prosperity and progress, especially in the context of the information and communication society which we live in today, lies in the level of education the people have access to.
The conviction that, by not dealing vigorously with the issue of education in the developing countries, we will not only fail to eradicate poverty, but that the gap between the rich and poor countries will increase, has certainly led us to place education at the centre of the global strategy for eradicating poverty.
In this respect, we have to recognise that the Dakar Conference on education for all represented a great step forward, but it is a step which will take us nowhere if action is not taken and if, in accordance with the decisions at Dakar, we do not quickly adopt a concrete world initiative directed towards creating strategies and mobilising the resources required to provide effective support for the efforts made on a national level - as one of the Dakar commitments states.
The European Union, as the main donor and insofar as it has made solidarity and the defence of human rights an essential dimension of its international action, has the responsibility to promote these strategies in close coordination with the other donors, including the Monetary Fund and the World Bank and with the participation of civil society and, with them, policies aimed at overcoming the obstacles which deny children access to a quality education.
And the European Union has the moral and political obligation to provide the financial resources necessary to achieve free education for all between now and 2015.
All of this can be done in accordance with the excellent proposals contained in the Kinnock report, which reflect both the practically unanimous feelings of the Committee on Development and the feelings of my group.
However, achieving this objective will also require us to urgently either cancel or restructure the debts of the developing countries in exchange for the funds made available as a result being directed to education programmes.
It will require making the developing countries themselves responsible and encouraging them, through persuasive measures if necessary, to fulfil the commitments given in Dakar and to give absolute priority to education.
Above all, it will require an increase in financial contributions and the allocation of at least 8% of official aid to development and to basic education, in line with the views of the people promoting the campaign for education for all.
Only through resources which match the challenge we have to face will it be possible to win the battle against illiteracy in the world.
I will end by saying that only in this way will it be possible for millions of children to exercise their fundamental right to education, an education which will allow them to open the doors to progress and one day become free men and women.
Mr President, the report by Mrs Kinnock is one of those which the Socialist Group has followed with the greatest interest and affection.
The text gives figures which are often so scandalous that they should provide little comfort for our consciences, because, at the end of the day, they demonstrate the incoherence of almost all of us who believe that the education of children is important for the success of any development process.
There are plenty of declarations recognising that child education in the under-developed world is one of the main conditions if those countries are to be able to begin to free themselves from the situation of justice and backwardness they are in.
Mrs Kinnock' s report mentions the numerous commitments made in this regard by the international community on different occasions. The latest was the world conference on education, which took place in Dakar last year.
The report, however, is also a compendium and a condemnation of incoherences and irresponsibilities.
Incoherence and irresponsibility on the part of the developed countries which, despite their promises, have not only failed to increase their programmes in favour of education and care for children in the developing world, but in fact have reduced their efforts in that area.
And incoherence and irresponsibility on the part of the countries of the South which, apart from very few exceptions, are still neglecting the education of their youngest citizens in the face of other priorities such as military expenditure which, in the majority of cases, is still above what is invested in education.
The resolution which we are voting on should not remain, like so many others, as a worthless piece of paper.
This call for coherence and responsibility is a genuine demonstration that our Parliament should promote this issue as a European Union objective.
Furthermore, however, this report should serve as a reference for the action of the Union and many European States, members or candidates for accession, at the United Nations General Assembly which will take place in New York in a few days time.
Glenys Kinnock will be there and will speak out clearly, in the knowledge that we all support her and with the strength which the support deriving from our approving her proposals will give her.
Documents such as this are the best way to respond with specific proposals to a form of globalisation which, since it is mainly focused on the market, is creating inequalities, poverty and exclusion on a world scale and is therefore becoming repellent to many people throughout the world.
I will end by offering our thanks and congratulations to Mrs Kinnock on her work. It will be important to implement what is expressed here, but we must start by broadly distributing the report.
This will convince and guide many people and will increase the credibility of the European Parliament amongst the citizens of Europe. It will also contribute to some people outside our territory recovering their confidence in us as well as their own sense of hope.
What does the practice of education in the developing countries teach us?
Above all, that good primary education is still far from being granted the priority status that it deserves.
Good, free education is essential for development.
Nine hundred million people are still illiterate.
The Dakar objectives are in danger of not being achieved by a long chalk.
For this reason, new impetus is necessary at the highest political level, particularly from Europe, America and Japan.
There is an urgent need for a strategically developed initiative with a realistic timescale and more financial resources.
Indicative programmes must be drawn up for each country.
Up to now, the European Union has paid far too little attention to education.
The argument that other donors are already doing sufficient is simply and demonstrably untrue.
The cause for the shortfall in educational facilities lies not only with the donors.
Many developing countries themselves give it far too low a priority.
It is outrageous that in Africa twice as much money should be spent on military equipment as on education.
If India continues to spend less than 1% of its GDP on school facilities, of course, development will never come off the ground.
The report of Mrs Kinnock is excellent.
Certainly, special attention will have to be paid to girls, early school-leavers, and also former child soldiers.
The basic rights of children will only be respected if adults draw the right political lessons from failing educational practice.
Mr President, we have, of course, far too little time to discuss Mrs Kinnock' s excellent report properly.
I share her scepticism about the great conferences where people in expensive suits and large expense accounts meet to talk about priorities that they afterwards immediately forget, while the education budgets of the poorest countries are falling and the number of children condemned to illiteracy continues to rise.
I really have the impression that a number of countries are acting like some governments in the nineteenth century: keep them poor and keep them stupid, then they will be less trouble.
That is, in fact, the strategic reason I can identify behind the manifest neglect of primary education.
That primary education has also had far too low a priority in our own budgets for development cooperation.
Fortunately, fellow MEPs have already said much that is true.
I will therefore restrict myself to a few suggestions relating to that primary education in Mrs Kinnock' s report, which are particularly pertinent.
That education must be free.
Children must not be excluded because they cannot afford primary education; otherwise they are condemned to the street, condemned to exploitation through child labour, and so on.
On the contrary, we should actually give scholarships to children from poor families, so that they can go to school, to cover the miles, to pay for their uniforms, etc.
The teachers must also be paid, they must be trained and they must receive a wage that enables them to survive in a decent way, so that they do not have to leave the children to their own devices because they must urgently earn something extra to at least give their own families some food.
It is clear that national action plans will need to be put in place.
I expect much more from governments that are aware of the problem, but in that case we must also be prepared to support those governments and increase their administrative efficiency.
We are far too inclined to sit on the sidelines with our expensive specialists and our expensive NGOs, while we, in fact, give far too little support to the meagre educational facilities in those countries themselves.
That does not detract from the fact that I expect the EU to translate all those words into action.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Kinnock's report is a huge achievement and is to be welcomed unreservedly.
The ACP countries of sub-Saharan Africa are some of the least developed countries.
There are depressing educational deficits here and women and children are deprived of even the most rudimentary basic education.
There are examples, however, which give cause for hope and it is these which I should like to address.
The government of Mali which, as you know, is a bitterly poor country in the Sahel, has imposed an ambitious political programme which courageously tackles decentralisation and comprehensive education reforms.
Children in Mali, boys and girls, are to receive a good school education, where possible in their regional or ethnic dialect.
That is easier said than done, however, because no teachers have been trained in the regional dialects and there are no corresponding curricula, let alone books.
Teachers need to be trained first and books need to be written first; and that is not something which can be done overnight and it is not something which can cover the whole country straight away.
You only have to think of the nomadic groups in the desert.
They require special schools and special arrangements, to name but one example.
This is an enormous challenge in education policy and is being extremely well supported by numerous donor organisations.
The radio can help, especially in sparsely populated regions.
The numerous local and regional stations which have started up in Mali, as in other developing countries, could easily be used for decentralised education plans, even if the tapes used are produced centrally.
Lessons over the radio have always been a way of life in the Australian outback.
In Africa, customised electronic methods and mobile schools could go a long way towards rectifying the education deficit.
It would be rewarding for the development cooperation of the European Union if we were to be involved in these new methods.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the resolution tabled in the run up to the UN Special Conference on Children and congratulates you, Mrs Kinnock, on your most comprehensive report.
Your report rightly highlights the need for urgent measures to implement the framework for action set out in Dakar.
The Commission has also decided to put development policy, especially the education and health sectors, at the top of its agenda in 2002.
Child welfare is a fundamental concern and a basic objective.
An objective that we want to pursue mainly though social policies in sectors such as education and health.
Related questions were addressed last year in the Council and Commission declaration on the European Community's development policy in connection with the fight against poverty.
They also play a pivotal role in the Cotonou partnership agreement.
The Commission has also stepped up support in the education sector and focused measures on basic education, especially primary school education, in recent years.
As a result, the Community has considerably increased the general funds allocated to this sector in comparison with others.
In addition, most programmes to promote primary school education contain special clauses for the benefit of girls, in order to counter gender-based drawbacks.
As far as the specific considerations and recommendations which relate to the Community are concerned, I have the following to say: first, the education sector is instrumental in the strategy to fight poverty, which is the overriding aim of the Community's development policy.
The Commission shares the view that clear objectives need to be defined, that education aspects need to be included in the fight against poverty and that civil society needs to be involved.
The Commission also takes this standpoint in negotiations with developing countries on strategies to fight poverty.
The Commission is determined to play an active role in these negotiations and to further international development objectives.
Secondly, the Community made a formal undertaking in Dakar last year by backing the vision of the world declaration on education for all based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that education is a human right.
This means that the Community has also subscribed to the call for countries seriously committed to education not to be impeded in implementing this objective by a lack of funds.
The Commission shares the view of the European Parliament that better coordination and more complementarity between Community measures and national projects, with the help of the Group of Experts on Education, and more intensive cooperation with UNESCO and the Association for the Development of Education in Africa are of paramount importance in improving the effectiveness of Community aid.
The Commission is therefore stepping up its collaboration with UNESCO, especially by supporting UNESCO in coordinating education for all partners.
The Commission is also involved in the working party set up to implement the framework for action set out in Dakar.
It is also promoting the objectives of education for all in its negotiations on the ACP countries' strategies for the ninth EDF.
As far as the difficult question of setting up a global fund for basic education is concerned, the Commission feels, given the Commission procedure for programming and implementing aid, that this sort of fund is not a practicable solution.
However, the Commission does not in principle reject the idea of a global initiative, as provided for in the Dakar framework for action, even if the implementation methods need to be discussed in detail.
Thirdly, the question of children's rights is closely bound up with the gender problem in general.
Education targets for children, especially girls, will not be met until women have an equal status in the family and in the various societies.
The Commission is very firmly in favour of paying particular attention to the education needs of girls in developing countries.
It is currently preparing an action plan on equal treatment for men and women which should deal with this problem.
It is also taking gender-specific questions into account in all special education programmes.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately.
VOTE
The next item is the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
Report (A5­0277/2001) by Mr Ebner, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on 25 years' application of Community legislation for hill and mountain farming [2000/2222(INI)]
Mr President, there is a problem with the text at item 11, page 10, in the part about mountain wine-growing.
In the Italian text there is a contradiction in the third line from the end where it says that no distinction should be made between the costs of planting vineyards in lowland areas and on mountains. In fact, the sense of the committee' s work and, obviously, the sense of the amendments which have been tabled is that the costs of planting vineyards in lowland areas and on mountains should be compared with the costs of hill vineyards.
. (NL) An agriculture that is increasingly relying on the world market will try to produce as cheaply as possible, at the expense of the quality of work, of nature, of the environment and of animal welfare.
The least productive regions will be abandoned first.
Those are areas that have been uninhabited over a long period, because it requires more effort to earn a living.
The people who had nevertheless finally settled there, were the outcasts of society.
Often they were ex-convicts, ethnic minorities and losers in the battle for the best land.
The least productive areas where the losers wound up are not only the mountain areas, but also low-lying wetlands, that is, old bogs, the bottom of which consists of peat, a water retaining vegetable material that, when dry, shrinks and disappears.
Farmers in mountains and wetlands now play an important role in nature conservation, recreation and water management.
In a free, unprotected market, they are doomed to disappear.
Then their working and living area will not return to primeval nature, but will go to the dogs.
Mechanising and destroying the landscape to allow it to be cultivated more easily is not an acceptable alternative.
That is why I should like to back the proposed supporting measures, but to register an objection if these are limited to the mountains alone.
We shall ask the services to compare the versions and to take account of your comments.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5­0278/2001) by Mrs Kinnock, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on basic education in developing countries in the context of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children in September 2001 [2001/2030(INI)]
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Ebner Report (A5­0277/2001)
Kinnock Report (A5­0278/2001)
. (FR) We support the author of the report in her demand that free, compulsory and high-quality education should be provided for all children up to the age of 15.
However, even in European countries where there are laws to that effect, the free aspect is largely a formality, since it does not include the equipment that children need for school, which penalises children from poorer families, not to mention the overloaded classes and under-equipped state of schools in working-class districts.
These troubles are even more keenly felt in developing countries, even where education is compulsory.
The report claims that solving the education crisis is one of the most effective strategies for breaking the poverty cycle.
This is turning reality upside-down.
Without breaking the poverty cycle, in other words without stopping the pillaging of poor countries and the impoverishment of their working populations, even the most well-intentioned speeches will remain speeches, and millions of children in poor countries will continue to be deprived of even a minimum education.
Our vote in favour of this report means that we agree with the intentions expressed but only subject to these conditions.
That concludes voting time.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 6.55 p.m.)
Acts of terrorism in the United States
Ladies and gentlemen, I open this extraordinary meeting with the emotion and the sadness that this horrific event, the scale of which would have seemed inconceivable, inspires in us all.
The purpose of this meeting is first of all to demonstrate our solidarity with the American people, who have just been struck by a barbaric act of terrorism, to show our compassion for the victims, for the final toll will certainly be appalling, and to demonstrate our support for all those who are working tirelessly to save what further lives they can.
Yesterday, I expressed this solidarity to President Bush, on my own behalf and on behalf of the entire European Parliament and gave him my assurance that the people of Europe are standing shoulder to shoulder with the United States in the tragic ordeal the American nation is suffering.
When terrorism strikes in a Member State of the European Union we all feel concerned, and these appalling attacks inspire in me the same feeling of disgust and indignation.
Today, we share the pain of the American people.
It is the United States, that great democracy which did so much to help Europe protect its freedom that has just been attacked, but a blow has also been dealt to the sacrosanct values of life and democracy.
The date of 11 September 2001 will remain forever engraved on the memory of humanity.
This tragedy calls for a calm reaction on our part but also for the closest cooperation between all countries that reject terrorism so that the perpetrators of these abominable crimes and those who have supported them can be identified, pursued, arrested and tried and so that blind terrorism can, at last, be eradicated from the surface of the globe.
It also requires the international community to commit itself to finding a peaceful solution to the conflicts that nourish and sustain fanaticism.
Over and above statements, over and above the common response to terrorism that we hope and pray for, all players on the international stage must now shoulder their responsibilities.
From now on resolute action must be the order of the day and I know that the European Union will have to take decisions of vital importance.
I welcome the presence here today of Prime Minister Verhofstadt, Mr Michel, Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Mr Prodi, President of the Commission.
The European Union will have no credibility if it does not establish a common policy on combating terrorism.
The European Commission and the European Parliament have stated this clearly, particularly during our last part-session.
I hope that the Council will study these proposals without delay.
Since the Tampere European Council, some tentative progress has, admittedly, been made with regard to the European area of freedom, security and justice, but this falls considerably short of what is needed.
We must go further.
Although the European Union has made its presence felt on the international stage, in the Middle East, at Durban and even in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, yesterday' s events are proof, if proof were needed, of the imperative need to establish a Europe of defence and a genuinely common foreign and security policy as quickly as possible.
An extraordinary European Council meeting could provide a timely boost to all these elements for, as we know, history waits for no man.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us now observe a minute' s silence for all the victims.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
- (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, just over 24 hours ago the United States was hit by an attack of unprecedented scale and ferocity.
At this very moment men, women and children of all ages, of all convictions and of all origins are struggling for their lives, while others are mourning the loss of loved ones and others still are suffering the anguish of waiting for reassuring news about the fate of those who are missing.
Madam President, our thoughts are with our American friends who have been assailed by this despicable and barbaric violence.
We would like to be able to express just how much we share their suffering.
Today, we feel that we are all Americans.
I say that, and let there be no mistake about this, because it is not just the United States and its population that has been targeted, but democracy itself. Democracy and its values of liberty, tolerance and humanity, which are the exact opposite of blind and suicidal terrorism.
As human beings, as believers in democracy, and as Europeans, we cannot nor will we ever be able to accept this barbarity.
Madam President, the Union that we want to build has its origins precisely in the rejection of the hate, fanaticism and murderous madness that nearly led to the downfall of our continent.
And in the face of these tragedies a comprehensive range of concrete and firm gestures is called for.
The various Member States have taken essential initiatives to come to the aid of the United States of America.
Madam President, on behalf of the Union, and following consultation with the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and the leaders of all the Member States, I have conveyed our deepest sympathy to President Bush.
As a token of solidarity and sympathy, the Union has decided that on Friday, 14 September a day of mourning and solidarity with the American people will be observed.
The Heads of State and Government of the fifteen EU Member States will be issuing a joint political declaration in the morning.
At 12 noon, a three minutes' silence will be observed, during which all activity will be suspended.
(Loud applause) The candidate countries for accession to the European Union are also invited to join us in this act of solidarity.
With this expression of solidarity, in addition to the political decisions which we will be taking in the coming weeks, the people of the European Union wish to express their deep sympathy with the grief, and particularly the pain, which is affecting the American people today.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, an extraordinary meeting of the Commission took place this morning.
We observed a minute' s silence and then discussed the various political aspects of this appalling tragedy which fall within the direct remit of the Commission.
This afternoon, I stressed before the European Parliament and the General Affairs Council that Europe must demonstrate full solidarity with the American people and adopt a common European position on all aspects of these tragic events.
The Commission is appalled by these criminal, barbaric deeds and has already sent its condolences to the victims and their families and expressed its sympathy for the American people.
Our cooperation with the United States in the fight against terrorism is more essential than ever and must be pursued.
Over the next few days, the Commission will examine the other proposals made in order to be able to take increasingly effective action to fight terrorism.
We are fortunate in that the economic and social structure of our countries is strong and resilient.
Therefore, even in these sad circumstances, we can remain calm and confident, and we will not allow terrorism to divide us or to divide the world in its goals or in its endeavours to achieve them.
We must reflect at this time on the role of Europe.
This criminal action is an attack on all our common values and on freedom itself.
After this event, nothing will ever be the same.
We therefore need to show great solidarity and friendship towards the American people and their government, and the European institutions and governments will work closely with our US and other friends at this tragic time and in the future.
However, there is also a purely European dimension.
The tragic events we have witnessed highlight once again the need for a united, strong, resolute, unified Europe which protects freedom and safeguards peace in Europe and throughout the world, a Europe that acts united alongside countries which share our goals, that acts united to protect and promote the values of freedom and solidarity, the values which are the basis of the democracy preserved by Parliament.
I invite you, therefore, to reflect upon yesterday' s tragedy.
Our citizens will only be able ensure peace and stability for themselves and for their children if they are united in their actions and if they feel that they can count on Europe.
This is the path we must take to safeguard our people: we must follow it courageously, resolutely and responsibly.
(Loud applause)
- (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, on behalf of the Council, to express our immense horror, outrage and revulsion at the tragic events which hit the United States yesterday morning.
I wish here, on behalf of the European Union, on behalf not only of its leaders but also of all the citizens of Europe, to reiterate our most sincere sympathy for the victims and their families and for the American people and the government of the United States.
This abominable act, which has caused such pain to the American people, is of course also an attack on the universal values which Europe has always shared with America.
I would like, on behalf of the Council, to solemnly reaffirm here the unfailing solidarity of the peoples of Europe with the American people in defending these values.
We want the United States to be aware that Europe is by its side in combating the evil of terrorism, no matter what form it may take.
We cannot allow anonymous terror to undermine the values of the free and democratic world.
We will stand together in attacking the major threat represented by large-scale terrorism.
The battle against this scourge will be all the more effective to the extent that it is supported by preventive actions and a detailed political dialogue with the countries of those regions of the world where terrorism has its roots.
Yesterday' s terrorist attack on the territory of the United States is an unprecedented act of provocation and of particularly loathsome cruelty.
Acts of such barbarity, terror and cowardice cannot be tolerated.
The scale of this tragedy demands an appropriate response.
In conjunction with its allies, the European Union will examine all possible means of preventing such acts and of responding to them in an appropriate manner.
The European Union will step up its activity in the international bodies responsible for the fight against terrorism with a view to ensuring that the perpetrators, accomplices and sponsors of acts of terrorism are rendered powerless.
However, our determination should, under no circumstances, fail to go hand in hand with responsible prudence.
At this moment we do not know the identity of the perpetrators, sponsors and possible accomplices of these terrible attacks.
These are essential factors in being able to judge and react in a rational manner with a responsible and meaningful attitude.
We must avoid any type of impromptu action.
While awaiting a response to these questions, our governments have taken the necessary steps to protect their people.
The Council has been informed of security measures adopted as a matter of urgency by the Member States.
In order to maximise cooperation between us, the Council has asked the Justice, Home Affairs and Transport Councils to take whatever measures are necessary to maintain the highest level of security as quickly as possible, particularly in the area of air transport, together with all measures required to prevent other attacks.
The Justice and Home Affairs Council on 27 September and the informal Transport Council on 14 September will evaluate those measures already taken and any that may be necessary to complement them.
The Extraordinary Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers has condemned these acts of barbarity, which are an insult to our common values, in the strongest terms.
We have declared 14 September 2001 a day of mourning in the 15 Member States.
We have asked the presidency to maintain close contact with the United States so as to study with them how best to provide whatever help may be required.
At the request of several Member States, the Secretary General of NATO has informed the Council of the discussions in progress within that organisation.
I can now read to you the declaration by the European Union:
"The Council of the European Union, meeting in special session today, in the presence of the Secretary General of the Atlantic Alliance, expressed its horror at yesterday' s terrorist attacks in the United States.
The Council stressed its complete solidarity with the government of the United States and the American people at this terrible time and extended its deepest sympathy to all the victims and their families.
We ask all Europeans to observe three minutes of silence on Friday, 14 September at 12 noon and we also declare 14 September 2001 a day of mourning.
These horrendous acts are an attack not only on the United States but against humanity itself and the values and freedoms we all share.
The life and work of our open and democratic societies will continue undeterred.
The Union utterly condemns the perpetrators and sponsors of these acts of barbarism.
The Union and its Member States will spare no efforts in helping identify, bring to justice and punish those responsible: there will be no safe haven for terrorists and their sponsors.
The Union will work closely with the United States and all partners to combat international terrorism.
All international organisations, particularly the United Nations, must be engaged and all relevant international instruments, including those concerned with the financing of terrorism, must be fully implemented.
The Community and its Member States have offered the United States all possible assistance with search and rescue operations.
Discussions are underway to establish what help would be most useful.
Recalling the strong and enduring ties which exist between the European Union and the United States, the Council has asked the presidency to stay in close contact with the government of the United States in order to convey this message of solidarity."
Following on from that, Madam President, these are the conclusions of the Council, so that you will be in receipt of all the relevant information:
"The Council expressed the profound solidarity of the European Union with the American people and approved a declaration condemning the terrorist attacks in the United States.
The Council was informed of the security measures taken by the Member States.
To ensure maximum cooperation between the latter, the Council asks its Justice and Home Affairs and Transport compositions to take all the necessary measures as soon as possible to maintain the highest level of security, particularly in the field of air transport, and any other measures needed to combat terrorism and prevent terrorist attacks.
The Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on 27 and 28 September, or earlier if necessary, together with the informal Transport Council meeting on 14 and 15 September, will evaluate the measures which will already have been taken and those which should supplement them.
The Council reaffirms its determination to combat all forms of terrorism with all the resources at its disposal.
The Council also took note of the declaration by the Commission and the President of the ECOFIN Council.
The Council has requested the presidency, the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission submit, as soon as possible, a report on concrete measures that may be recommended to speed up the implementation and the strengthening of the operational instruments of both the Common Foreign and Security Policy and in the field of Justice and Home Affairs.
These measures will be aimed at increasing the capacity of the European Union to fight effectively, together with the United States and all our partners, international terrorism.
As for the Council, it intends to return to these measures regularly in order to ensure, in particular, that all the actions taken by the European Union are coordinated."

- (DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my group' s sincere thanks to you, Madam President, for having convened this sitting, which gives us all an opportunity to express our deepest sympathy for and solidarity with those families that have suffered losses, with the President of the United States of America, with our colleagues in the US Congress and with everyone in the United States of America.
Yesterday' s horrendous attack in Washington and New York was not just an attack on the United States, but an attack on the entire civilised world, an attack against every one of us, including those in this Chamber.
It was an attack on our ideals of democracy, human rights and peace.
We are filled with grief and horror in the face of this disaster, a disaster which must never be repeated, and the forces of civilisation throughout the world must now work shoulder to shoulder with the United States to bring those responsible for this attack to account, and we must work closely together to prevent future terrorist attacks.
We must find a way to stop attacks of this kind being planned again, and this will also require a whole new dimension in European and international cooperation.
We must commit ourselves today to launching a fight against terrorism, so that the apocalyptic events in New York and Washington do not mean a global apocalypse tomorrow, and as a Parliament we can be proud of the fact that last week we adopted Mr Watson's anti-terrorism report by such a huge majority.
For a few hours yesterday I had the impression that the United States' ability to act had been compromised. The United States is a world power to which we owe a debt of gratitude for fighting against Nazism in the Second World War and thus guaranteeing a peaceful future for Europe and it is a world power which has firmly resisted totalitarian communism, which ultimately led to the collapse of the wall dividing Berlin, Germany and Europe.
On behalf of my group I would like to say that it is in our interest for America to retain its ability to act and to be strong, and for America to remain a good partner and friend to the European Union, and we should work together towards this goal in future.
(Loud applause)
We do not know who the perpetrators are.
There are certain assumptions, but I would counsel against surmising that these assumptions are true.
Above all, should these assumptions be confirmed, I would counsel us all against applying them to the Arab and Islamic world as a whole.
I have never forgotten an outstanding speech given by Anwar al Sadat, the assassinated President of Egypt, on 10 February 1981.
He said that Islam should never be judged by the misguided and irresponsible actions of people professing to be adherents of this great faith.
Islam is a religion based on tolerance, not fanaticism, a religion based on love, not hate, and it is a coherent religion based on order, not chaos.
We should beware of making generalisations, and we should make it clear that we not only wish to live in partnership with our American friends, but that we also want to live in partnership and, if possible, friendship with those Arab and Islamic countries that are committed to peace.
(Loud applause)
We should commit ourselves today to building an order in Europe and throughout the world in conjunction with all our neighbours - an order in which Europe is strong and united.
That is why, Mr President-in-Office, it gives such an impressive signal that both you and the President of the Commission are here today, a signal that we Europeans are united and strong, and that we wish to coexist in friendship and partnership with all our neighbours, on the basis of human rights, democracy, freedom, social well-being and, above all, peace.
That must be the message we send out today, the day after the dreadful events of 11 September 2001.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, our group shares the indignation and horror at the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington.
We wish to express our solidarity with the families of the American victims of these horrendous attacks.
We would also like to express our profound sadness to the families of the European victims and all those who have lost relatives, whatever their colour or continent of origin, because this diabolical attack was not only directed against the American people, but also against the Europeans and the other people who live together in the cosmopolitan world of New York, and we must remember that the World Trade Centre is just a few steps from the headquarters of the United Nations.
This is an attack on our common values, on democracy, on the very foundations of our civilisation.
As the late lamented Francisco Tomás y Valiente, President of the Spanish Constitutional Court, who was murdered by terrorists, wrote in an almost posthumous article: "Every time a person is killed, something dies within us" .
Exactly a week ago, this Parliament unanimously approved the resolution against terrorism.
Then it was a European problem for certain States.
Today we can see that the situation has changed qualitatively: terrorism has also been globalised as a result of a lethal combination of fanaticism, cowardice and high technology.
Our film archives are full of horror and disaster movies, with monsters attacking New York and other cities.
What happened yesterday reminds us that we do not need monsters: we humans are monsters when we lose our minds.
And as in Goya' s painting, 'the illusion of reason produces monsters' .
We Europeans must play a very significant role in the fight against globalised terrorism, in the fight for common values, for a more peaceful and just world.
We want to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Americans, with our colleagues in the United States Congress, and also with the rest of our allies, in a joint action to resolve the most ferocious conflicts on the planet with perseverance and decisiveness.
We welcome the fact that the Americans, led by their President, despite this cowardly aggression, have so far acted with cool heads, containing their rage, as yesterday Kofi Annan rightly asked them to do.
We would ask the leaders not to change that attitude, not to respond to terror with terror, that we may act jointly, above all in order to achieve something very important, because now is the time to strengthen our alliance with the United States and with all the people of the world who share our ideal of peace, justice and freedom.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, colleagues, this is an important place in which to celebrate this important moment.
We in this Parliament are the tribune of the peoples of the European Union and we have gathered here today to declare solemnly our outrage, our sympathy, our solidarity and our common bond in humanity and democracy with the people of the United States of America, and with the people of New York City and Washington D.C.
We witnessed yesterday a profoundly shocking event.
It is a new and low threshold in the tide of human affairs.
We witnessed an act of war - without a declaration of war - by persons, movements or states, as yet, not fully determined, but who acted with a grim and focused determination.
We must make sure that our response is common and not isolated, shared and not unilateral, aimed at our common enemy, which is terrorism, but not at wider forces such as Islam or the wider Arab world, should that be the source whence this monster may have sprung.
This modern apocalypse is America' s injury, but the wounds are universally shared among the community of democratic nations.
To the people of the United States of America, to its President, its Congressional and civic leaders, and its communities throughout the country, especially the peoples of New York and Washington, to the grieving families of the missing and the dead and to those who have survived the ordeal, we express our sympathy in this hour of hardship and devastation.
New York is a very special place.
It is a multi-cultural microcosm of the whole world.
It is a special gateway between our old continent and the New World.
It was through Ellis Island that in earlier generations, before the spirit of democracy took the deep root it has right across our continent, that our huddled masses, our oppressed and our starving went to find freedom, democracy and opportunity.
It is no accident that when the French Republic gave the people of the United States a gift to celebrate 100 years of that great republic, that they called that statue 'Liberty': no accident either that her extended arms should carry a torch of freedom.
When someone touches that symbol, they touch us all deeply, because it is part of our common, human, democratic bond and inheritance.
I remember, as a schoolboy, seeing on television at home a visit by John Fitzgerald Kennedy to places I had never been in our divided continent.
I remember his visit to the great symbol of that gross division, Berlin, with its wall. I remember as a boy I could understand, although I did not know about politics or international affairs, that when that man said, "I am a Berliner" , he said something deep and meaningful in terms of solidarity at that time.
Today, as the Prime Minister has remarked, we are all Americans, we are all New Yorkers, we are all Washingtonians.
We share the sense of shock and horror.
We share the bewildered outrage, we feel the vulnerability, for this is our common inheritance from yesterday's barbarous outrage.
We share common democratic values and interests and we stand together willing to fight against terrorism and promote those interests and values.
It is important that we as Europeans say to the Congressional leadership today: 'You do not stand alone.
You are not isolated.
We can make common cause in this matter, and we must do so.'
But, most of all, we stand today in our common bond of humanity as our American friends bravely search for their survivors and for their dead.
Language often fails us on these occasions.
My own colleagues have asked me to invite you, Madam President, in addition to this solemn moment, to open a book of condolence that we might also convey through that, at some appropriate time to the Congress, our interlocutor in US democracy, that in spite of the space which divides us across the Atlantic, we are resolutely united by the bonds of democracy and freedom and in the fight against terrorism.
Our message to them today, in this fight for democracy and against terrorism, is that our only choice is to stand united; for united we stand but divided we shall fall.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, President of the Commission and the Council, the world today seems much bleaker than it did before Tuesday' s shocking events.
The horrific images of the brutal and cowardly acts of terrorism on the World Trade Centre in New York and the Pentagon in Washington will stay in our minds forever.
No cause could ever justify such a terrifying act of cold-blooded barbarism.
On behalf of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group, I want to express the deep sorrow we feel for the victims who died in this tragedy and wish to send my heartfelt condolences to the families and all those who have lost their loved ones.
Our thoughts are also with the rescue forces, the firefighters and policemen who risked and lost their lives to save others.
What the world witnessed yesterday - and there are no other words to express it - was a crime against humanity.
As soon as the terrorists are identified, they should be brought to an international court for crimes against humanity and judged accordingly.
This is the time to speed up the establishment of a permanent international criminal court.
In the aftermath of this tragedy, the United States of America should also recognise the need for such an institution.
If, on the other hand, the United States responds with attacks on possible suspect countries, they will not only be killing more innocent people, just like those who died so tragically on Tuesday, but they will also be encouraging further counter-attacks: two wrongs never make a right.
The devastating consequences of a spiral of revenge are nowhere more visible today than in the Middle East.
We should do everything possible to ensure that this attitude is not repeated on a global scale.
I would like to express our deep concern about the situation in the Middle East and call for international efforts to bring the peace negotiations back on track to be intensified.
In this regard, we welcome the clear commitment made along those lines by Belgian Foreign Minister, Mr Louis Michel, in today' s press and as representative of the Presidency-in-Office of the European Union.
We need to be tough on terrorism, but we also need to be tough on the causes of terrorism.
We need a political response on a global scale to this unprecedented challenge in order to weed out the real roots of terrorism which stem from political, social and environmental conflicts: this concept underlies the report of Mr Watson, which this Parliament adopted last week.
If there is widespread fanaticism, which breeds and supports this sort of terrorism, we can assume that there is something wrong politically.
The European Union is well placed to engage in forms of conflict prevention and conflict resolution which address the causes and not merely treat the symptoms.
That is why we believe a European Union/United States Summit should be held to deal with all aspects of the new terrorist threats, including the social and political causes.
On Tuesday, our sense of security was shown to be illusory.
It became evident that high-tech measures, such as a missile defence system, would be powerless in the face of this new kind of low-tech terrorism.
What has happened in New York and Washington cannot be allowed to ever happen again.
All defenders of democracy must protect our precious civilisation and uphold the civilised rule of law.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, none of us, in fact, have the words to express the feelings aroused by the terrorist attack of unprecedented barbarity with which the United States has just been hit.
The American people is going to have to live through a deeply traumatic experience which is likely to become still more intense as the scale of the disaster they have just experienced becomes more apparent.
In this unimaginable ordeal, they must be able to count upon our unqualified solidarity.
I would add that, if these faceless monsters targeted the United States yesterday, they will be able, tomorrow, to bring terror and death to any region of the world, including, of course, the European continent.
Madam President, my group therefore fully supports the declarations you have made and the steps you have taken on our behalf.
These dismaying attacks constitute a challenge to the whole of the human community, a challenge we are now going to have to learn to take up.
I say 'learn' because, if we all agree that the guilty parties must be found and punished, we are obliged to acknowledge that, where every other aspect of the matter is concerned, more questions than certainties arise out of the tragedy of 11 September 2001.
In my view, nothing would be more inappropriate, indeed more dangerous, than to react to this radically new phenomenon with well-worn notions whose limitations have just been cruelly demonstrated.
After an outrage of this kind, there may, in other words, be a great temptation to call fervently for violent retaliation which would, however, have immeasurable consequences.
What is more, you are right, Mr Poettering. It would do no service to the cause of peace to allow criminal fanatics to be confused with entire peoples, a number of whose representatives have, sometimes with much dignity and in a deep spirit of responsibility, indeed just expressed both their radical condemnation of the terrorists and their solidarity with the American people.
Finally, and in more general terms, no one must forget ever again that we are all part of the same world.
Even the strongest nation of all is not invulnerable.
The entire international community is sentenced to confronting together the great problems facing the planet - the oceans of frustration, the great divisions that are opening up and the negotiations that have broken down - and to cooperating as closely as possible in the search for long-term solutions.
That is undoubtedly the decisive contribution that Europe can make to the world in order to join in taking up the challenge to civilisation facing us.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, Prime Minister, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the initial thoughts which we have to express at this time are feelings of compassion towards the victims and of solidarity with the American people.
The terrorist attack of which they have been the victims is not only aimed at themselves.
It is directed at the very heart of democracy itself.
Democracies are fragile things, and we are well aware that they have difficulty confronting this type of action.
In the light of history and of experience, however, I remain convinced of the American people' s ability to come through this ordeal and, at this time, I believe it is important for this House to express its solidarity with them.
That being the case, I should like to thank you, Madam President, for having organised this meeting which my group, in common with others, had requested.
I am glad that it is taking place. I hope that it will be followed by a debate enabling us to examine the problems posed by international terrorism in greater depth.
Having, on two occasions, had responsibility for leading the fight against terrorism in my own country, I should like to say that there is, to start with, one false notion that it is necessary to get away from: that there are good terrorists and bad terrorists. There are not; there are only terrorists, full stop.
(Loud applause)
In so far as it involves a minority trying to use force and violent action to impose its point of view on the greatest number of people, terrorism is never anything other than a manifestation of the fascism and totalitarianism which we have fought in the past and which we must continue to combat resolutely.
However, the fight against terrorism presupposes a state of permanent mobilisation, and it is probably because we have rather lost sight of this idea and this obvious fact that we are now confronted with the tragic situation we see in the United States.
I think that the United States has made the mistake of believing it is probably immune from this type of action.
We in Europe have, unfortunately, already experienced such acts: in Germany, Italy, France, Spain and many other countries.
We know that terrorism is a blind force that can strike anywhere and at any time.
We also know that political will is needed in order to combat terrorism. This will must be affirmed.
Cooperation is also required.
If each State wishes to reserve for itself the information it has managed to obtain and if there is no real cooperation at all between the services concerned, then we will be heading for further disasters.
If, on the other hand, there is a new awareness on the part of our countries and at the level of international cooperation, if there is the will to pool all the information that may be to hand and if, also, a decision is made to create, in one form or another, a permanent body for cooperation, with the ability to analyse this information and propose the necessary measures, then we shall have the opportunity to oppose terrorism with some success.
I should like, for my part too, to concur with what has been said in this House, firstly by our excellent fellow Member, Mr Poettering, and then by Mrs Hautala and Mr Wurtz.
There would be nothing worse at the present time than to speak in such thoughtless terms as to create a sense of solidarity between terrorists and the Muslim world.
That would be the worst of mistakes and the most stupid thing of all to do.
That is why, of course, none of us can be satisfied with declarations that do not mean very much.
I personally think, however, that I - indeed, our Community as a whole - would consider it to be of great value if Muslim religious leaders at the highest level were themselves to condemn these attacks and in that way demonstrate that terrorists proclaiming a perverted faith cannot possibly be identified with, or thought to share any common ground with, the Muslim religion, which deserves the respect of each one of us.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, I shall speak on behalf of the radical delegation.
I would first of all like to thank the Belgian presidency for their initiative on Friday.
I believe that it is all the more necessary since, while the majority of us feel great emotion and great compassion for our American friends, there are those who are saving their emotion and their compassion for the possible American reprisals.
I therefore warmly thank you.
I believe that we have a reason which has not been mentioned here today, another reason to feel compassion for our American friends, and that is that if it is they who have been attacked today, and not us, it is probably due to the lack of courage of our policy, to its ambiguities and its hypocrisies, which have not been demonstrated by our American friends.
Mr Poettering, you rightly talk about the need to confront the causes of terrorism, and I believe that it is crucial for the European Union to examine its policy over the last fifty years, which has been fundamentally racist in relation to the Arab world and the Islamic world, a policy which has done nothing but sustain the worst regimes in those countries, the worst regimes of Saddam Hussein, of Mr Gaddafi, of Mr Hafez El-Assad in the past and his son today, a policy which has hardly shown solidarity with past and present democrats, such as Mrs Ben Sedrin in Tunisia, Mrs Al-Sadaawi in Egypt, Mr Ibrahimi in Egypt, and so many others who fight for democracy in their countries, and I believe that it is a matter of urgency for our Union to make the establishment of democracy in those countries its political priority, since that is the only way to pursue and destroy the terrorist bases in those countries.
Terrorism does not come from the Moon. It is born and grows up in those countries which encourage it, which often finance it, and which are responsible for the fact that yesterday we saw the greatest tragedy since the end of the second world war, the greatest ever terrorist tragedy.
I would like to assure the Commission and the Council that I believe our Parliament must completely alter its position.
It has literally been taken hostage over recent months by certain crypto-Stalinists who have pushed it into excessively Palestinian unilateral positions which certainly have some connection with the current tragedy of our American friends.
We must finally have the courage to break the taboos.
We have an historic duty in relation to Israel, but we also have a duty in the present.
Israel is the only true democracy in that part of the world.
We must break the taboo.
Israel must be part of the European Union.
That is the only way to guarantee security and democracy in that country.
But it is also the only way to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to guarantee secure borders for the Israelis, and therefore for the Palestinians.
Furthermore, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is intolerable that the democracies of the world continue to be made fools of, and Mr Louis Michel, our President-in-Office, has borne the brunt of this in Durban.
I thank Mr Michel for his determination and for the resolute fight he put up in Durban, but it is intolerable that the Syrian regime should do what it did in Durban.
Our democracies must create and organise themselves into a worldwide organisation of democracies, so that the empty shell known as the UN may recover its original purpose, which is to resolve the great problems of the world.
Madam President, dear American friends, our sympathy is with the many families who are now missing their loved ones.
Our tears are shed today for those who have lost a son or a daughter, a mother, a father, or both.
Our prayers are with those who are still alive but remain in peril.
Our thoughts are with President Bush and the people he leads.
Our hope is that in the pain of these terrible atrocities, the reaction of the American people will be tempered with wisdom.
Even as we weep, we know that this is not a time for hatred and revenge.
This a moment of truth, a time for reflection for all of us.
We only have one world and we are all responsible for it and its people.
World peace is something of which we all dream, but we have learned through bitter experience that it was not enough simply to tear down the wall between East and West.
We have learned that it is not only the superpowers who can acquire the methods and means of mass destruction.
Small, faceless groups intent on destruction have it within their power to destroy our whole world.
The answer is not only improved intelligence and sophisticated security.
The way to world peace is to work for it by respecting human rights and the right to national self-determination for all.
We must fight torture, terrorism and every crime against humanity.
We must take sustainable development seriously.
We must help the poor, the oppressed and the powerless before they become desperate, suicidal terrorists.
Just as terror can never be justified, neither can oppression.
Oppression breeds people who are prepared to take all life before them in the passionate intensity of their hatred.
We must bridge the gap between the West and the rest of the world, instead of fighting each other.
In this way we may remove the raison d'etre of terrorism.
It is still too early to foresee all the lessons to be learned from Tuesday' s shocking event but it is not too early to know that Tuesday, 11 September 2001 marked a turning point in history.
Our world will never be the same again.
Our thoughts are with the victims of these horrendous attacks and those who grieve for them.
Let the memory of these terrible events always call to mind our duty to take better care of this world.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, on this tragic day, we wish to express our solidarity and our friendship towards the American people, victims of the most horrendous terrorist crime.
Nor do we forget that many nationals of European countries work in the towers of the World Trade Centre, and that many of them have certainly died.
We have a profound feeling that it is not just the United States, but the whole of the Western world, of which we form an integral part, which has been targeted.
It is not in fact just the United States, but the whole of Western civilisation that has just been the victim of an act of war, of a new war, which is murderous but elusive, because it does not correspond to any traditional criteria.
Some people believed, after the fall of the Soviet Union, that the world was becoming less dangerous, and that was an easy excuse to relax the security effort.
That was a grave error.
In fact, we have entered a new era, in which there is a greater risk from rogue States led by people driven mad and blinded by hate and ideology.
Worse still, more elusive than the rogue States are the stateless terrorist organisations whose murderous folly does not correspond to any logic.
This new war is going to force us to review all our strategic ideas.
Firstly, Europe is going to have to understand that security must take priority over abolishing controls at borders and elsewhere.
I shall not dwell on this point, which you all understand.
Secondly, we must strengthen our fight against terrorism and criminal organisations through European cooperation and worldwide cooperation on the exchange of information and on action, but also by first of all putting our own countries in order.
It is terrifying to imagine what ideas may be implanted in other places by the attacks which have just been inflicted on the world' s most powerful country.
Thirdly, we must re-establish the defence effort where it has been relaxed, as it has in my country over recent years.
The threat is real and takes many forms.
The rapid reaction force set up by the countries of Europe is a good idea, provided that its democratic control, its variable geometry and the freedom of engagement of the members are better respected than they are at the moment, as can already be said.
But, above all, it is insufficient.
While seeking to eradicate terrorism, as you have said, Madam President, we must simultaneously make our territories safer in order to better protect our people.
In order to make our territories safer, all useful means must be implemented.
One of these is the idea that President Bush launched some time ago, which is an anti-missile shield for the United States.
The Europeans, for their part, took a rather negative view of this idea.
Today, we must review this issue.
Would it not also be in the interest of Europe to conduct studies into the possibility of having its own shield, alone or in cooperation with the United States?
That remains to be seen.
It would not protect against attacks such as yesterday' s, of course, but it would protect against other risks which we are obliged to anticipate.
Neither, of course, do we currently have the necessary technological means, but the quest to acquire them would be a challenge worthy of consideration.
That would undoubtedly be a European-scale project, Madam President, which would no doubt be a powerful demonstration to the public of the usefulness of respectful cooperation between national sovereign states, which is intended to protect them.
Ladies and gentlemen, today we have wished to hold a formal sitting.
We shall consider, together with the Group Chairmen, the possibility of organising a major fundamental debate at our part-session next week.
I should also like to say that I naturally take a very positive view of the suggestion made to me to establish a book of condolence addressed to our colleagues in the American Congress.
That book will be placed at the exit of the Chamber tomorrow morning at 10.00 a.m.
I should like to offer my most heartfelt thanks to Prime Minister Verhofstadt, to Minister Louis Michel, to Mr Romano Prodi, and to all of you, and declare this formal sitting closed.
(The sitting was closed at 6.10 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament, adjourned on Wednesday 12 September 2001.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sittings
The Minutes of the sittings of Thursday 6 and Wednesday 12 September 2001 have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Madam President, although I know that we have more important things to do today, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, on 6 September, I raised objections to the Minutes of the previous day and also asked - with a view to having these issues in general clarified, and not just this particular instance - that the committee responsible for dealing with agenda questions be asked to look into the matter of a vote result being retrospectively altered.
Towards midday, I raised another objection and referred to my first one, but I have to date received no reply, and I do think that a Member is entitled to be given answers.
So I ask you firstly: do you think that a Member is entitled to be given answers when he raises objections?
And secondly: when can I expect to receive one?
Yes, Mr Swoboda, of course.
I believe that Members are entitled to receive a reply to their comments and I can assure you that this matter will be sorted out.
Madam President, of course Mr Swoboda is entitled to receive an accurate reply.
I just want to ask your services to give it on the basis of the midday debate.
Not to be too blunt about it, I had the feeling that Mr Swoboda, on the day itself, tried to use an amendment of the Minutes to change the outcome of this House's vote.
For this reason, I ask that the midday debate should be taken as the basis of any answer your services give to Mr Swoboda, and please be so kind as to let me have a copy of it.
I am quite sure that your services understood perfectly well what this House had in mind!
Mr Jarzembowski, we shall look into the whole matter very carefully.
(The Minutes were approved)
Tribute
Ladies and gentlemen, Commander Massoud visited the European Parliament on 4 April 2001.
He was recently assassinated in a cowardly attack by his opponents, a few days before the terrible attacks on New York and Washington.
I had invited him because he embodied the hopes of the overwhelming majority of people in Afghanistan for a future of peace and freedom.
He had warned us against the Taliban regime' s tacit support for international terrorism and he did everything in his power to fight against those who misused Islam in order to flout the most basic human rights.
He sent a strong message to us to help him to establish peace as soon as possible.
I regret that the West did not heed this message and did not do more to help this brave man.
Many of you met him and were impressed by his intellect and his human qualities.
I would like to ask you to pay tribute to him by observing a minute' s silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Statement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to a communication that I shall now give to you on security measures at the European Parliament.
As you know, the dreadful terrorist attacks in the United States have fuelled quite legitimate feelings of concern within the European Parliament itself.
The Sunday Telegraph even reported that we were the target of very serious threats, which had been thwarted.
I would like to confirm that the European Parliament has never known of any threats.
On Monday, the prefect of the Bas Rhin department called me personally in order to tell me that he formally denied that these threats had been made.
As you know, the French authorities also formally denied the threats, as confirmed in an official press release.
I would add that the British Secret Services also claimed that they had no knowledge of them.
In fact, I intend to send a letter to the editor of the Sunday Telegraph to protest against the newspaper publishing such serious and inaccurate information.
I can assure you, however, that the staff of the Bureau are constantly monitoring the issue of security of the European Parliament, the vice-presidents, the Quaestors, the President and General Secretariat.
We took a number of measures to increase security, particularly in December 2000, at Christmas, when there were rumours circulating that Strasbourg cathedral was a target.
Given that the cathedral is close by, a series of measures was of course taken at that time.
Immediately after the events of 11 September, the Secretary-General and I were in contact, and we have introduced additional measures to further increase checks on people and luggage at the entrances of the three European Parliament buildings.
I would add that we are, of course, in constant contact with the other European institutions as well as with the governments of the host countries of the European Parliament.
Lastly, the Bureau is meeting this evening in order to consider a series of new measures proposed by the Secretary-General which aim to extend - and I did say 'extend' - security measures.
I trust everyone will cooperate so these necessary measures are a success. Thank you in advance.
Welcome
It is my pleasure to welcome Mr Moussa Touré, President of West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA), who is seated in the public gallery.
The UEMOA, whose structure is closely modelled on that of the European Union, plays a key role in the organisation of regional cooperation in West Africa.
This is why we hope to build further on the links that already exist between this organisation and the European Union.
This is the aim of Mr Touré' s visit, and I would like to extend a very warm welcome to him.
Combating terrorism
I would like to welcome Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, Minister for European Affairs and President-in-Office of the Council.
I would also like to welcome Commissioner Vitorino.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements with a view to the informal and extraordinary meeting of the European Council on Friday 21 September, on the measures needed to tackle terrorism.
I shall now give the floor to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe, its citizens and its institutions are still deeply shocked by the terrorist attack on the United States on Tuesday 11 September 2001.
The Presidency and the Council immediately condemned, in the strongest possible terms, the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of these barbaric acts.
The strikes against the American nation are a direct attack on the values of democracy, tolerance, respect for human rights and the rule of law that are shared by America and Europe, and upon which our societies and others elsewhere in the world, are based.
At its emergency session on Wednesday 12 September, the Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers expressed its profound solidarity with the American people.
We clearly stated that no effort would be spared to identify, bring to justice and punish those responsible.
To achieve this aim, the European Union will have to use and strengthen a number of operational instruments of our Common Foreign and Security Policy and our Justice and Home Affairs policy.
Terrorism is an international problem and as such requires a global response.
Madam President, at the instigation of the General Affairs Council, the Council of Transport Ministers held a meeting on 14 September.
The Council reviewed the urgent measures taken by each Member State in order to guarantee the safety of air travel.
It also set up a special working group, comprising representatives of the Member States and of the European Commission, which is responsible for increasing cooperation and coordination among the Member States to ensure the uniform and effective application of security measures, including by legislative means.
A preliminary report on this subject is to be laid before the Council of Transport Ministers meeting scheduled for 15 October next.
Lastly, the Transport Ministers have decided to draw up common proposals on the subject of security measures.
On behalf of the Union, these proposals will then be put to the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation on 25 September next.
The Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers will meet on 20 September.
It will assess the intelligence-sharing mechanism and the respective roles in this context of institutions such as Europol and Eurojust, as well as assessing the two proposals for framework decisions it received from the Commission.
The first proposal concerns the approximation of criminal law in the Member States with a view to developing a common definition of terrorist action and establishing a common system for punishing criminal acts.
The second proposal concerns the introduction of a European warrant of arrest.
The Council will consider instruments employed in the investigation of criminal acts and will ensure that a suitable balance is struck between the protection of privacy and the needs of the investigative authorities.
Finally, the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers will examine a number of measures aimed at strengthening transatlantic judicial cooperation in the areas of policing, intelligence and immigration.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against terrorism requires the use of all kinds of instruments to monitor financial flows, to identify suspects, to make air travel safer, to monitor arms trafficking as well as many other aspects.
The European Union is the best placed organisation to provide a global response to the fight against terrorism.
The fight against international terrorism will be a long, drawn-out battle.
As the Heads of State and Governments have stated, the European Union will have to assume an even greater role in managing regional tension and conflicts if it is to stamp out international terrorism.
The inclusion of fragile nations and regions in a peaceful world governed by the rule of law will be a powerful weapon in the battle against the scourge of terrorism.
The EU will be much more effective if it can further develop its Common, Foreign and Security Policy and can activate its Common European Security Policy at the earliest opportunity.
The Common, Foreign and Security Policy will have to be used preventatively, rather than as a means of reprisal.
If the battle against terrorism is to be truly effective, we will also need to strengthen our policies with regard to the countries and the regions of the world that appear to nurture terrorism.
We will have to enhance and deepen our political dialogue and use every possible means at our disposal to combat, stifle and finally eradicate international terrorism.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is an emerging world power.
As such we have a greater number of responsibilities, which we must shoulder together.
The tragic events of 11 September 2001 will also prompt us to develop closer ties with the United States, which will go beyond the established mechanisms for cooperation.
The transatlantic dialogue will enable us to exchange information and share our respective assessments of the threat posed by terrorism, in all its guises.
The Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister, Louis Michel, will travel to Washington this evening for talks with the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, on transatlantic cooperation.
He will report back on his meeting to the extraordinary meeting of the European Council, which is scheduled for Friday 21 September.
This extraordinary meeting of the European Council was called to review all the political, diplomatic, economic, legal and financial resources that are at the Union' s disposal to combat terrorism.
The Council will also be an opportunity to reflect on the EU' s diplomatic role in stabilising regional conflicts.
In order to be effective, the fight against terrorism must be able to rely on the efforts of all the countries that share our values of freedom, tolerance and democracy.
For this reason, the Presidency has sought to ensure that third countries are fully involved in the actions taken by the European Union.
The candidate countries unanimously backed the declarations of the General Affairs Council and the declarations made by the Heads of State and Government.
Third countries have also been invited, via the foreign embassies of Member States, to confirm their commitment to the unrelenting fight against terrorism.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union can thus help to build a world of peace and legality for all nations.
(Applause)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is actively preparing for the European Council meeting to be held next Friday, an important part of which is tomorrow' s European Union troika meeting in the United States.
This is why my colleague Chris Patten, who hoped to give a speech on external relations with particular emphasis on the fight against terrorism, could not attend this debate.
On behalf of the Commission, I would like to stress that we support the principle that the Union must make more effort to give a consistent message where the fight against terrorism is concerned and that we need a European agenda to acknowledge the key role that must be assigned to the United Nations Organisation in the fight against global terrorism.
That is why we welcome the initiative by the Belgian Presidency to schedule an extraordinary and informal meeting of the European Council for next Friday and we are pleased to take part in today' s debate in the European Parliament.
We must show the American people and the American authorities that they have the solidarity of the whole European Union.
But in order for the Union to influence the guidelines on the fight against terrorism, we must give a consistent message.
Terrorism is not a recent phenomenon.
The threats are new, however, and the tools used by the terrorists are new and more sophisticated.
The tragic events in the United States of America sadly demonstrate the timeliness of the two proposals that were today approved by the Commission, which are closely related and which are also in response to a request by the European Parliament that was approved at the September plenary session in Strasbourg.
I would like to clarify that our proposals are not a response to the events that occurred in the United States of America.
The proposals are primarily a response to the fact that, even in our Member States, we have problems regarding terrorism that we must resolve.
The Commission has been working on these proposals for more than a year, working closely with the European Parliament, and we would like to stress that these proposals will help Europe to co-operate in a much more effective manner in the fight against terrorism, and therefore to collaborate in the fight at international level.
Terrorism constitutes one of the greatest threats to democracy, to the free exercise of human rights and free economic and social development.
In recent years, we have witnessed an increase in terrorist activities both within the European Union' s borders and worldwide.
This increase in the power of terrorism is characterised by a profound change in the nature of terrorist attacks.
The actual or potential effects of armed attacks are increasingly devastating and fatal.
The increased dependence of our society on technological evolutions is giving rise to new forms of terrorism.
Increasingly, terrorism stems from the activities of networks operating at international level, which have very close links with other types of organised crime based in several countries, exploiting the legal loopholes arising from the geographical limits of investigations and sometimes enjoying extensive logistical and financial support.
Today more than any other time, therefore, we need measures to fight against this scourge.
The Treaty on European Union expressly lays down that the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice shall include progressively adopting measures establishing rules relating to the constituent elements of criminal acts and to penalties in the field of terrorism.
The European Parliament recently adopted a resolution, which shows the determination of representatives of European citizens to conduct a fierce and effective battle against terrorism.
The Commission is proposing a two-fold response:
First of all, we are proposing a common definition of acts of terrorism and to set across the Member States levels of penalties that reflect the seriousness of these acts.
Terrorists take advantage of any differences in legal treatment in the Member States, particularly where the offence is not referred to in one of the State' s national legislation.
We must admit that the situation is very different from one Member State to another.
Most Member States have no specific regulations on terrorism and terrorist acts are punished as common offences.
On the other hand, six Member States have specific laws or legal instruments concerning terrorism where the words 'terrorism' or 'terrorist' are expressly mentioned.
The Commission' s proposal for a framework decision on terrorism aims to introduce approximation in this area and it provides a list of offences from murder to other actions that can be equally devastating, albeit more insidious, and which are described as terrorist acts if intentionally committed by individuals or by groups against one or more countries, their institutions or people, with the aim of intimidating them and seriously altering or destroying the political, economic or social structures of a country or to destroy them.
It is proposed that such acts incur prison sentences ranging from a minimum of 2 years to 20 years of prison depending on the severity of the offence.
Secondly, the Commission is presenting a proposal of a horizontal nature, a fairly ambitious proposal, I must admit, which is to replace the traditional extradition procedures by a system of surrendering persons to judicial authorities on the basis of a European arrest warrant.
This proposal, which also supplements the proposal on terrorism although its scope is wider, is based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments, which the Tampere European Council hoped would become the cornerstone of European judicial cooperation.
The underlying idea is that where the judicial authority of one Member State requests the surrender of a person, either for final sentencing or because this person is undergoing criminal proceedings, the decision must be recognised and executed throughout the European Union in order to simplify and accelerate procedures as far as possible.
A time limit of three months is proposed and the reasons for refusing extradition are to be restricted to a limited number.
In particular, the principle of double criminal liability and the exception in favour of nationals are to be abolished.
The most important criterion in the European Union is not that of nationality but that of a person' s place of residence.
The proposal thus seeks to facilitate, wherever possible, the execution of the sentence in the country of arrest, if that is where the person is most likely to be successfully reintegrated into society.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, tomorrow I shall have the opportunity to present these proposals to the ministers at the extraordinary Council meeting called by the Belgian Presidency to discuss the European Union' s contribution to the fight against the threat of terrorism.
The benefit of this meeting is that it provides us with the opportunity to ask the ministers questions of principle at a political level and to try to resolve them.
This concerns our legislative proposals as well as a whole raft of measures that should be taken in order to step up our action at an operational level and to improve and make more effective our collaboration with our partners.
As you know, the Commission does not have any experience at an operational level, but it believes that the European Union should take a number of measures internally, including to ensure that Europol becomes an operational instrument in the fight against the various forms of crime, one of which is terrorism.
For this to be done, we must implement the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam on Europol, which provide for its participation in joint enquiry teams and the possibility of inviting Member States to launch investigations, which also requires a major review of the content of the Europol convention, including questions of judicial control and democratic control.
We need strong commitment from the Member States straight away in order to establish genuine and effective cooperation between their intelligence services and to demonstrate that they share mutual trust.
This is also necessary in order to bring about a significant improvement in the conditions in which Member States' police and intelligence services provide Europol with the information needed to carry out their work, the most important part of which, in my opinion, is the prevention of terrorist acts.
Furthermore, it is important for the Union to strengthen international cooperation and this will involve taking all the necessary measures regarding judicial assistance, extradition, police and judicial cooperation in order to improve our ability to pre-empt and fight international terrorism.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, these are some ideas formulated by the Commission and which were put to the European Parliament and the European Council.
At this difficult time when the citizens of our Member States are, I am sure, contemplating an uncertain and insecure future, I believe that the best political message we can give them is that this gives us a unique opportunity to show that the European project really does have an added value and that is to guarantee them a future of freedom, security and justice.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats greatly welcomes the special summit of Heads of State and Government to be held on Friday at the Belgian Presidency's initiative, and you, Madam President, will of course be there too, to speak for the European Parliament.
We in the European Parliament can take real pride in passing the Watson Report in the last part-session; it points the way ahead for our common struggle against terrorism.
Next Friday's summit here in Brussels should, in many ways, be a signal.
It should again signal to our American friends that the diabolical attacks on Washington and New York were not only an assault on the United States, but on the whole of the civilised world and on every one of us.
These attacks struck at our ideals of democracy, human rights and peace.
What was said in our deeply moving session last week is still true today.
In the Conference of Presidents this morning, I asked the High Representative, Mr Solana - who is at this very moment on his way to Washington with Mr Michel and Mr Patten - to tell Secretary of State Powell, when they meet, that we, the freely-elected Parliament of Europeans in the European Union, expressed our solidarity in the immediate aftermath of these fearful events.
In Washington, however, we will also say that we expect not only decisions to be announced there for our European leaders to take note of, but also genuine discussions and consultation to take place, so that whatever action is necessary, and responsibility for it, may be shared by Europeans and Americans.
Madam President, I have the highest respect for Mr Solana.
In future, however, we must ensure that we can debate with the High Representative of the European Union here in the European Parliament as well.
I believe there is room for improvement here.
Friday's summit must also send a signal to the Middle East.
We urge Israel and the Palestinians to hold talks now.
Now is not the time to refuse to hold talks, or to cancel them, but a time for dialogue and confidence-building measures, so that peace may be achieved there.
(Applause)
We must repeat: those who now refuse dialogue shut themselves out from our sympathy and solidarity.
At this time most of all, we need peace developments and confidence-building measures in the Middle East.
(Applause)
We need a signal to the Arabic and Islamic world.
Our group's Bureau met this morning and decided to recommend to you, Madam President, that we should, as a European Parliament, meet as soon as possible with parliamentarians from the Arabic and Islamic world in the context of the Mediterranean Forum, that is to say, with those States with which we are linked in the Barcelona process and in the Mediterranean Dialogue.
Allow us now to send this signal, so that they may know that we seek partnership and friendship.
Let me now turn to another aspect, which I believe must be the essential operational content of the summit here in Brussels on Friday.
Mr Vitorino, we thank you for presenting these proposals today.
We must make Europol into a real instrument for combating crime, and we urge Member States to give Europol the information it needs to do this, something which has not happened in the past.
As we know, only one Member State does this reasonably adequately at present; the others have to date refused to.
We are very much in favour of introducing a European arrest warrant, and now is the time to act.
If there is anyone who now wants to stop Europeans going from strength to strength, who does not support European cooperation in the name of Europol, then they are fundamentally denying solidarity not only to Europeans, but also to our American friends, because in combating crime we must also be united against terrorism, if we are to stand alongside our American friends and partners.
(Applause)
For this reason, our group has tabled an amendment to the Budget for the year 2002.
We want to put the necessary resources at Europol's disposal to enable it to be truly operationally effective.
The time for words is now past!
We must act as Europeans.
At the same time, however, we must act calmly and with deliberation, and above all we must resolve conflicts peacefully wherever we can.
A military operation is never an act of retaliation, but must always lead to greater security.
Let us act calmly and with deliberation, but let us act consistently, and above all let us make our contribution to the peaceful coexistence of the peoples of the Earth!
(Applause)
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, last week we formally expressed our sympathies for all the victims of these attacks, who came from America, Europe and the whole of the world; we expressed our solidarity with the United States and, now, with pain but also with determination, we must respond to global terrorism, to this mixture of fanaticism and advanced technology which threatens our civilisation and our open, democratic and multicultural society.
We must send a very clear message to our fellow citizens: terrorism can injure, it can kill, but no democracy has ever been destroyed by terrorism and that is our greatest strength.
We must therefore work together: Parliament produced the Watson report, the Commission has speeded up its work and this week a Special Council has been called.
I must stress that yesterday and today the President-in-Office of the Council, the Belgian Minister for External Affairs, Mr Michel, the High Representative for the CFSP, Mr Solana, and the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Patten, have taken part in debates in Parliament on this issue.
I believe that we should welcome this willingness to participate, which increases transparency and communication.
We Socialists must respond on the basis of one fundamental notion: the global response must be based on United Nations Security Council Resolution 1368 of this year, which establishes that we must work together to bring the organisers, sponsors and perpetrators of the attacks and their accomplices to justice.
This is the basis of the worldwide coalition which we are building with the United States, with the candidate countries, with Russia and with all the states of the world which share our universal values.
I would add another point: the ratification of the International Criminal Court must be accelerated so that we may have a global instrument of justice in this very field.
We must also work firmly and with perseverance, acting within the framework of a multidimensional policy which relates to what we are doing in the United Nations.
This explains NATO' s decision to invoke Article 5.
We must state that poverty, injustice or conflict are not causes which can justify barbarism.
No conflict between East and West, between Islam and Christianity, between the traditional and the modern, can explain why killing innocent people can bring progress in the world.
I believe that the European Parliament, those of us sitting here from different peoples, of different beliefs, ideologies and religions, demonstrates that we Europeans have found a response to fanaticism and intolerance.
What can be done to create our policy? A series of contributions have been made here.
The Commission has brought forward certain measures and there are others which the Commission and the Council could activate more quickly. For example, they could speed up the implementation of the conclusions of the Tampere Summit and the application of the Treaty of Amsterdam, they could speed up the ratification of the international conventions against terrorism - and this also falls within the competence of the Member States - and in particular the convention for the suppression of terrorist funding.
It must not be the case, as appears to be happening, that we are assisting in the funding of terrorist organisations through stock exchange speculation.
There must also be increasing cooperation between intelligence services and a strengthening of Europol.
Finally, Madam President - and this must be stressed - on the basis of the information given us by Mr Solana this morning, we must activate and pursue our policy of finding an opening, an opportunity, for peace in the Middle East, founded on the Mitchell report.
Confidence-building measures must not be viewed as recompense, but rather such measures must be an integral part of this process.
And we must do so jointly with the United States.
We must send them the message that they should not hide behind imaginary shields, that they should share with us in the responsibility to achieve a world which lives in peace, justice, freedom and security.
(Applause)
Madam President, last week's attacks on innocent civilians in New York and Washington shocked and outraged the civilised people across the world.
They show the difficulties faced by any state, especially a democracy, in defending its citizens against terrorists.
These atrocities and the subsequent search for those responsible also highlight the weaknesses of our defence of the civilian population and throw into sharp relief the painfully slow progress of EU cooperation in justice and home affairs, so boldly trumpeted in Amsterdam and in Tampere.
As the Americans seek the arrest of people on European soil who may be responsible, they must shake their heads in disbelief at the multitude of bilateral extradition agreements, which they will need to employ.
I welcome Commissioner Vitorino's statement.
The proposals he has put forward today take on board the key recommendations of the report we adopted on 5 September, to which Mr Poettering so kindly referred.
They deserve urgent consideration and swift action by Justice and Home Affairs Ministers at their meeting tomorrow.
If they are adopted by Council, they will represent a major step forward in forging a common EU anti-terrorism policy.
I challenge any minister who may resist these proposals in the secrecy of the Council chamber to explain publicly to citizens in their own country, or across Europe, why they are holding up effective common action in this field.
However welcome and important the Commission's proposals are, they are clearly insufficient.
They provide answers to the world as it was before last Tuesday.
They deal with terrorist crimes within the Union but do nothing to improve cooperation with countries outside the EU.
They fail to solve conflicts of competence between judicial authorities.
They leave cooperation and the vital matter of police affairs subject to a national veto, as Commissioner Vitorino said.
If the EU is serious about combating terrorism, we must gear up the operational instruments of common action.
We must enable Europol to cooperate effectively with third countries.
We must give an external dimension to Eurojust.
We must act decisively too, to combat money laundering in the conciliation currently under way and we must develop common policies for the collection and sharing of criminal intelligence, as Mrs Neyts pointed out.
Measures are needed too in foreign and security policy: greater cooperation in the UN, in the G8, in the Council of Europe, urging Member States to sign the UN Convention on the financing of terrorism; export controls on sensitive products and tighter association agreements with third countries.
But we must guard against a blurring of the second and the third pillars, which last week's Council declaration suggested, and guard too against upsetting the delicate balance between the needs of security and the civil liberties, which our citizens enjoy.
I ask whether now is not the time to consign to the rubble of history the clumsy, outdated second and third pillars of the EU cooperation and make their contents core competences of the European Union.
(Applause)
The fig leaf of national sovereignty serves only to hide the impotence of nation states.
Democracy faces supranational challenges and these require a supranational response.
Our policies will need public support, so our policymaking will need proper democratic oversight and control.
I believe that this House stands ready to play its part.
We must now call on our national leaders to show the courage and the vision which the moment demands.
(Applause)
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, my group and I believe, in the wake of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, that the need to see the European Union display its character and show how useful it can be in world affairs has never been so great.
The coming period - perhaps the next few days - will certainly provide it with the opportunity to display its determination and ability to face three challenges, in particular, which are posed by this tragic situation.
I believe that the first challenge will be for countries to decide to be willing partners of the United States.
At yesterday' s debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, one of my colleagues spoke of 'allied but not aligned countries' .
This does not mean, of course, that they lack the necessary and legitimate solidarity, particularly in the common fight to seek out, judge and punish those responsible for this act of barbarism or, more generally, to break up the terrorist networks.
On the other hand, this means that we must have the courage to make clear to our American counterparts what we are perfectly willing to do and what do not sanction under any circumstances.
Yesterday and this morning, Mr Solana quite rightly stressed that it is vital that our fight against terrorism is not perceived by those in the Arab and Muslim world as a war against their civilisation, or even as a crusade, to use one of the most alarming expressions of President Bush.
Yesterday, the High Representative for the CFSP already recommended, in the same spirit, that we should be careful, that we should seek to humiliate nobody, avoid any confusion and not create rifts, which would be a huge mistake.
I welcome these responsible words.
My group hopes that these words will be translated into an outright refusal by the European Union to allow itself to be drawn into wartime thinking, into a trap which would produce more bloodshed and more innocent victims.
The second challenge that we must face is directly related to what I have just said.
We must avoid creating a division, but also review and revive the Euro-Mediterranean relationship.
Now is not the time, in my view, to discuss free-trade zones with our partners of the South-Eastern Mediterranean. We should instead talk about development, political dialogue, how to bring our societies closer and about human dignity.
And one of the practical commitments to make in line with this strategic choice is primarily to take concerted action to resolve the Middle East conflict fairly.
I appreciate the efforts made by Mr Solana and all the European Union representatives in the region.
These efforts are bearing initial fruit but we can all see that this situation is extremely fragile.
This is therefore the time to make every endeavour to work not against but in partnership with the United States and other actors, particularly in the region.
I believe that the third challenge we face is that of working on a new approach to international security.
Does the tragedy of 11 September not illustrate the failure of the way in which the world has been managed since the fall of the Berlin wall?
There are so many unresolved conflicts!
There are so many powerful but hidden forces at work!
There are so many destabilising forces!
Pursuing a unilateralist approach is not a response to this deep-rooted evil. We should combat it with genuine cooperation on a global scale which respects the spirit and letter of the United Nations Charter.
Taking military action or clamping down with law and order is not the way to respond. We need an ambitious and multi-faceted policy for crisis prevention.
Citizens everywhere - in Africa, in the Mediterranean, in Latin America, in Eastern Europe, in the United States itself and often in the Member States - expect to see a revision of world governance.
At the moment, Europe, in particular, is being called upon to do this.
This is an opportunity to be seized.
From this perspective, the coming days could be the moment of truth.
Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe that we have already had the opportunity to discuss the root of the problem in the past and that we will have further opportunities to do so in the future.
In this debate, therefore, I shall not discuss the general philosophy of the course of action to take.
I would simply like to reiterate a few points, which some of our leaders now seem to have forgotten.
We must realise that our first problem is identifying our enemy.
We must not have any illusions - there are Islamic fundamentalists that have decided to carry out attacks against Western democracies.
We must be aware of this.
You must also be aware that there are more or less dormant terrorist organisations in all of our countries and they could very easily become active overnight.
In this respect, I would like to add something to the extremely interesting comments and thoughts of Commissioner Vitorino, and that is I hope the European Union will cease to subsidise the States that harbour or assist terrorists.
I believe that this is a practical step that we ourselves could take and one that could be taken fairly swiftly.
My second point is that we very clearly cannot contemplate taking any action worthy of that name, unless there is also sincere political cooperation between States, first and foremost between Member States of the European Union.
I can remember a time, not so long ago, and I am not sure that this period is behind us, when the 'every man for himself' mentality still prevailed and we accepted the presence of some organisations on our own soil on the condition that no action would be taken, even if this meant action would be carried out in a neighbouring country.
I therefore feel that we must have true solidarity and it must be clearly expressed.
My third point is that I believe we must realise that, in order for action combating terrorism to be worthwhile, it must be preventive.
We must, therefore, enhance the work of the intelligence services.
I listened very carefully to everything that was said earlier about the need for Europol to be effective.
I am fully in favour of enhancing Europol' s effectiveness, but this will not enable you to begin fighting against terrorism instantly.
We need genuine, immediate cooperation between the intelligence and security services, a sincere exchange of information and for States to be able to take the necessary measures, whatever some States might think - and, for the moment, it is the States who are responsible for security as part of their cooperation.
I shall not elaborate any further.
That is what I wanted to say this evening and I would stress one thing. I have been listening to a philosophical debate on whether the action against the United States is an act of war or an act of terrorism.
Given the magnitude of these acts, I believe that they are acts of war.
And if we do not realise that they may well only be the first of many, then we will pay an extremely high price for our blindness.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic events of 11 September do not only implicate the criminal organisation that carried out these dramatic attacks to express its hatred of the West, but they also reveal that there is immense frustration towards US Middle East policy, which dates back as far as 1991.
The United States has already lost some of its prestige by attacking Iraq for poor strategic reasons, and by failing to secure a victory.
It is primarily the United States' systematic alignment with the State of Israel' s expansionist policy, and which the Americans had tried to compensate for by supporting extremist Islamic organisations, that has caused a sense of the most profound injustice to spread throughout the Arab countries.
This means that the policy of colonisation put in place after the Six Day War as well as the unjustified presence of American troops in the region are therefore condemned.
Unless the State of Israel gives up its racist policy and evacuates the settlements established on the West Bank of Jordan, the Arab world, in response to a legitimate appeal, will rise up and will destabilise the leaders of the Arab peninsula.
And why is such importance given to the State of Israel, which has excessive military capabilities and only exists because of the will of the United States?
It is out of the question for France and Europe to take part in a new crusade against the Arab world, whether this takes the form of military action, extraditions or European arrest warrants.
France is not a member of NATO and NATO is not concerned by Afghanistan.
On the contrary, France will find its strategic interests lie in resolutely supporting the Arab world in its fight against racism in the policy pursued by the State of Israel.
Mr President, it is terrible what happened in New York and Washington.
We share in the grief and suffering of America.
The full scale of what exactly has happened is only just hitting home.
Within the European Union, it will be necessary for us to develop an anti-terrorist policy in harmony with the United States.
We owe this to the victims and those left behind.
I would therefore like to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino on the speed with which proposals are now being submitted.
This fight is not a fight against Islam or its followers.
It is a fight against those who aim to reach their goals by terror, whatever so-called justification of their actions they try to put forward.
We must request unequivocally that all states and governments lend their unconditional support to this policy.
This fight is about the inviolability of human life as the highest value in our democracy.
I hope we can adopt this line in unison.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if we wish to make an effective contribution to the implementation of a global policy to fight international terrorism, as we say we do, the most effective way of doing this is surely to formally appeal to the Council to undertake an immediate examination of all the texts, particularly those which relate to the movement of people, from a security point of view rather than the perspective of the systematic abolition of checks.
However, this change of approach must apply to the forthcoming provisions and must also be evident through a systematic revision of the texts that have already been adopted, in the light of the need for the security and protection of our people, which is now a priority.
The Council must carry out this revision as soon as possible so that it can reform, and, if necessary, abolish all the provisions that may be used to establish and develop terrorist networks in our countries, whether they relate, for instance, to Community transit, border controls, family reunification or application for refugee status.
We cannot disregard the fact that people living on the fringes of the law are entering our countries and then also complain that terrorist networks are prospering on this breeding ground that we ourselves created.
We will have the opportunity tomorrow to align our actions with our words, since two reports are on the agenda, which contain recommendations that run counter to the requirement for security and for an anti-terrorism fight that we claim to want to prioritise.
We cannot possibly vote in favour of the Watson report, which has no explanatory statement, that dramatically widens the provisions on implementing the right to asylum, to the point where this essential right is changed beyond recognition and where the option to carry out checks is irresponsibly taken from Member States' authorities.
However, I would like to praise the courage of the first rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, who refused to have his name associated with such excesses.
In the same way, is this really the right time to adopt the Coelho report, the second paragraph of which calls on the United Kingdom and Ireland to abolish all their border controls as soon as possible?
Is this request not somewhat mistimed?
Ladies and gentlemen, we have the chance to be responsible and efficient by appealing to the Council to review our legislation in its entirety, in the light of the need for security.
Failing that, we can go into tomorrow' s debate trying not to be overly schizophrenic.
Mr President, as has been pointed out previously, we European citizens have witnessed, in astonishment and live on TV, a crime against humanity, as the president of my group pointed out, and an attempt to destroy our freedom and democracy.
The first thing we must do is to share in the pain of the American people.
Please allow me to say that we Spaniards fully understand the suffering of the victims.
But in the immediate aftermath we must react determinedly in order to defend our freedom and to do justice to the victims, showing the terrorists and their accomplices that their objectives have failed.
As in other eras of our history, it is essential that we reaffirm our democratic values in order to destroy the totalitarian course which terrorism takes us along.
The European Parliament has demonstrated its unequivocal commitment to combating terrorism, and the Watson report is a clear example of this.
But, now in particular, we must continue to put our political weight and impetus behind the concrete initiatives presented to us by the European Commission.
The President of my Group has presented certain budgetary initiatives aimed at strengthening the role of Europol.
Let us hope that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs - and I appeal to its Chairman - may, for its part, set an agenda allowing it to present to Parliament a proposal this year, which will allow the Belgian and Spanish Presidencies to finish their work in the coming months.
The European institutions have an inescapable responsibility to speed up procedures in order to provide the justice system with Community instruments which will make their work against terrorism and organised crime more effective.
The European Commission, and in particular Commissioner Vitorino, must be aware that it can count on the support of Parliament in order to guarantee concerted cooperation and action in tracking down these criminals, because this is the way to put an end to terror.
Mr President, as has been mentioned, on the 5th this Parliament approved the Watson report, with a series of measures which were essential to dealing with the issue of terrorism.
As has been mentioned here, a common definition of terrorism for all Member States, a European arrest warrant - which has been called for for some time - and the elimination of extradition seemed to us to be essential issues when Parliament asked for them on the 5th.
But in that same report Parliament also sent more than one political message to the other Community institutions: it asked for consideration of the fact that certain acts - and I quote - 'are orchestrated and carried out by groups organised at international level' and indicated that there were States behind these actions and that this must be confronted.
On 5 September, Mr President, this Parliament took the lead in asking the other institutions to adopt a firm attitude towards these issues.
We already had the commitment that Commissioner Vitorino would react positively.
On the 11th, Mr President, very soon afterwards, we realised that we had arrived late, dramatically late, and that the problem had exploded, not in the European Union, but in the United States, in an even more spectacular way - not dramatic, since it is always dramatic - than we have experienced here.
Mr Watson modestly tells us that what he asked for in his report is useful only within the European Union.
I do not agree.
I believe that, if we take this series of initiatives, we can make progress on an internal action which, as Mr Poettering said, would be a demonstration of our solidarity with the United States. If we, given the haste which is now required - and haste was already required - make more rapid progress in offering this example of how there can be an operational reaction on a supranational level in the fight against terrorism.
We will be sending the best indication of solidarity with the United States. We will be offering the best image, the best option for work in this supranational field against organised crime, as the United Nations recently requested in Palermo.
I hope that in the case of other measures, such as combating money laundering and so many others which are on the table in the Council, we will not wait until we have to act in haste, until there are other dramatic events, in order to implement them.
I believe that they are all essential to defending the world and, above all, freedom.
Mr President, when we visited Washington last week with this Parliament' s delegation, and stayed a few days longer than originally planned, not only myself but also our American colleagues became increasingly aware of a common interest.
I witnessed among the Americans, and certainly in their administration, more restraint than we generally give them credit for over here, or than we can infer from the sometimes unfortunately chosen words of the President.
Some of our American colleagues quite clearly said that the time for fine words is over.
I believe that they are right.
This is not only true of the relationship we have with them, but also of the action this Parliament intends to take.
If we want to talk about punishing terrorists, then we have, in fact, already missed the boat.
I hope that we can also talk about deterrence from time to time.
This would involve cooperation among police forces, examining magistrates and intelligence services.
Commissioner, I hope that your proposals will be dealt with as soon as possible, as I am sure they will be.
Then it will become clear who in this House is for or against cooperation, who truly wants to make headway and who does not.
President-in-Office of the Council, I hope that at your meetings behind closed doors, it will also be clear to us who is for and against, who wants to carry on and who does not, so that we can draw our own conclusions and make our own judgments. We are still in shock at the moment and are still sharing in the grief of our American friends, but who will recall this debate in one or two years' time?
I hope that we will still be very much alert and that we will be able to remember what was said here today.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, solidarity with the victims of the atrocious attacks is the first emotion we expressed - and rightly so.
But I welcome the fact that the Council and the Commission set to work at full tilt to formulate proposals.
We now have globalisation of terrorism.
Everyone is vulnerable.
But we can also turn our vulnerable world into a safer world.
That is the challenge.
However, it requires multilateral cooperation in a global fight against terrorism.
This is the positive element that I am trying to glean from the fact that Article 5 of the NATO Treaty has been invoked: that it is seen as a sign of solidarity.
I am not in favour of a blank cheque for any old military action which would claim more innocent victims and would create resentment and frustrations. I would rather see an invitation to enter into consultation and dialogue across the oceans, even though there is the risk of it not being seen in that light.
We should be aware that our people are anxious, that many people fear that we will simply be dragged along by a war machine.
We should realise that we must explain what our intentions are.
We must make this vulnerable world safer by providing political solutions to endless conflicts such as that in the Middle East.
We must bring hope to large parts of the world that have to live in despair.
Without a fair world order, stability and peace remain a distant dream, and there will always be a breeding ground for terrorism.
We are delighted with the unanimous will that has been expressed over the past couple of days and that has been echoed by the Council and the Commission on this platform.
We now look forward to action, rather than words, for as regards providing Europe with the resources to achieve these goals, some of our Member States have in the past persisted in throwing up barriers.
How long have we been waiting for the cooperation necessary to turn Europol into an effective instrument?
This was called for back at Amsterdam.
According to Mr Vitorino, the extradition of terrorists is the cornerstone of the fight against terrorism.
But it remains to be seen whether we can all agree.
The President-in-Office of the Council listed various instruments for the prevention of terrorism, but will we ever succeed in monitoring the flow of capital which feeds terrorism worldwide?
Will we ever want to, and be able to, exercise effective control over the arms trade?
Or will the economic arguments prevail tomorrow once more over the arguments for security and prevention of terrorism?
For terrorism exists, fanaticism exists, injustice exists.
There are many weapons which terrorists have not yet used but which are at their disposal thanks to our technological society.
Mr President, there is no cause, not even a just cause, which can justify the killing of innocent civilians.
Terror does not pave the way for justice: it is the shortest road to hell.
We condemn and deplore this appalling crime; we utterly condemn those who planned and perpetrated it.
Our empathy with the suffering victims, with the pain of their families and the pain of the entire American people at difficult times such as this is no less than the expression of our total commitment to preserving the unique nature of the human race.
These are not my words but some of the things Palestinian intellectuals, politicians and ministers such as Mr Yaser Abed Rabbo, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi and Mr Mahmoud Darwish have said.
They are powerful statements, and they give us hope for they come from people who live and suffer under the Israeli military occupation.
At times like these, we must all - people, States and institutions - act with the utmost responsibility and determination to remove terrorism from the face of the earth and put a stop to the globalisation of poverty, injustice and war for ever.
'Words must replace arms' as Mr Solana said.
Therefore, no words must be allowed to provoke hatred or promote the 'dead or alive' cowboy culture: as the women against war say, between killing and death there lies a third way, which is life.
No one must be exempt from training in love of peace and respect for the law, especially Heads of State.
Today, a glimmer of hope for the future has come from Palestine and Israel with the announcement of a truce. It is a faint chance, I know, but it is vital that we do not let it go.
The European Union has contributed to the possibility of dialogue being resumed.
The Union' s political role must grow and, if and as this role grows, the Union must uphold the law with increasing determination.
Just as we told Mr Arafat that he must be resolute in controlling terrorism, so we must make it quite clear to Mr Sharon that he cannot continue to get away with seizing Palestinian land, building settlements, killing and besieging Palestinians in villages or, as he did yesterday morning, destroying the Gaza port which is still under construction and funded by the countries of the European Union.
We must take tangible action, reassuring the Palestinians that they will have a safe State to live in and assuring Israel that nobody is questioning its existence, that it is its colonialist settlement policy, not its existence, which is in question.
Yesterday, in the Lebanon, I and an Italian delegation met President Lahoud.
He stated quite clearly that he rejected terrorism, but he stressed emphatically that resolution of the Palestinian issue and development of political and economic cooperation with Europe and the Arab world are essential.
We must believe in our own ability to bring peace and respect for the law.
Madam President, in the fight against terrorism, everyone has to understand that there have to be rules in a democracy and that those who violate laws and destroy freedom and security have to be punished.
In April, Commander Massoud came to the European Parliament seeking support for his opposition to the fundamentalist Taliban regime.
We welcomed him as a friend, just as we empathised with the victims of the fundamentalist regime in Algeria and the other countries where citizens, politicians and journalists have been massacred, even including Spain.
Now, Commander Massoud is dead, killed by a suicide terrorist attack just a few hours before other terrorists caused the absurd, appalling, atrocious carnage in the United States.
Clearly, terrorists and fundamentalists had planned a precise sequence of events, the first step being the elimination of the most powerful opponent to the Taliban regime.
If we genuinely want to combat and eradicate terrorism and its bases, its economic power and its message of hatred of democracy and freedom, we must give our full support to the Northern Alliance now: what we denied Commander Massoud when he was alive we owe to him now he is dead. We owe it to the men and women who are fighting for freedom.
We owe it to all those who are combating terrorism and fundamentalism in the world.
We also call upon the European Union to think again about whether it needs to establish effective border controls, even suspending Schengen temporarily, and, in any case, as President Pasqua has already said, to stop giving aid to those countries which harbour, fund and protect terrorist and criminal organisations. We call for regulation of the use of the Internet, for rules to be established at last, for, as we know, the lack of rules governing the use of the Internet make it easy for terrorism to gain support and operate at international level.
We call for the headquarters of those organisations which claim to be fighting religious wars, advocate violence and tolerate their members perpetrating terrorism to be closed.
Lastly, Mr President, we call upon the European Union to have the courage to hold a Euro-Mediterranean Conference to discuss our commitment to peace, where we can work together and defeat those continuing to sow hatred and violence.
Mr President, I too feel that our response to large-scale attacks must not take the form of a crusade against Islam, but certain things need to be said.
I would point out, in any case, that one of the organisations with which Osama bin Laden is linked is called the 'International Front for Fighting Jews and Crusades' .
I would also point out that part of the influx of billions of dollars of funding dispensed every year to Muslim charities and aid organisations is ultimately used to finance fundamentalist terrorism.
In addition to this, the profits from banks, Islamic businesses and financial institutions, located in tax havens, which are now, at last, regulated and identified on the international market as well, help to support the international Jihad terrorist force.
Here in Europe, there are Islamic centres and mosques which have been providing hospitality, screens and even false passports for fundamentalists connected to terrorist groups for years and continue to do so today. There is documented evidence of this.
Such complicity is a fact and I certainly do not think we can take a few general statements disassociating their authors from Osamar bin Laden as evidence of the conversion to peace and respect for human rights of these wings of the international Jihad force present in Europe.
I support Mrs Garaud' s call to realism this morning at the Conference of Presidents, when she called for a responsible international policy ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, according to a Chinese proverb, when a wise man points at the moon, the fool looks at his finger.
The European Union would be well advised to give some thought as to the meaning of this proverb because it is very difficult to actually see the relation between today' s debate and the unprecedented attacks on the United States, which took place on 11 September 2001.
Was the United States saved because of its police force or federal intelligence system?
It has one, of course.
The United States is the most powerful country in the world and this patently did not enable it to predict or prevent the events of Tuesday 11 September and we really cannot see what Europol can do in this matter, other than to strengthen the European Union, which once again is undoubtedly showing that its sole concern is its own power, that it has absolutely no interest whatsoever in the root causes of the problems and that it is only concerned by its return to a position of power.
If we - who claim to represent all the people of Europe - had to consider one subject, then it should be our failure to take responsibility and that we are responsible for leaving the United States alone to face the rest of the entire world, when our nations have over 1 000 years of diplomatic, historic and military experience...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, first of all I would like to emphasise the deep sympathy we feel for the victims of last week's attack.
Right now, before any military action takes place, we are already witnessing a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting many thousands of innocent people in Afghanistan.
The United States has announced that it will lift restrictions on intelligence agencies and give them a free hand to recruit criminals.
I quote Vice President Cheney: "To be able to penetrate these terrorist organisations, you need to have on the payroll some very unsavoury characters."
When President Bush declared war - and in fact this is a case of the rich versus the poor, which is the underlying struggle here - he said the war must be won with the tools of action.
The tools used should be the tools of justice, that is, not by suspending the rule of law or suppressing liberties, but on the contrary, by maintaining them.
Mr President, Madam Minister, Commissioner Vitorino, honourable Members of this House, if we fight the wrong war, we will lose.
Mr President, we will never forget the attacks against the United States, which we utterly condemn.
We share the grief of the civilian victims and their families and we share the values of our great ally - democracy and individual freedom.
Terrorism creates a state of mind.
It provokes outrage and reaction, so we must be united, we must be determined and we must be vigilant.
However, in addition to our united political reaction, we must adjust the European Union's diplomatic standpoint.
In the context of the current budget process, we must reassess the EU's vast aid programme, in particular, if states were involved in that terrorism in any way.
The EU is perceived as pro-Arab.
I regret this.
We should be pro-democracy.
War has been declared and we should unequivocally stand by our American allies.
My party and group are committed to giving our full support, in particular to the British Government, its partners in the European Union and to our NATO allies.
The scale and nature of the outrage we witnessed in the United States last week gives us a warning of what else the new millennium might bring, so we must look pragmatically at what we need to do together.
We should learn from each other as much as possible about how to deal with the security of our people and how best to reduce the tensions which lead to political violence and terrorism.
As far as possible, our electors should be allowed to get on with their lives, but we as politicians cannot rest while terrorism lives.
Mr President, I was in Washington last week leading the European Parliament delegation responsible for our relations with the United States Congress and we started our pre-Commission briefing at 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday, 11 September 2001, just after the first plane had hit one of the towers and just before the second.
Needless to say, our briefing did not go on for very long and we, like so many in the United States, were soon sitting in front of television sets, shocked and silent.
That was the mood in America in Tuesday.
By Wednesday, people were angry and frightened, understandably, and so were we.
Later there was much more thoughtfulness and a more considered response.
The many messages from the European Union, and indeed from the European Parliament, plus the many personal messages of support and solidarity, were very much appreciated.
We were able to fulfil part of our delegation duties, we met members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the Congress and had some very useful, although very sad discussions with them.
The question they put to us was: How will Europe help us?
Will Europe support us?
That was really most difficult.
It would have been premature and inappropriate for a partial delegation to respond.
Of course, we did not know how we should respond.
I made a statement to Congress on behalf of the delegation which was lodged in the Congressional Records and I hope with your permission it can be lodged in our own Parliament records as well.
This statement stressed, apart, of course, from the natural sympathy that we wanted to express, that this had to be tackled by the United States of America and the European Union and many other countries in partnership.
It is becoming ever clearer that the response must be measured and proportionate, and the consequences for all must be anticipated and planned.
There is a clear need for major diplomatic and political initiatives to maintain cooperation with those countries nearest to any possible targets or military action and those at most risk from the consequences.
We may be facing terrible times ahead but it is essential that we have the courage as well as the compassion to consider carefully the alternatives.
I would like to express my thanks to the many here, including the President, who expressed their concerns for our safety and well-being and particularly to my fellow MEPs, including Mr Belder, Mrs Peijs, my two vice-chairman, the other MEPs, the Parliament staff, Council and Commission staff interpreters and particularly the Commission staff in Washington.
They were endlessly kind in what was a most difficult week.

Mr President, the attacks in America remind me most of the attack on the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo in June 1914, when a terrorist, who appeared from nowhere, struck at the heart of the Habsburg Empire, a superpower deemed invincible.
That fatal incident elicited an overreaction, which led to the First World War.
It is of the utmost importance to combat international terrorism.
It is equally important for this to be done collectively, forcefully and - I emphasise - with well-considered restraint.
The European Union itself must also set to work.
Commissioner, thank you, you are not the problem, neither is this Parliament.
I would address my former colleague, the Minister of the Belgian Presidency.
Tampere was two years ago.
I would urge the Belgian Presidency to abolish the right of veto in the Third Pillar. If not, we will remain bogged down and unable to tackle terrorism effectively.
Mr President, I was part of the delegation which visited Washington last week.
I saw the dismay, horror and despair caused by the attack, and I shared and felt this sorrow and despair.
I still feel strongly for the families of those still missing.

After listening to the debate here, I have put away the script for the speech I had prepared. Instead, I would like to talk about something which has come to me while I have been listening to this discussion.
I am deeply concerned both about what has happened and about the reaction caused by the events in the US and in Europe.
I am convinced that, at the same time as we ourselves feel the horror of this event, there are millions upon millions of people out there in the world who have actually rejoiced in this act of terrorism. I believe that many poor people in Asia, Africa and other parts of the world have rejoiced.
We have read about young people in Palestine celebrating this act of violence. I do not believe they were alone in this, but that there are millions and millions of people out there in the world who have reacted in this way.
This fills me with incredible horror and fear, as it means that we are facing a world in which there are millions of potential terrorists and perpetrators of similar outrages.
We must begin to ask ourselves whether we are now witnessing a sort of social warfare.
Does this bear any relation to colonial uprisings?
From my childhood, I remember the Mau Mau uprising, which was described as a terrorist insurrection.
We all remember the Vietnam War, for example.
Is it a social war which, in one way or another, lies behind recent events or which is being declared through them?
In that case, ideas about mass bombings in the Middle East or about preposterous police checks on a huge scale are meaningless.
Our only chance, in that case, is a huge policy of transformation and redistribution, a policy which removes the desperation and despair in the world which feed and create terrorism.
Otherwise, we shall never be safe, despite carpet-bombing and despite all the security services in the world.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the United States of America and the free world have been taken by surprise by the absolutely barbaric wave of attacks that has destroyed the lives of thousands of men, women and children from more than 60 countries, murdered in appalling circumstances of horror and brutality.
Once again, therefore, our first words must be, like those of so many other speakers, words of solidarity and condolence, and we must turn our thoughts to all these lives cut short and to the suffering of their families.
Such attacks completely exceed all the bounds of the imaginable and confirm the fears that the fanaticism of terrorist groups will neither give way nor weaken in the face of any considerations of compassion, which makes us fear for the worst for the future if not enough is done to combat or eradicate such fanaticism.
The last thing we want to see is a new rift between East and West.
We can quite easily distinguish those who freely and peacefully practice the Islamic faith from those who, quite intolerably, take a medieval concept of holy war as the inspiration for attacking citizens, communities and states across the world who simply wish to live in peace.
We must, therefore, respond vigorously to those who are responsible for these appalling acts, which are genuine acts of war against the free world; not only to those who were directly involved in carrying out the acts but also to those who have given shelter to, protected, funded or encouraged these people.
In this context, the European Union has enormous responsibilities as a community that acts as a trustee of the universal values of life, freedom, peace and security.
Apart from stimulating relationships of trust, cooperation and cultural dialogue with all Islamic communities and citizens that share these universal values, in an attempt to involve them in an active commitment against terrorism and the threat that this represents, the European Union and its Member States must establish, between themselves and internationally, new and more effective forms of cooperation in the field of gathering and processing information by police forces, in harmonising judicial and legal systems and finally, in the field of common security and defence, which will help to guard against and allow the harsh punishment of anyone who encourages this new form of world threat or their agents.
We wish to express our expectation and, I would say, our hope, that today' s debate and the conclusions of next Friday' s European Council will be a decisive step forwards in the long and difficult fight against international terrorism. This is a fight that we must see, now and for as long as the threat lasts, as our utmost priority for European, Atlantic and world-wide security.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to a great many sound proposals and seen that there is some convergence too.
However, I have to say that, as long as the European banks accept terrorists' deposits and increase their capital, we are not combating terrorism; as long as arms are sold to different countries (according to geopolitical interests) which accept the role of the askaris of one or other power in turn, we are not combating terrorism.
Madam President, I believe that, for as long as we talk about 'war' on a daily basis, peace will not be possible.
The whole world is afraid because of the vehement statements - and I understand the emotions and the political situation - of the American President, whose reasons of State we acknowledge and for whom we express all our support and sympathy.
However, we hope that the word 'war' will be targeted against very specific fringe members of the Arab world, for the Arab world as a whole does not deserve to be treated as criminal because of the criminal actions of a tiny, criminal minority of delinquents who are stateless because of their own intentional, senseless, barbaric lunacy.
Mr President, on behalf of my party, may I offer my deepest condolences to the people of the United States.
With our very special relationship and with hundreds of British still missing, we too share their desperate feeling of loss.
My first observation must be to my own Prime Minister, who of course was instrumental in the release of over 400 convicted terrorists.
We must fight terrorism in all its forms and we must say 'No' to any more appeasement.
I would also like to urge the Council and Commission not to use this opportunity to further the project of European integration.
The peoples of Europe will not forgive politicians putting their self-interest above the security of the people.
However dark and uncertain the future may be, we must stand firm behind the USA as that noble country did for us in our darkest hour.
Our commitment to the defeat of terrorism must be no less than theirs.
Mr President, this terrorist attack in the USA affects us all, unfortunately, and not only because there are probably hundreds of Europeans among its victims.
Thirty Austrians alone are missing to date.
Europeans should be seen unreservedly offering solidarity and cooperation in response to this terrorist attack, and the European partners should refrain from imposing conditions.
The EU Member States, Spain and France, have, without doubt, set a standard here, both sending politicians to the USA at a very early stage.
I wish to appeal to the Austrian political parties to lay their so-called neutrality completely aside, as there can be no neutrality between terrorists and innocent victims.
Just as important, in this international joint endeavour, as the working relationship of the democratic countries with each other will be their cooperation with moderate Arab States and with those with Moslem majority populations.
The most important foundation for a successful counterstrike this time will be effective international solidarity.
And as for those who offer us their pacifist fantasies and words of wisdom about military restraint, I should like to invite them to New York, so they can visit the school my children go to and talk to the children who have lost their fathers or mothers or, indeed, both parents in this attack.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, solidarity in speech must now give way to solidarity in action.
In Germany, the Christian Democratic parties - the CDU and CSU - feel, in any case, that we have obligations towards the Americans in our joint resistance to terrorism, too.
American action was decisive in the reconstruction of our country and the recovery of our unity.
So we must share with them the burden of combating terrorism.
Mr Vitorino's proposals are a first step on this road, and the right one.
They are not, however, short-term measures.
They will become effective in 2002 at the earliest.
Right and proper as they are, we can and must do more.
We can, for example, make Europol better equipped than it is at present.
Europol urgently needs an agreement with the USA, within the framework of laws currently in force, on the exchange of data in the fight against terrorism.
Such arrangements have previously foundered on our making our data protection provisions into the measure of all things.
Our protection of data has therefore been of more use to the terrorists than it has to their victims.
We must make it possible for Europol to become immediately operational.
We must at once put in place whatever joint action teams are available.
Wherever terrorists are being investigated, Europol must be on the spot and promoting the immediate exchange of data between the investigators and those working in Europol headquarters.
These opportunities already exist, and we must seize them.
It can be done within the framework of the laws in force and does not require us to wait for the incorporation of directives into national law.
Mr President, Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no excuse for any terrorist act.
Terrorism is, above all, contempt for life, contempt for the life of innocent citizens, sometimes even contempt for one' s own life.
If all citizens have a duty to stand in the way of terrorism, it is not sufficient merely to arrest and pass judgment on the perpetrators and organisers of terrorist acts.
More than anything, we need to improve the conditions which give rise to terrorism: poverty, underdevelopment and ignorance are fertile ground for all kinds of fundamentalism.
It is a paradox that any unforeseeable event can easily be explained after it has happened, but it is not sufficient just to explain the world, we have to change it.
The world economy is in bad shape.
After the attack on the United States, it risks getting even worse, particularly if there is prolonged military action.
Europe, in order to be able to help others, should tackle its own economic problems.
We should welcome the cut in interest rates, and it is also true that the ECB could have better prepared the markets.
These measures would have prevented many stock market crashes.
If there is no balanced growth in the long term, no stabilisation of public deficit, such a shock from the exterior that is unforeseen and unforeseeable should lead Europe to bring automatic stabilisers into play for all EU countries.
This is not economic laxity but good economic sense.
This good economic sense is demonstrated to us by our American friends.
They have just decided on a substantial aid package for their civil aviation.
Does this mean that Europe will now complain to the WTO about this distortion of competition?
Or will she also establish a policy to support those economic sectors weakened by this terrible shock?
Luckily, we have the euro.
Without the common currency there would have been turmoil on international money markets, pushing certain currencies such as the Deutschmark to the top and others seen as weaker to the bottom, with the breakdown of the internal market into the bargain.
There is not only Europe, however.
There are poor countries that have a greater risk of suffering from any economic turnaround in a recession that is still a possibility.
Our main priority should be to aim for the true integration of all countries into world trade.
Globalisation, often discredited, only in fact affects a severely limited number of countries.
Four fifths of world trade takes place between thirty or so countries.
There will be no development without trade.
Any economy, in order to be able to export, should create endogenous growth, itself creating greater equity within a country.
In order to permit this endogenous development in poor countries, the problem of third world debt needs to be resolved as soon as possible.
It is only by eradicating poverty and ignorance that we will definitively defeat terrorism.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, international terrorism is threatening to multiply its actions and the brutality of the techniques it employs too - the atrocities in the United States were evidence of this, I am sad to say - while other serious threats such as chemical or nuclear weapons are still present.
Coherent, common European reactions of defence and response are vital, and the Council and Commission statements have set us off in the right direction.
However, there is still a complex issue to be resolved in international legal systems or, if you prefer, international law: the attitude to be taken by institutions such as the European Union or even the United Nations to States which tolerate and collaborate with terrorist groups.
There can be no allowances or half-measures such as have hitherto been conceded in these matters.
In any case, nothing will ever be the same and Friday' s extraordinary Summit will certainly be able to address this issue.
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe and the European Parliament are standing shoulder to shoulder with the United States at this dark time in human history, which is certainly the darkest moment since the end of the Second World War.
We are standing by the United States not least because the victims of the various attacks include a large number of Europeans, many of them Italians.
It was not just the symbols of the economic and collective freedom of the West that were the targets on 11 September: we have all been affected.
Europe must take the lead in the new political phase which has opened after the recent tragic events.
Starting with Parliament, our institutions must play a prominent role in the coming weeks and months.
Together with all the countries of the world, the Union will be summoned to the front line, and the decisions we are called upon to make will have to focus on certain major questions including, most importantly, identifying those responsible.
This is vital if the United States and the allies who decide to support it are to be able to react against terrorism in the way that they must, but the aim of the action taken must be to strike those responsible for the atrocities in New York and Washington.
If we are to win this war against terrorism, Commissioner, we need a thorough reinvigoration of the secret services sector.
In order to do this, in addition to enhancing Europol, which we advocate, it appears increasingly necessary to create a sort of supranational intelligence service.
This was discussed at the Summit between the Italian and British prime ministers, a project seeking to create an organisation which can expose and help combat terrorism in all its tentacular ramifications.
The strategy and international action taken must, of necessity, include all the Arab countries.
It must be clear that the battle currently being played out is not between the West and Islam: it is between the whole world and the lunacy of terrorism.
That is why we attach great importance to Russia and China' s declarations and see the positions of Yasser Arafat and the Israeli government in taking certain decisions which facilitate encouraging steps towards peace in the Middle East as positive.
A military and intelligence response must, in any case, be accompanied by an incisive Union policy in the areas where there is worst crisis: an action intended to extinguish the flames of desperation and intolerance.
The possibility of financial speculation initiated by terrorists on stock markets throughout the world and the crisis experienced by many airlines which will lead to thousands of job cuts demand a raft of measures from the international community to protect the economy as well.
Mr President, Europe and all its institutions are called to undergo a great test.
However, we are all convinced that people will decide en masse for what is right and the values of freedom, democracy and tolerance which we all now uphold will ultimately prevail; we are sure that the European Parliament, the institution which represents the people of Europe, will, from Friday onwards, certainly do its part.
Mr President, there is no doubt that the whole of the European Union stands together with the people of the United States in utterly and totally condemning those who carried out those terrible atrocities in the United States and in expressing our deepest sympathy to the families who lost their loved ones in these terrible atrocities.
The European Union and all democratic societies in the world should join together with the United States in seeking to bring to justice those guilty of those atrocities and in doing so, ensure that they target the actual terrorist organisations and their members, not the communities in which they live with the danger of innocent people suffering.
Generally, terrorism is found in areas of conflict resolution where unfortunately many of those involved believe in what they are doing.
The European Union can play a major role in solving conflict resolution in the different parts of the world by sending to those areas of conflict not an army but a philosophy of peace based on firm principles.
It is often forgotten, that the European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution.
Who could have forecast 60 years ago where we all are now?
Who would have forecast all this in 1941, with the second world war raging and millions being slaughtered.
If our parents and grandparents had said "Don't worry, your grandchildren will be sitting together in a parliament of a United Europe", nobody would have believed them.
But it has happened, and how and why it happened is crucial.
For that reason the European Union, rather than having an army, should set up a Commission department of peace and reconciliation with a Commissioner of peace and reconciliation to spread this philosophy.
Firstly, in all areas of conflict you have divided peoples.
Violence has no role to play in healing the divisions.
Dialogue is the first step.
Secondly there is the principle of respect for difference because all conflict is about difference, whether of religion, nationality or race.
Thirdly, you need to create institutions which respect those differences, and the fourth element is working together in the common interest.
Those are the principles at the heart of the European Union that solved the worst conflicts in the history of the world and are the principles that should be at the heart of conflict resolution in any area of conflict.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has up to this moment been more vulnerable in every respect than the USA, and will remain so for as long as cooperation between Member States in both the legal and operational aspects of counter-terrorism is not optimised.
Admittedly, we have Europol as an institution whose remit covers terrorism among other things, but Europol is powerless if not all Member States comply with the Convention, supply in due time comprehensive information for the analyses required and subsequently make aid available to their fellow Member States.
Europol is toothless if it has insufficient personnel at its disposal, and at present a mere 12 Europol staff are pursuing inquiries into terrorism in Europe.
Europol is also toothless if the technology it needs is not made available to it.
A package of measures is therefore urgently required, and quickly.
I therefore want the Member States to be exhorted to adhere strictly to the Europol Convention, in particular Article 4, and a mechanism to be introduced to compel the Member States to supply this information.
Secondly, we must provide a budget sufficient to equip a centre of operations with an appropriate number of analysts to engage in investigations into terrorism.
Counter-terrorism demands, thirdly, that we set up joint investigatory teams within the framework of collaboration between Europol analysts and representatives of the Member States.
We welcome the accelerated initiative of Mr Vitorino's two framework decisions as a new and urgently needed legal basis with which to effectively combat terrorism.
Europe, above all others, has demands made of it.
Europe is called, now, to be more than decisive in taking a stand in the face of terrorism and taking action to counter it.
Such is the demand of the moment.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the attack of 11 September on the WTC and the Pentagon strikes at the very heart of our democracy.
The key aim of the new terrorism is to instil fear into us, to throw our world off balance and at the same time to exploit the helplessness of others in simple black-and-white terms.
In a nutshell, this is an attack on our world, the whole world, and on our international rule of law, and this is precisely what I should like to uphold.
Terrorism has become global and also employs, therefore, global, modern technology and international, criminal structures.
That is why it requires a worldwide response.
For example, a higher level of cooperation among our secret services and the infiltration of terrorist networks spring to mind.
We can no longer afford to work at cross purposes as separate states.
Instead, we must take joint action and in this new coalition of action, we must go beyond usual concepts.
International financial consortia and multinational businesses too must cooperate.
The production of drugs and oil in regions of conflict and the trade in 'blood diamonds' facilitate the financing of illegal activities, of conflict and of war, and are in turn closely linked with the terrorist networks.
We must discontinue the funding of, or cooperation in, the trade in raw materials, where this feeds conflicts and where it provides a breeding ground for terrorism.
In this way, we can immobilise the funding of terrorist networks extremely effectively.
This new war also requires a continued effort in the exchange of economic and criminal intelligence, even if this means that for reasons of security, some public services become more expensive or slow down.
Our desire to live in an open democracy that is accessible to everyone makes us vulnerable.
But our strength lies in cooperation.
This applies overall, irrespective of race, religion or nationality.
We can see through every terrorist attempt to divide the world into their world and ours, to antagonise groups or religions.
Terrorists are not nourished by religion or ideology.
Their hunger is called power.
Their weapons are fear and destruction.
They do not want peace in the Basque Country, Liberia or the Middle East. They simply want civilian victims.
That is why we are on the side of America and of every peace-loving individual who wishes to support this international order.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we can see that the response to this terrorist act is being prepared, and I believe it is being done with great care.
The United States is dealing with this business calmly and attempting to solve the problem in a multilateral context, including cooperation with NATO.
This indicates that all is being done with calm deliberation.
I believe that, for this reason, we must also make it clear that there is no reason for us to evade our responsibilities and obligations, not simply because of our gratitude and not only in order to guarantee the future of transatlantic relations, but because it is in our most fundamental best interests.
Terrorism is taking on the dimensions of a war and resulting in destruction the like of which we knew only in wartime; it is this terrorism that is in a position to strike in the same way at Brussels today, London tomorrow and Madrid the day after tomorrow!
The combatants are already in our midst, and so nobody can steal away.
Nobody, I believe, should look for an alibi, a reason not to join in when the action really does start; and, when it does, it will involve the taking of steps which we must develop on the basis of a new definition of security policy: military action involving the application of all foreign policy instruments, for example the prevention of alliances in favour of the other side, and in conjunction with internal security, about which Mr Vitorino and many in this House have already spoken.
On this last point, it must be clear that cross-border measures can be put in place against cross-border terrorism and that the best national legislation and the best national police can do nothing without cooperation in this sphere.
Let me finally say just one thing: nothing justifies terrorism, but we must still make it our concern to remove the root causes of support for it.
We must, therefore, play our part in removing the breeding-grounds for terrorism in the Middle East and in many other regions
Mr President, the terrorist attacks of 11 September have meant that our debate on the need for Community action to combat terrorism is now extremely topical.
We are still overwhelmed by the horrendous pictures, the horrendous truth and their grave consequences now and, we imagine and fear, for the future.
Quite apart from the effect on the economy or on world political relations, however, thousands of people have died, thousands have lost their parents, children, spouses, friends and loved ones.
I would like to dedicate my first words to those people who are suffering, to the victims: they, the victims, must be present in our future deliberations and decisions.
Because we owe a debt to all of them.
We will have to act so that justice is done and in order to prevent, through action or omission, more innocent victims.
We know that something has to be done, that there has to be a response, a just, democratic, proportionate response, but a response nevertheless, because terrorists cannot be allowed to have, or believe they have, impunity and because we are obliged to assure the citizens that, living under the rule of law, we have the necessary instruments to defend their life, freedom and security.
I cannot and will not ignore the fact that I am Basque.
I would rather have not had this experience in this field, I would do anything not to have had it, but I have.
I know that international cooperation is the right approach, that the initiatives presented today by Commissioner Vitorino are the right approach: political cooperation, judicial cooperation, police cooperation.
Joint responsibility in dealing with terrorism is our main, most effective, political response.
Ladies and gentlemen, terrorism - as has already been said - has no borders, no homeland, no religion and no ideology.
It has a common objective and method.
They have never wanted peace.
They have always sought to destroy us, to destroy democracy.
I therefore say to them that what the Commission has decided today, what has been approved today, is historic.
Allow me to describe it as such.
The necessary step has been taken to move on from solidarity, which is necessary but insufficient, to common action by all.
Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino, and thank you to all of you for this decision.
Mr President, immensely rich élites, members and accomplices of which have enjoyed university training, are attacking our financial, economic and security institutions.
This horrific tragedy requires a response.
The citizen asks the government to take action.
In terms of external policy, the European Union is able to do this because we increasingly speak with one voice.
The value of our input in the eradication of breeding grounds for terror has increased by leaps and bounds, as will be seen, I hope, in the near future.
As regards internal policy, we still cannot manage to speak with one voice.
Basically, the 'every man for himself' mentality still prevails.
Fortunately, the Commission has realised that this is not acceptable.
Mr Vitorino, I would like to commend you on the fact that you, and the Commission, have realised that speaking with one voice on behalf of the European Union is absolutely necessary.
Within the space of one week, you produced a detailed plan with proposals which are both practical and also truly necessary.
This will be rewarded in the form of the citizen' s trust.
I hope that none of the Member States will dare to distance themselves from this critical plan, inviting the outrage of its own citizens in doing so.
Needless to say, justice is important in this context, for we are dealing with a crime here, with whatever fine motives it is presented.
This is also evident in Northern Ireland where agreements contain terms which are used incorrectly and which are an insult to anyone who takes their religion seriously.
We have reason to be pleased with the Watson report which provides an initial impulse to the Parliament' s endeavours and may be supplemented with propositions concerning the preparation of crimes which are committed elsewhere, that is, outside the European Union.
We trust that the Commissioner will not accept draft framework decisions which contain weak formulae such as we now see from time to time and which have absolutely no meaning whatsoever.
The real added value must lie in the fact that it becomes clear to the citizens that the European Union, as such, takes charge where guaranteeing internal security is concerned.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we must also draw conclusions as regards civil aviation.
We need to take steps to prevent similar terrorist attacks again taking place in or from the air.
In the immediate future we need increased security for air travellers, preferably at international level.
Let us each, though, start with our airports at home.
We need stricter checks on luggage and hand luggage.
We need tighter checks on airport workers.
Above all, it will not be enough for controls at airports to be more stringent today and tomorrow if, in six months' time, they have been relaxed again in certain parts of Europe.
No, we need strict controls on a permanent basis.
Looking at specific cases, there is probably a need for armed flight attendants on certain routes, and we must consider the need to secure the cockpit against terrorist attacks, for we must prevent aircraft becoming the biggest weapons in the world.
Although the safety of passengers is our primary concern, our secondary concern is that, at present, the number of passengers carried by airlines is showing a massive decrease.
We must keep an eye on this situation.
Is the number of passengers falling as a consequence of the terrorist attacks, or because of market conditions or structural factors?
As we read in today's newspapers, certain governments are demanding subsidies and yet more subsidies, but these cannot be the solution.
My group rejects subsidies for airlines.
We must give thought to how we can help them.
We can do this by coming to an agreement on code sharing and by permitting the restructuring of the companies, along with mergers and acquisitions.
This would be a more elegant solution, keeping them competitive, but we must not pay out subsidies indiscriminately
The situation can, of course, change.
If the USA supports its airlines to the tune of massive amounts, then we will have to see what effect that has on the transatlantic market.
Under such circumstances, we will not be able simply to leave our airlines on the outside looking in, but let us be clear-sighted about this. First of all, however, we need increased security for passengers.
Mr President, on Tuesday we awoke in astonishment to a manifestation of a new form of totalitarianism.
The Nazism of the past, the Stalinism of yesterday and the Islamic fundamentalism of today all had and have in common a most profound contempt for human beings, who they intend to subject to their plans for world domination.
On 11 September, it was not only the freedom but also the dignity of the human being that was attacked in New York and Washington.
Those who financed this monstrous attack deliberately sacrificed the lives of their own people with the sole objective of killing the largest number of innocent victims possible, in order to put terror firmly into their opponents' minds and to rekindle the flame of their supporters' fanaticism.
The resolve shown throughout the world proves that they did not succeed in their main objective, but the subsequent celebrations that took place in various locations show that the second objective could well have been achieved.
Faced with this menace, we will naturally be obliged to review our common defence policy, but we should also be working toward the implementation of a new world order that allows Europe, in particular, to be increasingly engaged in the resolution of regional conflicts which, in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, and in Africa, do nothing to stem the flow of blood around the world.
In order to combat fundamentalist terrorism, we should mainly focus our efforts on increased assistance to all supporters of moderate and tolerant Islam, whether they be in power or in opposition.
In Afghanistan, for example, we had no idea of how to respond to the urgent request from Commander Massoud to destroy the hornets' nest that had developed in his country.
We should support his partisans in the Northern Alliance, the sole representatives of the recognised government in Afghanistan, and help them in any way we can to overthrow the barbarous Taliban regime.
To combat fundamentalist terrorism we need to completely restructure our own defence mechanisms.
Europe does not have the means.
The American Congress and Senate have just allocated USD 40 billion to the President of the United States.
What amount of money, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, do you have today to demonstrate, other than through fine words, our desire to stand shoulder to shoulder with the American people in this fight that has been forced upon us?
Ladies and gentlemen, today everything has changed.
I hope that in the adoption of our 2002 draft budget at second reading we will know how to draw the right conclusions.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, I represent a country which has a unique and close historical relationship with the United States.
We very much appreciated the support we received from that country in eliminating violence on our own island.
What happened in New York and Washington is not new.
Attacks on economic, political and security targets resulting in major civilian casualties have been the hallmark of international terrorism.
They have been experienced in Ireland, Britain, Spain and other European countries: that is why we share and understand the pain of those who have suffered.
We in Ireland hope that this atrocity will precipitate a change in the way representatives of organisations responsible for similar atrocities in Ireland are treated as celebrities in parts of the United States.
Hopefully, it will also undermine their fund-raising capabilities, particularly when their paramilitary wing still retains the weapons of terrorism and mass destruction and fraternises with other terrorist leaders.
The major issue facing democratic leaders is how to respond to this latest atrocity.
When I listen to the language currently being used by President George W. Bush, I must say I am somewhat apprehensive.
To talk about catching 'dead or alive' may well be the language of cowboy movies, but it is not the language that should be used by a world leader at any time, and certainly not during times of crises.
The revulsion that followed last week's events, provides the impetus to unite everyone in support of democratic ideals in the fight against international terrorism.
Handled wrongly however, it could plunge the western world into a conflict with the Islamic world with catastrophic consequences for everyone.
Therefore the response must be well thought out and proportionate.
It must not result in unnecessary civilian casualties creating another generation of terrorists.
We have a unique opportunity to rid the world of the evil of terrorism and underpin democracy.
Future generations will not forgive us if we squander that opportunity.
Mr President, in the United Kingdom we have unity of purpose at this tragic time.
We are reassured by the solidarity with the United States expressed by political leaders right across Europe. Previously, the enthusiasm of so many European politicians for European integration has been fuelled by anti-Americanism.
There must be no more of this.
Seldom has the need for Euro/Atlantic unity been more vital.
I trust that European Union leaders will make sure that there is no backsliding by any European governments when the going starts to get rough.
In previous crises, the resolve of some has quickly crumbled.
It would be singularly inappropriate to use this crisis to promote and accelerate the integrationist agenda of the Union, in particular the essentially separatist elements of European defence policy.
Our motive must be serious action against terrorism, not just seizing an opportunity to extend EU competencies.
On the internal front, I hope that the proposed European Union common definition of terrorist crime and associated legislation will be sufficiently robust to allow effective action at last to be taken against large numbers of terrorist front organisations throughout Europe.
I have to say, I doubt it.
The problem is that too many terrorists have their apologists and masquerade in other guises.
Ways need to be found to prevent terrorist support groups from carrying out what are still regarded as legal acts in our countries, such as recruiting, indoctrinating, broadcasting and fund-raising in order to sustain illegal acts elsewhere.
Specifically, it is time for the seven European Union countries which have not yet done so, including the Belgian Presidency, to ratify and implement the UN Convention for the suppression of terrorist financing, so that the black money networks which sustain terrorist organisations can be closed down.
Democratic society needs to protect itself and be able to deal with real dangers.
In recent years, it has been progressively disarmed.
Mr President, I firmly condemn terrorist acts.
Terrorism is abhorrent, whatever adjectives you use to describe it and whatever ideological label you attach to it.
I too feel that we must establish very close cooperation with the United States and form an extensive world-wide alliance of all the countries that wish to be part of it to combat terrorism.
The world-wide anti-terrorism alliance must certainly address military issues to ensure safety, but it must also address all the possible forms of terrorism which exist, which range from financial to banking terrorism, and from economic, food contamination and environmental terrorism to electronic terrorism and terrorism in the form of computer hacking.
The debate between the European Parliament, the OSCE and the WEU, which met at the assembly of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, focused largely, on the one hand, on the need to speed up the process of democratising those countries and, on the other, on the upholding of human rights. These are the two fundamental pillars for eradicating poverty and underdevelopment through the rational use of economic resources.
Henceforth, the European Union must stipulate the upholding of human rights and the implementation of democracy as firm conditions in all its external relations.
This stipulation is fixed and unconditional because it guarantees the protection of the dignity of every citizen in the world.
The European Union must encourage respect for every religious faith and, at the same time, it must require all faiths to condemn and abhor terrorist acts, to make a clear distinction between civil society, which is free to practise any religion, and terrorism, which cannot claim to have any religious justification.
I support the idea of convening a Mediterranean Forum condemning terrorism, supporting the Middle East Peace Process and reinvigorating the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.
Finally, Europol and Eurojust must, together, become effective European tools, concentrating on enhancing the European corpus juris and thereby creating a basic legal reference framework which will serve as the basis for European civil, penal and administrative law.
Mr President, I share and express my sympathy for the United States and for the other victims of this terrible incident.
As a former Northern Ireland minister, I have been a terrorist target and I have faced the TV cameras surrounded by the wreckage of a terrorist incident.
I know, therefore, how important it is to get both the response right and also to protect the general public as far as is possible in a democracy.
Like my colleague, Mr Jarzembowski, I am chiefly concerned about aviation and the mostly ordinary people who rely on it.
As a member of the Committee on Transport, I have written to the chairman of that committee asking for early consideration of the implications for this important industry.
First of all, security at airports and on aircraft; secondly, the control of congested airspace in view of the likely increase in military activity, the dangers of hostile incursion into European civil airspace and, of course, as he said, about the continued viability of European airlines.
It is vital that we are consistent in our approach to public safety and to the collective peace of mind throughout the Union.
We must not overreact, exacerbating the understandable fears of the traveller and threatening their civil liberties, but we must get it right and we must do so immediately.
We must act alongside our friends and allies within the United States of America and in international organisations such as the ICAO.
To get it right will require work and effort and a commitment: As Mr Van Orden said, we want to make certain that we are saying and doing the same things in six months' time as we profess to do now.
In conclusion, the message is quite simple: Terrorism must not be allowed to win.
Any attack upon civilians is abominable, and the sabre rattling we are hearing in Washington - the President uses expressions such as 'crusade' - is therefore also abominable.
It is monstrous because we know that a military intervention will, in any case, destroy civil society and create the best possible breeding ground for further terrorism.
Our most important task is to remind our allies in the United States of the need for caution and considered action, for terrorism is not to be combated through military action.
With regard to the proposals tabled by the Commission, I would just say that these do not contain what is necessary to prevent terrorism, whose roots go much deeper.
What is proposed is neither necessary nor adequate to stamp out terrorism and does not even begin to pinpoint the fundamental causes, which is what is important.
Let us steer clear of these military metaphors and this talk of battles, crusades and waging war.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened carefully to the many speeches in this debate and believe that a number of very valid points have been made.
Needless to say, the events of last Tuesday were a kind of wake-up call for Europe.
As many of you have already stated, it is true that we will need to take decisive action in future in order to remove the inconsistencies between the first, second and third pillars of integration, in other words the second and third pillars within the entire European construction.
Some may appreciate in these circumstances that a plea for this does not point to an institutional compulsion, but rather to a concern for the effectiveness of the Union' s actions.
In this connection, I have taken a careful note of the invitation which your Member and my friend, Mr Jan-Kees Wiebenga, addressed to me.
I would like to tell him to go ahead straight away with the good work by convincing his own political party and his own government to abolish any veto with regard to the Third Pillar.
That would be a huge step in the right direction.
As far as our cooperation with the United States is concerned, I have, on behalf of the Council, said that this must be stepped up and will need to go beyond the usual forms of cooperation.
Together with many of you, I hope that the American request for aid from Europe, as repeated by various Members here today, will remain just as clear in future and that provision will be made for a balanced cooperation, by means of which we, on an equal footing, inform, support and help each other as much as possible in all the actions which are necessary to combat international terrorism.
As some of you have already stated, I would, on behalf of the Council, like to underline that it would be a terrible mistake to view the events of the past week as a kind of conflict between two civilisations, or worse, a conflict between philosophical-religious world visions.
Radicalism is nobody' s monopoly, unfortunately, and neither is fanaticism.
What happened last week is so horrific on account of its sheer scale and the large number of victims involved.
Those images will be etched in our minds forever, but unfortunately, every day, we are once again faced with expressions of blind fanaticism, much closer to home, which cannot be ascribed - as happens - to certain world visions.
I would like to warn against this most emphatically.
We must not go in that direction and we must, on the contrary, ensure that all sources of conflict on our own continent, but also elsewhere, are brought within peace processes as soon as possible.
Like many of you, I have the Middle East in mind but not only the Middle East.
I am also thinking of the Balkans - yesterday, in Parliament, a conference was held on the Stability Pact relating to the Balkans - and Africa - I talked this afternoon abut the programme of our Presidency concerning Africa.
As I already stated in my first speech, the European Union is growing into a global power quicker than many had envisaged and slower than many would wish.
That brings with it additional weighty responsibilities.
I hope that in the next couple of weeks and months, we will prove worthy of those additional weighty responsibilities.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is grateful for your contributions to this debate.
I shall certainly convey to President Prodi and to my colleague Christopher Patten the questions for which they are directly responsible within the Commission.
For my part, I should simply like to emphasise three points. The first is to say that I fully share the idea that the strategy on terrorism should not be caught between the various pillars of the European Union.
There must be a global strategy that harnesses various instruments, such as conflict prevention policy, of course, the development of a political dialogue with the most problematic regions under the common foreign and security policy, of course, development aid policy, of course, but also, and let us be quite clear on this point, security policy and police and judicial cooperation policy.
We cannot ignore the deep-rooted causes of terrorism, but we cannot allow the slightest ambiguity to remain and we therefore state that no cause justifies the use of terrorism and violence that sacrifices innocent lives.
The best way of combating terrorism in the name of democratic values, therefore, consists of using the weapons of the law, cooperation between police forces and cooperation between the courts.
It is worth emphasising, however, that there are clearly some issues which we must look into, such as the funding of terrorism, the need to rigorously apply the United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, the need to adopt effective mechanisms to combat money laundering and the tax havens that provide financial support for terrorist groups and the United Nations Convention on arms trafficking. In other words, we need to implement the Palermo Convention on organised crime.
These are many ways of proving, within the framework of the United Nations, that the people who died on 11 September did not die in vain.
In other words, that States have learned the lesson and that they are willing to give incontrovertible proof that they are improving cooperation in the fight against terrorism.
The second issue that I wish to address concerns aviation safety. I am pleased to say that the Council of Ministers for Transport has decided that a working group will present an initial report on 15 October, not only on the most immediate safety measures that are being taken in airports and in aircraft but also on the need to conclude an agreement, especially with our American partners, on rapidly defining measures to improve the safety of air transport.
I also wish to say that these issues will be discussed by representatives of the European Union at the General Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which opens on 25 September.
With regard to political decisions - for example, the two framework decisions that the Commission has just approved - it is quite clear that unanimity could prove to be a tricky obstacle to overcome in Council.
The Commission has already, on several occasions, expressed its sympathy with the idea that methods of decision-making under the third pillar should be streamlined and simplified.
However, over and above the issue of unanimity, the Commission' s political position on the fight against terrorism is clear: no State must block decisions. Nevertheless, no State can opt out of the fight against terrorism.
The effectiveness of the framework decisions also depends on their being implemented uniformly in all the States of the Union without exception, because we do not want a single haven for terrorist or criminal activities to exist within the European Union.
To this end, I hope that the appeals of this Parliament and of public opinion are sufficiently strong to enable us to reach the compromise formulas necessary to improve police and judicial cooperation, which are the legitimate methods for combating terrorism in a democracy.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.
Future of cohesion policy
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the future of cohesion policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since 1988, regional policy has enjoyed undeniable success.
This success is not purely coincidental. It is the fruit of a major policy decision that favours solidarity, a decision that has resulted, in budgetary terms, in the appropriation of more than a third of Community expenditure for economic and social cohesion.
During this 2000-2006 programming period, the Commission adopted, on 31 January, the second report on economic and social cohesion in accordance with Article 159, subparagraph 2, of the Treaty.
In addition to being a pertinent account of the studies carried out and the statistical information gathered in the field of enlargement, the report contains conclusions and recommendations that should encourage debate on the future of regional policy.
Economic and social cohesion is a real issue that we should be concerned with from now on, for we have to provide answers for the next programming period starting 1 January 2007, a time when enlargement to include new Member States will be a reality.
With regard to the statistical information in the second report on cohesion, one fact stands out in our minds: enlargement will bring a challenge twice as large as the one we are currently facing, for the figures indicate that regional disparities are set to double.
In relative terms, regions that are lagging behind in their development and those which are having problems with restructuring will be greater in number and this effect will be multiplied when we are 27 Member States.
In addition, due to a simple mechanical reality, a certain number of regions in the current European Union will no longer find themselves on the list of problem regions although their true economic situation has not really improved.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our attention needs to be focused on two crucial questions.
The first question is whether enlargement is conceivable without a powerful structure and cohesion policy.
The second question is how the policy on economic and social cohesion should in future continue to focus on regions that lag behind current Member States developmentally, and what are the objectives that need to be met.
Both questions were extensively dealt with during the informal Regional Policy Council which was held recently in Namur on 13 July last.
With regard to the first question, everyone has accepted that enlargement will bring with it a substantial increase in needs in terms of social and economic cohesion.
That was also clearly underlined in the Commission' s second report on economic and social cohesion.
The figures in the report speak for themselves.
Following on enlargement, discrepancies will become more pronounced in two ways.
Firstly, the section of the population in regions with a Gross Domestic Product per capita that is less than 75% of the current EU average will double, and that means that the number of inhabitants that fall within the scope of present objective 1 of the Structural Funds will increase from 19% in the EU of Fifteen Members to 36% in an EU comprising twenty-seven Member States.
Secondly, discrepancies will increase in extent.
Today' s average Gross Domestic Product per capita in the underprivileged regions stands at 66% of the EU average.
If one adds to this the less developed regions of the candidate countries, the average Gross Domestic Product per capita drops back to less than half of the EU average, to only 77% to be precise.
On the basis of the above data, one can conclude that with enlargement, the cohesion problem doubles in terms of its original scope and its original extent.
Poverty and inequality are persistent problems and we realise that we will need to fight them for a long time yet to come.
Even if the candidate countries were to grow faster than the amalgamated countries have done in the past ten years, even then, the current level of the Gross Domestic Product per capita would imply a convergence process spanning at least two generations.
Even with the Irish rate of growth of the past ten years, it would take twenty years to reach 90% of the Gross Domestic Product per capita of the fifteen EU Member States.
It is from that perspective that today' s priorities and objectives of our regional policy must be viewed.
Even the management itself of the outlined package of measures is an important element, in the sense that we should not overlook the fact that at present, most candidate countries do not have appropriate structures in place to manage properly the regional policy in the way we in most cases propose.
Having said that, during the informal Council in Namur, we were given a clear signal that it is necessary to continue to support the current underprivileged regions in the European Union.
The present objectives pertaining to the underprivileged regions, both in the Member States and in the candidate countries, must be supported in a fair manner.
That will inevitably need to go hand in hand with an even more efficient deployment of Community resources.
There is therefore unanimity as regards the continuation of the present regional policy concerning those regions which continue to face structural difficulties.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the coherence of the actions to be taken, the Fifteen support a strengthening of this coherence at all levels, particularly between the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, with a more specific focus being given to interventions.
Furthermore, requests for additional assessments, particularly on the efficiency of the current system, have been drawn up by certain Member States before they are prepared to advance further in the determination of procedures and mechanisms that will govern the future of economic and social cohesion policy.
These procedures and mechanisms will be the subject of a global proposal from the Commission in 2004, in its third report on economic and social cohesion.
In any case, it is clear that projects and action supported by the economic and social cohesion policy are particularly important to European citizens.
This contributes to the process of bringing citizens closer to European institutions and policies.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission, by publishing the second report on economic and social cohesion, has paved the way for an important debate on the future of the European Union' s structural operations policy.
The Council, during the informal meeting on regional policy that took place in Namur, listened very carefully to the presentation made by Commissioner Barnier. The Council then debated the issue in a calm atmosphere where everybody had the chance to speak and be heard.
The discussions focused on questions of substance, in a climate that was generally positive.
However, no definitive option has yet been decided on.
To do this, the questions asked in the second report need to be looked at in much greater detail.
The Commission will continue its analysis and will encourage debate by organising working parties for each issue.
The results of this will be used in the drafting of a third report, expected in 2004.
At this point, it will be sent back to the Council and Parliament, on the basis of the Commission' s proposals, to be used at an earlier stage in the development of the future framework of cohesion policy.
Mr President, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure that I can personally bring you up to date, as I am sure you were hoping I would, on the great debate we started on 31 January in this very place, when I came to present you with the second report on economic and social cohesion that the Commission had just approved.
On that occasion we, in addition to this presentation, started a debate that I said, and I am anxious to repeat on this very occasion, would be sincere, objective, without any issue being taboo, on one of the great Community policies at the very heart of the perception that we have of our European Union, for it relates to the policy of solidarity.
Since 31 January, the debate has been stoked by new contributions.
I am thinking in particular of the Cohesion Forum of 21 and 22 May, organised right here thanks to the European Parliament, in agreement with your President and with the support of my colleagues Anna Diamantopoulou and Franz Fischler.
At the same time, enlargement negotiations are progressing with all candidate countries.
Enlargement, as you know, is one of the main themes of this debate.
I would like to reiterate now that we must make a clear distinction between accession negotiations, which are based on the application of the acquis communautaire in new Member States, and the reform of structural policies for the period following 2006.
The debate that I am inviting you to participate in mainly focuses on the period after 2006.
We are, of course, not calling into question what current Member States receive from the Structural Funds from now until 2006.
Your Parliament, in requesting the Commission to give its opinion, wanted to take stock of this debate.
I would like to thank you, therefore, for this opportunity and thus quickly mention certain points.
Firstly, the forum we held on 21 and 22 May was an opportunity for genuine debate, paving the way for other such moments.
Since 31 January, the presentation of conclusions from the cohesion report has been, for both myself and my colleagues from the Directorate-General on Regional Policy, a priority.
You can be sure that I will fully participate in this debate, week after week, at ground level.
Last Friday in Helsinki, for example, I met the twenty Finnish regional Presidents. Tomorrow and the day after, in Oporto, I will attend an assembly of the conference of peripheral maritime regions, where we will discuss this future cohesion policy.
In this way, the debate should spread, should move away from the political centre in such a way that it provides firstly the Member States and then Brussels with a certain number of ideas, requests, proof and guidelines.
The 21 May forum was a very important moment for me and one that taught many lessons.
It brought together a number of ministers, several former prime ministers, current prime ministers, representatives from regions and towns, not only from the fifteen Member States but also from the candidate countries, and many very high-level contributions.
I would like to bring to light three aspects of these contributions and the discussion that Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck mentioned earlier, that I held in Namur with the fifteen ministers in charge of regional policy, on the invitation of the Belgian Presidency.
Firstly, the interest the future of this policy after 2006 arouses in all Member States and candidate countries, and the insistence of many on the truly political dimension of European solidarity.
This is not solely a question of money.
It is also the expression, as you very clearly stated, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, on behalf of the Presidency, of possibly the most concrete, the most precise and visible of the values upon which the European Union is founded.
The proof that our Union is not just a large free trade area or single market, but also a community of solidarity that should one day be a political force.
Secondly, I have had no negative feedback regarding the enlargement process.
There is concern, of course, but also a sense of the European Union' s historic obligation and interest in both new and old Member States in assisting in the long-lasting and balanced development of the whole European continent.
Thirdly, I have also measured the importance, in order for this debate to succeed, of not forgetting the needs of regions in States that are current members of the EU.
I would like once again to state my conviction: we are not of the opinion that by admitting very poor regions in Eastern Europe - Estonia, Slovenia, Poland, Bulgaria and others - into the European Union, that regions that are poor or that are experiencing difficulties in the north, the centre, the south, not to mention the outermost regions, will become rich as if by waving a magic wand.
After enlargement there will be problems and needs in the EU as it currently stands.
So, ladies and gentlemen, here we have what constitutes, when all is considered, strong encouragement for the maintenance of a cohesion policy that is suited to the new economic challenges and future geography of Europe.
My second point concerns procedures for the future.
As you know, the Commission has committed itself, following requests from the Council in June, to provide it with a regular report on the development of its work on future cohesion policy.
This information, which I must give to the Council, I must also, naturally, give to the European Parliament.
I will propose to the Commission that it adopt the first of these regular interim reports at the very beginning of next year, in January, as soon as we have new statistics available. These statistics will explain, update and clarify the information that is already available in the cohesion report.
I would like to point out that these new statistics, supplied by Eurostat, will involve, for example, the GDP per capita in 1999, and unemployment statistics for the year 2000.
Therefore, the more up-to-date these figures are, the more serious and objective the debate will be.
This interim report for the month of January will therefore contain an update of figures and analyses from the first part of the cohesion report devoted to the situation of regions, but it will also present the results of different studies that we have commissioned, as well as lessons learned from the great debates and seminars that have been organised.
I can give more details regarding the additional studies commissioned: we have commissioned a study of the situation of the islands, as well as a study on the macroeconomic impact of Structural Funds.
With regard to this macroeconomic study, I shall be very eager to provide you with information on the impact of these Structural Funds in terms of the direct impact of the use of these funds in net contributing countries.
I also plan to commission an additional study on the situation of mountainous regions or regions that have long-term natural handicaps.
In order to stimulate this debate, seminars will be organised during the first half of 2002 on each of the ten Community priorities that have been identified in the cohesion report, with the participation of experts from the Member States and regions who we shall invite in accordance with the various issues.
My third point involves, whilst still talking about the future, the basis of the debate.
On the subject of the basis of the debate, I would like to express, or state once more, three convictions.
My first conviction is that within the coming context of this EU enlargement, the Member States and regions will feel the need for more Community cohesion policy and not less.
I do not think that a form of unravelling or renationalisation of regional policy should be the way to respond to this requirement, to this need for cohesion in an enlarged EU where there will be - and the figures speak for themselves - more disparities than today.
But I am equally resolutely in favour, while reaffirming this need for cohesion and planning these new cohesion and regional policies, to find, with your help, a way to achieve more decentralisation, simplification, and less bureaucracy.
As far as we can, I will, using current European procedures, be anxious to search for and propose all means of moving further towards simplification and decentralisation.
My second conviction is financial in nature. Even if the financial debate is, strictly speaking, premature today, I am not the only one to consider, as I already said here in a personal capacity, that a financial effort that would globally represent any less than 0.45 % of EU GDP would, in my view, call into question the credibility of the future cohesion policy.
I think therefore that I can state once more that, in my opinion, we cannot, without calling into question the credibility of this cohesion policy, fall below this threshold of 0.45 % which is a threshold universally accepted by the Heads of State and Government in Berlin.
My third conviction is that future cohesion policy should be fair and non-discriminatory.
It should, therefore, be directed towards all regions that have structural difficulties of whatever nature and deal with questions in a heterogeneous fashion, that is to say, regions that are very backward in terms of development, that happen to be mostly in candidate countries, as well as regions within the current Fifteen that have not truly succeeded in the process of true convergence and for which it would be a good idea, at an opportune moment, to find some means of fair treatment, so that they are not penalised by a purely statistical or mechanical effect linked to a threshold or to new methods applied within the framework of the enlarged EU, in order to deal with the problems of certain areas which have particular handicaps or certain worrying social issues such as equal opportunities or the situation of urban areas.
In conclusion, Mr President, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that the report we shall put forward at the beginning of next year will take its inspiration from the results of the great debates held in the second half of this year.
This is just the first of the meetings I have proposed to hold with you.
There will be others before I present you with the third cohesion report in 2004.
It is in this frame of mind that I shall be entirely available today and in the forthcoming weeks to listen to your suggestions, your recommendations and your criticisms.
Mr President, I do not think anything impressively new can come out of this debate on regional policy quite simply, in my personal opinion, because the time is not right, it is not newsworthy, if you like.
In all events, given that many of the Members are interested in this particular subject and given that regional policy accounts yet again for 35% of the budget, this confirms, I think, just how important it is to the European Union and, in this sense, there is perhaps some point to the debate.
The second point I wish to make is that perhaps it would be a good idea at some point - and this is certainly the intention of the Committee on Regional Policy - to discuss the state of progress of projects and programmes under the Community Support Framework in individual countries, because I personally am not at all convinced that everything is going swimmingly in every country, not through any fault of the Commission's, but through the fault of certain Member States.
I do not wish to speak of dramatic delays but I am sure that certain countries are having problems.
As far as the future of cohesion policy is concerned, a debate was started following the second cohesion report by the European Commission and I think that certain conclusions are already obvious, that is, that far more regions will need to be covered, that in regions in the Member States which are already covered there will appear to be an artificial increase in GNP, which does not mean that they will automatically become rich, as the Commissioner has said, and that it goes without saying that more appropriations are needed but that it does not go without saying that it will be easy to find these appropriations.
As far as I can see, the conclusions are more or less obvious.
First, we must not leave things in the lap of the Gods, we must not take decisions at the eleventh hour, because we could bring the European Union to what may well be an explosive situation.
Secondly, we need to concentrate from 2006 onwards on those in real need.
Thirdly, we must not create shock waves in regions which stop being covered, because that will give rise to euro-scepticism in these regions.
Having said which, I have two unpleasant things to say, one of which is unpleasant for the poorer countries and the other of which is unpleasant for the richer countries.
For the poorer countries, I think that we need to find ways of making the most of appropriations by introducing suitable mechanisms, incentives and, if necessary, sanctions so that the money actually goes somewhere.
And for the richer countries, we need to rethink the overall logic of the Community budget so as to find a way of increasing appropriations, because there will be a huge increase in requirements and regional policy will, as the Commissioner has said, have no credibility whatsoever if we fall below a certain point.
Mr President, Commissioner, you will be aware that the Regional and Transport Committee has started its deliberations on social and economic cohesion via the second cohesion report and that this report launches the debate on how we face up to the challenges of regional funding and structural policy in an enlarged Europe.
However, whilst I am grateful for the Commissioner's statement today, my group is still disappointed with the Commission as it appears that it has not used its right of initiative and has not engaged itself fully on this topic.
It raises the question as to what the real proposals of the Commission are.
Commissioner Barnier referred to the meeting in May in which many Members participated, but again nothing concrete seems to have come out of that meeting.
On our side of the political divide, we recognised at an early stage how sensitive this issue could be and indeed our experience of Agenda 2000 was the catalyst that told us this.
But then Commissioner Wulf-Matthies facilitated a common position with Parliament and so we feel that the time is now right for us to start work with the Commission as it becomes more active, positive and decisive.
My group has discussed in detail the questions that you have posed.
The main points emanating from our discussion revolve around the principle of keeping the concept of social and economic cohesion and its most representative instrument, namely the Cohesion Fund.
But a thorough discussion is required on implementing the goals of the cohesion policy before we make any decisions on the future financing of structural aid.
At the moment, we are facing a number of great challenges and any discussion on the implementation of Cohesion Fund has to include other areas under the umbrella of sustainable development, such as employment and agriculture.
We must continue to ensure that the poorer regions that presently receive structural aid are not mistreated in the future and that Community initiatives, such INTERREG and URBAN, are retained.
We also question whether 1.27% of the Community GDP, as was decided on in Agenda 2000, is enough with regard to the new Cohesion Fund.
In launching this debate, it is our view that our discussions would have been more fruitful and more meaningful if the Commission had come forward with ideas of its own so that it could act as a facilitator of those discussions.
We know that it is an important issue.
At the moment, we are left with a series of questionnaires, but we can give the Commissioner a guarantee that our group will be fully involved in discussions in the coming months.
Mr President, the debate on the future of the cohesion policy is a very timely one.
I wish to thank the Commission for its willingness to share this debate with Parliament and, at the same time, for the visits undertaken to Member States.
They are very necessary.
My concern is not just how regional policy can be made to work effectively both in the present Member States and in the countries that have applied for membership but also the continuation of structural policy in the present Member States in the next Structural Funds period.
Structural Funds policy is currently managed in too cumbersome a manner.
Now is a good time to consider, for example, how we might learn from the delay in the preparatory procedures for programmes for the next period.
How can we become more effective, achieve better results and reduce bureaucracy?
In this connection I would also like to enquire what the Commission' s position is regarding what enlargement means for the overall funding of structural policy.
Is the Commission prepared to increase structural policy appropriations during the next Structural Funds period should the situation regarding European economic and social cohesion so demand?
At the same time I would also like to communicate to the Commission that a funding model for enlargement is not acceptable where those having to pay would be the poor regions of the existing EU countries, where there are still lasting problems owing to difficult natural conditions, long distances or sparse populations.
The EU must also show solidarity in the future so that new money with a new financial instrument can be found for the new challenges of structural policy, where those that pay would include those central regions that will be the first to benefit economically from enlargement.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cohesion policy is indeed the greatest challenge facing the Community in the context of enlargement.
At the same time, cohesion policy will be the litmus test of whether stability can successfully be maintained in an EU of 27 Member States and, moreover, in all its parts.
The tendency has, however, prevailed in the Member States not to assess the success of cohesion policy in the less favoured areas, but rather to evaluate success in terms of how much they end up getting for themselves out of each negotiation.
Clearly, this must change from 2006 onwards!
Stability and the successful development of an enlarged Union will be guaranteed after 2006 only if common objective criteria rather than the protection of possession constitute the precondition for the allocation of funds.
This means that a new, common cohesion policy must be tested in its entirety against the old policy.
The second report on cohesion contains some good proposals, but it perpetuates many of the cohesion policy's errors and is no radical programme of reform.
I will say a bit more about the proposals.
I think it right and proper that all regions of the enlarged Union should be assessed on an equal basis provided there is no simultaneous impact on regions which are currently being supported.
So I wholeheartedly support the principle of phasing out.
Increased decentralisation and the promotion of partnership must, however, apply also to the acceding countries in the accession funds - and right now - so that their authorities get some practical experience of them.
Phasing-in the acceding countries into a decentralised structural policy as early as 2002 is also necessary in order to pool experience.
Even in half measures, an integrated regional policy is the only thing in which donors, too, can have confidence.
Quality must therefore come before quantity!
Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I consider the policy of economic and social cohesion to be one of the European Union's undoubted achievements, attesting as it does the principle of solidarity between the highly-developed regions and the weak ones.
Of course, on further analysis of the way structural policy has worked to date, it has to be said that it has a lot of inadequacies.
Firstly: The divergence between Member States may well have decreased, but the differences within them - between highly-developed regions and weak ones - have increased.
Secondly: The unemployment rate in the weak regions has not significantly decreased.
Thirdly: The average per capita income of the wealthiest regions, which make up 10% of the Union's population, is still 2.6 times higher than in the regions in which 10% of the poorest inhabitants live.
Fourthly: The underdeveloped regions still do not possess self-supporting economic and social cycles.
They therefore have enormous problems when it comes to actually reducing the amount by which they lag behind the developed areas.
Fifthly: You yourselves can see that the commitment appropriations yet to be settled totalled almost EUR 42 billion at the end of 1999, in other words the Structural Fund's input for specific projects is inefficient!
This means that other measures, even other projects, must be deliberately chosen, something which can, of course, only be done in collaboration with the Member States.
Whatever the shortcomings, the enormous amount of change cannot be overlooked.
Differences would otherwise be markedly greater.
This also means that we must carry on with the Structural Fund policy.
You have just said, Mr Barnier, that there must be no taboos.
Too true!
All the Member States said more or less the same thing at the informal meeting in Namur, and proposals were submitted.
But sooner or later, we must get to the point. At some juncture, it will have to be said that these proposals cost X amount of money, and we must either make it available or we have to admit that we are not going to.
This cannot be put off for ever and a day.
You will be aware that the upper limit equals 1.27% of GDP within the financial perspective for 2000 to 2006.
Where are we in real terms?
At 1.06%.
You can hardly call that putting real structural policy into practice!
It is also because of Parliament...
(Interruption by Mr Jarzembowski) No, I am not only accusing the Commissioner; we put up with this sort of thing all the time!
Not my Group, though; we have always submitted the relevant amendments.
Perhaps, Mr Jarzembowski, the PPE-DE Group would like to join in next time, then we should almost make up a majority!
In the context of this discussion, we must also of course bear in mind that there are very special regions.
I regret to have to say, Commissioner, that the border regions programme imposed by the Commission is utterly inadequate!
Perhaps we will have to give some thought to doing something similar...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, Commissioner, the Cohesion Fund was created in order to prepare the structurally weak countries of the EU for economic and monetary union.
The cohesion countries have substantially caught up over the past few years and they all participate in EMU.
I would therefore observe that this objective of the Cohesion Fund has been attained.
Despite this, Agenda 2000 decided that the Cohesion Fund should continue.
Would it not have been consistent to let the Cohesion Fund expire, not abruptly perhaps but by its being phased out?
The eastward enlargement means that the EU's present cohesion policy cannot be continued with any longer.
We all know that eastward enlargement will not be for free, and this must be said frankly.
Apart from that, I too believe that much is going wrong with our cohesion policy as regards efficiency, administrative costs and this policy's vulnerability to deception.
What the cohesion policy needs is a fundamental debate about its strengths and weaknesses, that is, about its possible reform.
I know that this is a difficult debate, being about our patrimony.
But it is also about a quite fundamental question: what, in the EU, does solidarity mean?
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I too will take up your suggestion that this issue should be discussed without taboos.
I do not believe that there is actually anybody in this House who is opposed to a cohesion policy.
The question we must ask ourselves is whether a cohesion policy would not be better conducted without a Cohesion Fund.
There are two problems, the first being that, if the accessions were to take place, then, logically, all the acceding States, being the poorest countries and States, would have to join the Cohesion Fund.
You cannot say that there is a regional policy for all, a Cohesion Fund for four countries and all the rest can fit in somewhere else!
No, so if the Cohesion Fund were to be maintained, it would have to apply to all the acceding countries.
It is my personal view, however, that cohesion policy can be carried on better through the medium of general regional and structural policy and without a Cohesion Fund, as the Cohesion Fund seems to me to suffer from the drawback that it turns its attention to States rather than to regions.
It is not the States that we want to support, however, but disadvantaged regions.
It is for this reason, Commissioner, that I believe this issue should again be considered very carefully.
I believe, secondly, that we too should, as you have always said, distinguish between substantial reforms and the question of how much money we want to end up spending on them.
We must, in my view, come to a quick decision about the substance, as the acceding States have a right to be told before 2002/2003 what the cohesion policy situation is going to be if they are Members by then.
Commissioner, I am not sure that I understood you right: I find your model good in itself.
You are saying that there are standard criteria for all regions - one or two, shall we say - then there is phasing out for the regions that used to be supported but no longer can be because of the new criteria or simply because there is no more money.
The question now arises: by what criteria should support actually be given in future?
I myself would be prepared to talk in terms of one or two, or even three, criteria.
I have, though, the slight suspicion - which you hinted at earlier - that there will subsequently be ten.
So one takes a look to see what criterion fits the region.
Oh look, there are a few mountains, so this is a mountain region.
And this place has island status, so we shall call it an island region!
I think it better to take any old percentage - GDP plus, perhaps, the unemployment situation, for example.
If one takes that a step further and says that the balance of the sexes or the standard of education of men and women are to be counted as general criteria, then - if I may say so - things get a bit jumbled.
So please let us carry on our discussions, as you said you would.
We are on your side and look forward to continuing the debate with you.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I wish to express my support for those who have said that this debate must not be about the safeguarding of possession, but about aid for those who need it most.
I also want to say frankly that, in my considered opinion, nobody must close his eyes to the fact that enlargement is going to present us all with great challenges, those of a financial nature among them.
The Germans learned their lesson through reunification, when the citizens were told at first that it would involve no fiscal burdens for them.
This was demonstrably false.
Let there be no misunderstandings - of course we want enlargement.
But we must squarely face the consequences for structural policy.
We should not simply be told 'as you were' , and I do not believe that we will be.
If we are not to forfeit the trust of people in the affected regions, we must point this out clearly, honestly and at an early stage.
If there is not to be a rude awakening, we must explore the possibilities of full support for the candidate countries in building up their infrastructure and, at the same time, concern ourselves with continuing to bring the weakest regions of the Fifteen up to the average.
The success of this will depend on making certain changes which would have been required even without enlargement.
First, there is the fact that the cohesion countries can point to very variable results from the catching-up process, and it is evident that the greatest successes were achieved where the actors were on the spot and shared a commitment to maximising the efficiency of the support.
Moreover, project evaluation needs further improvement and efficient management needs greater rewards than in the past if the effectiveness of the means employed is to be assessed.
Last but not least, there is no getting away from the need for closer dovetailing with the other EU policies, in particular the common agricultural policy.
I believe that both targets can be reached through the decentralisation and simplification that Mr Barnier has mentioned.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would firstly like to say that I am in favour of the two reports, which provide us with a good analysis of the application of both the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds in 1999.
On the basis of the analysis contained in these two reports, I would like to refer to three points.
The first is obvious: the cohesion policy comes within European Union policy and a fundamental element of that cohesion policy is the funds which we are discussing here.
The regions which are at a lower level than the European Union average cannot do without these funds, with or without enlargement.
It is therefore inherent to the European Union' s cohesion policy that the least-developed regions of the Union receive funds and resources so that they can try to eliminate the current territorial imbalances.
As has been said, there is still a budgetary margin in the Union which can be used to meet these needs.
The second point is that these reports refer to 1999.
There are a series of criticisms about application, which should be taken into account.
Let us hope that in 2001, thanks to the action of the Commissioner and his team, the restrictions and shortcomings pointed out may be eliminated.
Thirdly, we must bear in mind that the series of statistics analysed and the studies done on the long-term application of the funds in the European Union, with very few exceptions, demonstrate that in the least-favoured regions the level of imbalance in relation to the European Union average has been reduced.
Therefore, since we are talking about the future application of these funds, this must be taken into account in the Union' s new policies in this field.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like all of you, I am very pleased that both the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner responsible for territorial policy have agreed firstly that it will be necessary in the future, with enlargement, to have a dual cohesion policy, although it is of a minority nature: the cohesion policy for the regions belonging to the fifteen current Members and the supplementary cohesion policy for the enlargement countries.
I also note that they agreed on an issue which seems to me essential and in no way hypocritical: there can be no political Europe without an economic Europe, there can be no political Europe without a cohesion policy.
That is also the case in the current States, and the European Union must assume these responsibilities in the future.
How can it be done?
How can it be achieved and with what instruments?
We clearly have to improve the current application of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund.
We only have to look at the differences between Ireland and Spain, in terms of results over past years, or between Portugal and Italy or Greece, if you will allow me.
The application has been different, and as such Ireland has made extraordinary progress and Portugal has taken better advantage of the Structural Funds than many other States.
This has not been the case with Spain, Italy or Greece, where, while State income has come closer to the Community average, this has not been the case in their internal regions, which indicates that the Funds are being badly applied, possibly because the State has taken advantage of the funds intended for the regions or because the policy of additionality has not been applied in the State.
Mr Barnier, you have said, and you had said previously, that the Structural and Cohesion Funds cannot be below 0.46% of Community GDP.
I would remind you that this is the level they had in 1999 and that in 2006 it will be 0.31%.
If in 1999, in view of the result, we had not managed to eliminate differences between the regions of Europe by means of these Funds, we must therefore be much more ambitious than you are proposing, although you have done so in a very positive way.
Mr President, Commissioner, the question before us is what line our cohesion policy should follow in the new perspective that is opening up with enlargement.
There are two parts to the response: on the one hand, the principles on which cohesion policies are to be based from 2006 onwards must be established and, on the other hand, the priorities must be set.
In my opinion, there are two principles which must underpin cohesion policy: firstly, equal opportunities, and secondly, regionalisation.
Modern economic theory teaches us, with a wealth of detail and supported by considerable empirical evidence, that the success of local development policies is strictly linked to an increase in the power of individuals to take autonomous decisions and to the projects for implementing regional policies which are acceptable to those voters.
In the same way, talking about regionalisation is the same as defining economic policies at local level so that they respect and appreciate the different assets of each region, and so that the local government institutions, subject to monitoring by the electorate making them politically accountable, can take collective decisions backed by genuine democratic support.
The achievement of these goals certainly requires a different type of statistic on the state of the economies, at both local and national and Community level.
Data on per capita income are no longer sufficient to assess individuals' opportunities for access in the European regions; we need much more: we need indicators which measure the degree of access to resources, indicators which measure the level of economic freedoms, which measure the level of fundamental human rights, which measure, in short, the quality of life.
Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the cohesion policy is an integral component of the European Union.
The European Union will not make progress in growing together if solidarity does not always play some part.
We all know that those who are stronger and richer must help those who are poorer or not yet as strong or in the process of catching up.
We are talking today about what was to be seen over the last few years and, of course, also about the conclusions we must draw from that for the years to come.
Today, I want to take a look at the current state of our cohesion policy, in other words: how are we spending the money we have allocated to this truly vital EU policy?
Right up to Agenda 2000, we used to have the stormiest debates about how much money was to be spent.
If, though, we now look at how implementation is actually proceeding, we cannot but have grave doubts as to whether this is being taken seriously enough.
The new aid period began last year, so, of course, things cannot move as fast at the outset as they can halfway down the track, but it must be pointed out all the same that implementation is proceeding at a wretched rate in the various fields. There is simply no other way of putting it.
This has been a frequent topic in the Committee on Budgets, and even the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has taken it up and will continue to discuss it.
Looking at current discussions in the context of the Budget consultations - and here I must address my remarks to the Council - we see that the Council has allocated only 1% for next year's new liabilities, and that is then supposed to be converted into payments.
One per cent of all we are prepared to commit, that is supposed to be paid out!
We are producing a backlog, of the sort that we often used to have.
We are piling up funds rather than fast-tracking aid, and fast aid is good aid, because we want many countries and regions no longer to need aid when enlargement actually comes about.
If we really want to help them out of their plight, if we really want to make room for the new countries who want to join us, we must give aid fast and in concentrated form, in other words: there must be appropriate follow-up here.
I call upon the Commission - which has already submitted proposals on this - but also upon the Council, to follow up words with actions, for cohesion is only any good as and when it actually reaches people, and that needs to be as soon as possible!
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will first address a word of thanks to you, Commissioner, for your lucid words and your declaration that, in the context of economic and social cohesion, both the new problems of the candidates for accession and the continuing problems of the present 15 Member States are being appropriately taken into account in various regions.
Secondly, a word of thanks also for emphasising again that there are no taboos in this discussion.
We are at the beginning of this discussion process and, in this discussion, we should explore in depth all the options for auditing the Structural Funds.
Holding 27 countries together economically and socially is a quite different matter from maintaining the cohesion of 15 of them.
The solid fact is that the accession of 12 new States will substantially increase the disparities in the EU.
On the one hand, the new Member States will have to be given priority, whilst on the other, the present beneficiary countries must not be denied a degree of continuity.
We are well aware that the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Fund can still only be temporary measures and cannot be made part of the patrimony.
However, regions must not lose their Objective 1 status after 2006 solely on the grounds that enlargement has brought an improvement in their relative position and without their having achieved sustainable development.
I see the cohesion policy as being credible only if the financial means are apportioned on the basis of objective criteria applicable to all, with the criteria of national and regional prosperity forming the bases.
The pending review of European regional policy must therefore throw up some solutions, and that is the whole point of the discussion process that is now beginning - to treat on an equal footing the situations both in the new Member States and in the Objective 1 regions of the present Member States.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, in view of what one Member said, I believe that this is a very appropriate time to discuss economic and social cohesion.
Let us hope that this notion transcends European borders and is applied to other regions.
This would probably be a solution to many conflicts.
While it is true that this is a good time for the debate, I must also recognise that, at least in my opinion, the responses from the Council and the Commission are unsatisfactory.
Firstly, I find it difficult to believe that we can talk about social and economic cohesion without making the least reference to the single market and all the policies of the European Union.
We are currently negotiating the Sixth Framework Programme, a programme which from the outset does not fulfil the cohesive conditions required of it by the Treaties.
Economic and social cohesion demands that we take it into account in all our policies.
Mr President, Mr Barnier asked this Parliament certain questions in this report.
When we asked the Council these same questions, it indicated that this was not the appropriate time to answer them, but Parliament has the right to ask the Commission and the Council these questions so that we might know their opinion, before producing our report.
I profoundly and fundamentally disagree with the Council' s attitude, and to a lesser extent with that of the Commissioner, because I believe that certain fundamental issues must be clarified immediately.
We are talking about how the 2006 project is going to affect various regions in the future.
If we do not do so we will constantly be talking in theory about this issue and we will never bring about the reform necessary for economic and social cohesion in Europe, because we will be looking askance at one another: some of us talking about how we have to remove the Cohesion Fund, others saying that certain regions have to leave it.
This confusion will prevent us from getting down to a thorough analysis of the issue.
Mr President, honourable Members, as we all know, the European Union considers that economic and social cohesion between the regions is quintessential to life and has quantified this objective by setting a minimum cohesion target of 75% of the average per capita income of the 15 Member States.
At the same time, and quite rightly too, our European Union has decided to integrate new Member States whose per capita income is demonstrably lower.
Is it logical, is it ethical and, hence, is it acceptable in the final analysis for the second objective to be achieved at the expense of the first? By which I mean that enlargement will reduce the new average per capita income considerably.
The upside, of course, is that at least everyone realises that cohesion policy cannot continue with blinkers on as regards the 75% target and hence various scenarios have been proposed and are being debated, scenarios which may provide a way out but which are not a fair solution.
It therefore makes sense, it is obvious in my book, to retain the first objective even for the enlarged European Union. In other words, all Member States, old and new, must exceed 75% of the average per capita income of the present 15 Member States.
That would be consistent.
Naturally enlargement will need more money than it appears to have.
So those who need to should take a realistic view of the new situation, they should approach it with an open mind, they should take a long-term view of the cost-benefit ratio of a revised, ambitious regional policy and they should not disappoint regions which continue to require help from Europe, from the Europe of their dreams, the Europe they believe in.
We must realise, as did Demosthenes, one of the great figures of ancient Greece, when he said in ancient Greek, "... money, without it nothing we need to do can be done."
And if the decisions have already been taken, well decisions are made to be revised.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Marques and Mr Nogueira Román pointed out in their respective reports, the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds are of fundamental importance to the development of most EU regions, both in terms of infrastructures and from the point of view of social integration.
The fact remains that, despite the budgetary aid granted, European regions are far from being on an equal footing in terms of development. My colleague Mr Fruteau is especially concerned about the outermost regions.
You will therefore understand that this current context of enlargement makes me fear that the European Union has its attention exclusively focused towards the East, which would be disastrous for a good number of European regions that are current beneficiaries.
Please understand me: I am not trying to call into question the pertinence of enlargement, which, of course, means the consolidation of peace on our continent, which in these difficult times, is a noble and fragile objective.
On the contrary, I am thinking about the conditions in which it can succeed.
I am, in fact, one of those who think that the success of enlargement will be the result of the strengthening of cohesion.
But this cohesion has a price that should not be paid by the EU' s poorest countries.
In concrete terms, Commissioner, I hope that the eligibility criteria of Objectives 1 and 2 will be very carefully revised in order that the poverty of some does not lead to the end of hope and the impoverishment of others.
Enlargement is a great challenge.
It is one of solidarity.
It will not be surmounted unless it is understood and accepted. Let us not forget this fact.
Mr President, the statements we have heard from the Council and from Commissioner Barnier and the speeches of all the Members have confirmed without a shadow of a doubt that cohesion policies are one of the fundamental pillars of the Union and that enlargement requires us not only to continue to pursue these policies but also to consolidate them.
However, I feel that the crucial issues are different and I will list some of them.
Firstly, are the instruments we have used in recent years to regulate what are becoming increasingly marked imbalances still sufficiently up-to-date?
Can generic indicators such as the GDP or simplistic percentages such as 75% continue to be the only parameters for clarifying and classifying eligibility?
Is a fictional blanket paradigm in which the same measures are adopted across the board for subjects and contexts which are only similar in terms of statistics, still viable?
Secondly, do the key principles of subsidiarity and additionality have the same meaning today as they had 20 years ago, when the European Union had a different institutional system?
Is the idea, put forward in recent days by Mr Giuliano Amato, the former Italian Prime Minister, of far-reaching innovation leaving the European Commission power over major strategic investments and decentralising regional development actions really so unrealistic and impossible?
It is my genuine hope that the participants in the debate held over the forthcoming months will have the courage to address these issues as well.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, cohesion is a fundamental pillar of the European Union.
In fact, there can be no political cohesion in the European Union without economic and social cohesion, despite what some of the federalists may think.
On the other hand, however, there can be no economic and social cohesion without political cohesion, as hard as this may be for some nationalists to swallow.
Cohesion policy, which has played a key role in recent years, will have an even more crucial role to play in future, as a result of enlargement.
Cohesion policy is really a prerequisite for enlargement' s success.
This goes without saying.
Nevertheless, Mr President, there are certain paradoxes inherent in enlargement: by making the European Union poorer in terms of average per capita income, we will be making the countries that are currently the least favoured richer as if by some form of numerical magic.
This is a problem.
What my country, Portugal, and other cohesion countries cannot accept is, as a consequence of enlargement, being relegated to the margins of cohesion policy and becoming the victims of the statistical machinery that automatically places them over the critical threshold of 75%.
With this in mind, I feel that future cohesion policy must not stray from the following principles:
firstly: increasing the budgetary resources earmarked for cohesion; we cannot evade this issue, despite what Mr Walter has said;
secondly, guaranteeing that the interests of the current least favoured regions and countries are not touched and that a fair method will be found so that they continue to benefit from the level of support they receive today;
thirdly: a thorough reform of the common agricultural policy and greater protection of the rural world;
fourthly: the definition and implementation of a development strategy for Europe that relieves the congestion from current urban centres, which are dense and concentrated, to the benefit of the whole of Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate has essentially been an exploratory and orientation debate concerned with future developments in structural and cohesion policy, as you expected.
I listened to it very carefully.
We will, of course, take good account of the observations you have made.
However, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on this occasion I am going to limit myself to just this brief reaction.
Mr President, like Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, I also listened very carefully to the observations made during the debate, which will be of no great surprise to you.
Personally, I myself had hoped, at this stage, at the very start of the debate, for a great deal of frankness, criticisms, as I said earlier, and suggestions.
All the same, if you would allow me, I would like to say that I was disappointed by the remarks made by Mr Simpson earlier.
I think they are particularly unfair.
In a different way, Mr Izquierdo Collado has also shown a degree of impatience.
With this in mind, I would ask each one of you, however, to be fair to the Commission.
Since Mr Simpson wanted us to hark back to the past, by citing the name of a woman for whom I have a great deal of respect and friendship, my predecessor Mrs Wulf-Matthis, I would like to remind you of the timetable of the previous debate on the Berlin agenda.
The forum that opened the debate for the Berlin agenda took place in 1996 for a 1999 European Council meeting opening the 2000-2006 agenda.
Three years beforehand!
If I had worked to the same timetable, it is not in January 2001 that I would have set the date for the start of the debate, it would be in two years time, in 2003.
You cannot seriously be telling me today that the Commission is not aggressive enough, that you are waiting for us to make proposals.
We are opening this debate two years early without taboos, without waiting for enlargement to have taken place.
Once more, therefore, I would ask you to be fair with the Commission, and, when the time is right, after I have listened to you, listened to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the regions themselves and the Member States, you can count on me to show how bold I can be, how aggressive I can be if I have to, and to make tough proposals.
But do not ask me today to conclude a debate that has only just started, two years in advance in relation to normal procedures.
I have shown transparency. I have shown openness with the European Parliament.
And I find it quite unfair that you have come here today to reproach me.
Having said this, I would like to say to President Hatzidakis, to Mrs Schroedter, to Mr Duin, to Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and to Mr Markov, who have, if I have understood them correctly, insisted more in their speeches on current management, that I agree with many of their remarks, to their calls for better take-up, the respect of commitments, the concern for true partnership in the regions.
And I am, with the Directorate-General team, extremely concerned to ensure that the words found in the regulations - partnership, good take-up, rigour, parity, as well as others -become reality.
In a few days time I shall appear, President Hatzidakis, before your Committee to tell you where we stand on 1994-1999 and on the subject of take-up that I hope is now finalised for the previous period, where there were still funds that were not used before 1994, and also to raise the alarm on the implementation of commitments and the first take-up of appropriations in the current period.
I will make a very clear and very objective point to the Committee on Regional Policy.
Mr Markov has once again raised the issue of border regions.
I recognise, Mr Markov, that the response we gave with Mr Verheugen is not entirely satisfactory in relation to the problems of border regions, but once more in this particular case, do not ask me today for more than I can give, for we work within a framework of which you are well aware, which you have approved, which is the Berlin framework.
I have my own financial framework, which I cannot deviate from.
I shall use all the margins of flexibility and manoeuvre possible, but I am, until 2006, obliged to work within the Berlin framework, and I cannot deviate from this.
Mr Pohjamo, and others, brought up the subject of the financing of enlargement.
Mr Pohjamo, I have to tell you that it is not for the Commission to make decisions on this matter.
It is for the Council, the Council of Heads of State and Government in 2006, based on the proposals we make, and whilst we are on this subject I would like to say, as I could have said later to Mr Nogueira Román, Mr Walter, Mr Mastorakis and Mr Pittella, who talked about the aims and values of the EU as set out in this cohesion policy, I would like to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that in 2006 we will only make the right financial decisions if we first have a true and worthwhile political debate and if, naturally, within the framework of this debate and after this debate, the Commission, playing its proper role, puts forward proposals that are courageous and strong willed.
You can count on myself, Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mr Fischler to put forward the positions and proposals that will follow whilst adapting and reforming cohesion policy.
But allow me to tell you that in order to succeed with this challenge in 2004 or 2005, I need true political debate beforehand.
I need you to provide the proof right here, in your countries and in talking to people about the usefulness of this regional policy, the need for it, its effects.
If we do not provide this proof, then we should fear the ultimate financial decisions when they are made.
I would invite you, therefore, in your political groups, amongst yourselves, between countries and regions, to participate in this debate, to react to the initial course led by the Commission and to make proposals yourselves.
Mrs Raschhofer, you said we need to make reforms.
I do not know if we have understood each other, but the debate is taking place for that reason and I am hoping that it will pave the way for reforms.
In your speech, you used a word that I cannot ignore, because we must be very careful with the words we use.
You talked about fraud.
Personally, I am extremely strict. I am also ruthless on this question of rigour in the management of Structural Funds.
There are probably errors.
There are probably delays. There are often irregularities.
But I have not observed in the reports from the Court of Auditors and the Parliament' s own Committee on Budgets and Committee on Budgetary Control, that they have revealed many cases of fraud in relation to the management of Structural Funds.
As for errors, delays or irregularities, we will progressively reduce these by taking the attitude I have just pointed out.
Mr Jarzembowski has himself also started to participate in this debate, which I thank him for.
So that there is no misunderstanding, when I mentioned the territorial dimension of the future policy, you will also see, Mr Jarzembowski, that in the cohesion report, I pointed out the title 'Unity, solidarity, diversity for Europe, its people and its territory' This is perhaps an idea that we can incorporate into the new and future Objective II policy, if there is still an Objective II policy, as I hope there is, that rather than creating a bit of bureaucracy, a bit of zoning, we should decentralise this policy using several European priorities we shall choose together.
For each of these priorities, there could be a financial instrument in service, several financial instruments for the various major objectives that you have hoped and prayed for: assisting regions that have long-lasting natural handicaps, assisting urban policy, assisting cross-border cooperation.
These are a few examples of territorial objectives.
We can also find thematic goals such as the information society.
Mr Korakas, you also called for more confidence and regionalisation.
I agree.
I will make proposals in the new 2004 agenda for increased simplification and regionalisation, but, for me, the limit is to not permit the unravelling or the dismantling of this Cohesion policy which is one of the great and one of the strongest Community policies at the heart of European solidarity.
Mr Berend, like others, has made a criticism, which I accept or at least understand, on the current criteria for per capita GDP.
I am open to this type of criticism.
But I would like to say that up to this point the criterion seemed the most fair and the most objective to me.
It is accepted by all Member States.
We have reliable statistics from the instruments we have been supplied with.
And before this is changed, we should think hard so as to be as fair and as objective as we are with this criterion of per capita GDP.
Mrs Darras, let me make it clear that when the time is right, I will put forward a regional and cohesion policy that will involve all EU countries. Naturally, we shall concentrate, as we have today, on the poorest regions and countries, for this is the true meaning of cohesion, created so that we can opt out of such a scheme when we are successful.
I am not at all of the opinion that I should create a policy that would ignore other regions that have fewer difficulties but have specific projects and problems all the same, sometimes areas where there is much poverty.
I will therefore, when the time is right, propose a policy that will involve, with different degrees of intensity depending on the level of development, all regions in Europe and all countries in Europe, while endeavouring - I am responding here to Mr. Lage - to treat all of these regions even-handedly, in particular so as to avoid, Mr Lage, the mechanical effect that I myself raised in the cohesion report and the statistical effect that could, if applied without due care and attention, penalise regions currently within the EU.
Mr President, I would like to make a short personal statement in relation to the Commissioner' s comment, which I think was inappropriate and particularly unworthy of a Commissioner who normally deals with Parliament and each of its Members in an excellent way.
Perhaps there has been a misunderstanding.
All I have done, Commissioner, is ask you the same question that you asked Parliament.
You cannot therefore tell me that I am being impatient.
In January, in the second report on cohesion, you asked Parliament which of the four criteria it thought we should adopt.
Parliament asks the same of the Council and the Commission.
Secondly, Commissioner, we have enlargement to deal with.
We are talking about another time and another era.
I would like you to know, therefore, that all my comments have been made in a constructive spirit, not only today, but for many years, while fighting for cohesion in this Parliament.
Mr President, it is intolerable that people should embark on another debate when the speaking time has expired and the Commissioner has spoken.
I would ask you to prevent this in future, otherwise I too would like to speak for another two minutes.
As it is, I can only say that the Commissioner has replied very well to all our questions and that we are very grateful to him.
The debate is closed.
Cohesion Fund (1999) - Structural Funds (1999)
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism:
A5-0248/2001 by Mr Marques, on the Commission' s annual report on the Cohesion Fund 1999 [COM(2000) 822 - C5-0109/2001 - 2001/2058(COS)];
A5-0247/2001 by Mr Nogueira Román, on the Commission' s 11th annual report on the Structural Funds (1999) [COM(2000) 698 - C5-0108/2001 - 2001/2057(COS)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission report dealing with the activities of the Cohesion Fund in 1999 proves that, as in previous years, it is continuing to pursue the most immediate objectives for which it was created, which are to provide the so-called cohesion countries, Portugal, Spain, Greece and Ireland, with economic infrastructures in the areas of the environment and transport.
In these two areas, for example, the Cohesion Fund has been crucial to the creation of infrastructures that are essential to the development of my region.
Only in 1999, it funded the extension of Madeira' s airport and a major solid waste treatment plant.
We have further grounds to be satisfied with the activity of the Cohesion Fund in 1999.
The physical and the financial execution of the projects that have been supported, the distribution of appropriations between the environment and transport, compliance with Community environmental legislation and the distribution of appropriations by beneficiary countries have all continued to respect the Fund' s operational rules.
Furthermore, no situation involving fraud or duplication of funding between the Cohesion Fund and any other Community fund was uncovered.
Because everything ran to plan in 1999, because this is the last year of the 1993-1999 programming period and because the Commission report provides a broad overview of developments that have taken place during this period, I feel it is more important to focus my speech on the contribution of the Cohesion Fund to achieving economic and social cohesion, of which it is a fundamental instrument.
It should be pointed out, incidentally, that the principle of solidarity, a real pillar of the project of European integration, has seen better days, specifically as a result of the two duplications of financial resources granted to structural policies in 1986 and 1992, whose aim was to enable the cohesion countries to better cope with the pressures unleashed by the huge internal market and by Economic and Monetary Union.
In June 1999, however, when the Heads of State and Government had to decide at the Berlin Summit on the Structural Funds to be allocated for the 2000-2006 period under what came to be known as Agenda 2000, there were no further duplications.
There was even a visible decrease.
It was at that Summit that national self-interest supplanted the European interest of a more cohesive and balanced Europe, which had such tireless champions in Jacques Delors and Helmut Kohl.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, however, the proximity of enlargement and the need to correct the enormous regional imbalances we will see as a consequence make it imperative that we give new impetus to economic and social cohesion policy.
We are convinced that the Commission and, in particular, Commissioner Michel Barnier are equal to this challenge.
We must also consider the fact that giving new impetus to cohesion policy is necessary, not only to deal with the countries that are expected to join the European Union in the near future, but also, even following enlargement, to maintain the fight against the lack of cohesion that still exists in the current European Union of fifteen countries.
As a matter of fact, regional disparities within the current Europe of fifteen could even increase as a result of the pressures produced by the enlargement process, specifically in the relationships between countries on the periphery of the Union and those at its centre.
In other words, countries such as Portugal, for example, may become more peripheral and the current centre, which includes London, Paris and such places, may be increased even further because it will become the centre of a Europe that is economically integrated from the west almost to the eastern border.
We must remember that excessive regional imbalances constitute an economic and political threat to the European Union.
They are an economic threat because, unless we are able to take full and more efficient advantage of the resources of the most depressed regions, the entire European Union will lose out.
They are a political threat because the European Union cannot succeed if it is underpinned by stark territorial and social inequalities.
Europe must have cohesion or it will not work.
Not enabling Europe to work is the great risk that we would run if we went ahead with the totally unacceptable idea of renationalising cohesion policies.
We therefore feel that the creation of the Cohesion Fund by the Treaty of Maastricht has been fully justified.
This is, as a matter of fact, clearly demonstrated by the balance of the first operational period of the Cohesion Fund between 1993 and 1999.
The Cohesion Fund, we can now say, has been a major factor for real convergence, and has provided a strong incentive for the beneficiary countries to comply with the nominal convergence criteria laid down at Maastricht.
We must, therefore, oppose any attempt to abolish the Cohesion Fund.
We must also draw the lessons of this first period of operation to improve the effectiveness of the Cohesion Fund even further.
Mr President, Commissioner, the figures provided by the Commission in its 11th Annual Report on the Structural Funds - confirmed by the Second Report on economic and social cohesion - show that, despite the budgetary effort made in the 1994-1999 period, the considerable social and territorial inequalities that existed prior to 1994 still remain.
The major initial regional differences have remained the same or have increased.
Proof of this is the fact that the average per capita income of the 10% of the population that lives in the most prosperous regions of the Union is still 2.6 times higher than that of the 10% of the population living in the least-developed regions.
Territorial inequalities that existed within certain States that have Objective 1 regions, such as Italy, Spain and Greece are also still very much in evidence.
In contrast with this situation, we have seen a strengthening in recent years of the area between London, Paris and Hamburg. This is a huge central region, which accounts for only a seventh of Europe' s surface area, but for one-third of its population and which enjoys almost one-half of its total income, in a concentration of cities and employment that threatens the sustainable development of the European Union.
Unfortunately, nothing suggests that these trends are likely to change over the next few years.
The budgetary forecasts approved in Agenda 2000 for the present period are extremely restrictive, which means that, whereas in 1999 the percentage of the European Union' s GDP dedicated to cohesion policy reached 0.46%, in 2006 it will not exceed 0.31%, a return to 1994 levels. These figures are extremely worrying.
Furthermore, one need only look at the experience of German reunification to understand that, if we do not do everything that we can to remedy the situation, the problem will get worse when the enlargement States join the Union.
Given these circumstances, we must be aware that when we talk about Structural Funds policy, we are not dealing with 'just another' EU problem.
On the contrary, we are talking about a fundamental issue, in that the direction of political Europe depends to a large extent on positive developments in cohesion policy both with regard to Objective 1 territories in the current EU that still need it and to the new Member States that will require budgetary funds that must not be additional or supplementary funds.
Unless this is precisely the decision we take, we will see the unacceptable paradox of the much-needed cohesion policy for the new States being paid for with money taken from the budget that is today earmarked for the least developed countries of the Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot allow the European Union to take a step backwards in territorial and social development policy.
Political Europe would not be what it is today without cohesion policy and it would be hypocritical and irresponsible to call for the one whilst refusing to provide the economic resources to make the other possible.
In this context, I think that we cannot delay taking a decision that will ensure an increase in the Union' s budget for the next programming period that is considerably higher than 1.27% of the Community GDP.
Mr President, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities sees the European Commission's initiative to mainstream action to support equal opportunities between men and women as an important element in this report.
This initiative has a political and a symbolic side.
It highlights the fact that equality between the sexes is a necessary dimension of our endeavour to achieve economic development with social and regional cohesion.
However, our committee is disappointed that this presentation is regionally based and does not contain accurate data which allow us to assess both women's access to Structural Funds and the impact of Community initiatives on promoting equal opportunities.
Under the new regulation which applies to the 2000-2006 programming period, mainstreaming equal opportunities for women and men is a priority aim and the Member States are obliged to conduct an ex ante evaluation of their programmes from the point of view of gender equality using indicators and statistics.
We should take this opportunity to stress that indicators and statistics need to be broken down by gender, something which the European Parliament has called for repeatedly.
However, we should also stress that we are calling on the European Commission to ensure that the principle of gender equality is duly taken into account and that statistics are kept - not just during programming but throughout the whole monitoring and intervention procedure - on the increase in female employment, the provision of quality, viable new jobs and the creation of infrastructures which allow family and working life to be reconciled.
And, finally, we want to stress the importance of coordinated action between the European Commission and the Member States on informing regional agencies and all entitled beneficiaries of the possibilities of implementing equal opportunities through Structural Fund measures.
.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, 1999 was the last year of the first operating period of the Cohesion Fund, which was created by the Treaty of Maastricht.
It was a fully justified and important instrument, not only of economic and social cohesion, but also of support for the countries which had the greatest difficulties in fulfilling the stability and convergence programmes which lead to the introduction of the single currency.
That fund has been an important factor in terms of real convergence and a strong incentive for compliance with the Maastricht criteria.
Aid has been directed towards the creation of infrastructure, transport and environmental projects.
99% of the aid envisaged was granted, which is rather a shame, since 100% should have been achieved, although that was almost achieved at the end of the period being analysed, that is, in 1999.
The recent reform of the Structural Funds is adequate to significantly simplify the planning, implementation and funding of the interventions and the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has asked for the interventions to involve better assistance for national administrations.
We feel it will be very important in the future to consider a breakdown by gender, which would permit specific actions aimed at the promotion of women.
The financial contribution is lower than that contained in the proposal of the Commission and the European Parliament.
It is regrettable that this will hinder the achievement of the employment objectives, particularly in view of the fact that all the Member States and European institutions are committed to decisive action in favour of employment, agreed at the Lisbon Summit.
It is a positive thing to include amongst the objectives the achievement of equality between men and women in employment programmes, since it is one of the fields in which women clearly participate less than men.
It is therefore satisfactory that the Commission has decided, in accordance with Articles 2 and 141 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, in the future to integrate gender into all Community policies and actions with a view to adopting horizontal positive action measures.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of annual reports is to carry out analyses over a limited period and draw conclusions from them.
This 11th Annual Report on the Structural Funds relates to a year which is undoubtedly very important for the development of the European Union's cohesion policies.
My group supports the rapporteur on some of the proposed measures and options to improve the management of the Structural Funds, such as speeding up the implementation of approved measures, concentrating assistance in areas whose development is lagging behind or improving on-the-spot checks to combat what is still a very high level of fraud.
However, we also have some criticisms. We should point out that we do not endorse some of the conclusions drawn by the rapporteur, such as the overly negative assessment of the Structural Fund results during the planning period and the failure to meet the regional policy objective of harmonising living conditions, which has supposedly only been achieved in part.
I would say to the rapporteur that he has adopted the wrong approach to European structural policy, whose task is solely to reduce disparities and which I believe has generally achieved this goal.
In fact, there will always be a discrepancy between living conditions in the rich and poor regions of the EU, and even within Member States.
We are daydreaming if we expect harmonisation from the structural policies.
We should not confuse achievable goals with a wish list here.
My second point of criticism is that despite all the significance of 1999, the 11th Report is an annual report and not a storehouse catalogue in which all the concerns and problems faced by the European Union in the past, present and future have to be rolled out yet again.
If reports are to achieve anything, they must focus on specific priorities, as we all know from our years of practical experience here in Parliament.
This is precisely what this report does not do.
As I said, the rapporteur's conclusions are not necessarily wrong, but much of what is included in the report really does not need to be there.
That is why we believe that some of the points raised in the report need to be amended by the plenary.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reports we are discussing confirm some of my concerns regarding the execution of the Structural Funds for the 1993-1999 period but, alas, also regarding the new programming period which will end in 2006.
The most striking example is the vast sum of resources which were not spent during the 1993-1999 period and must be used before 31 December this year.
I feel that it is right and important to send out a clear warning two months or so before the expiry date.
We need enthusiastic commitment but, instead, there are regions and States who are irresponsibly disregarding the impending danger of wasting these funds.
Then there is the fact that it would be useful - so to speak - to learn from the errors and delays which occurred during the 1993-1999 period and avoid repeating them.
Mr Mastorakis has already quoted some Greek to you and I am going to quote some Latin: errare humanum est, perseverare autem diabolicum.
This is a well-known saying but many appear to have forgotten it.
The statistics for the year 2000, with which Commissioner Barnier is familiar, do nothing to allay our fears.
Despite the increasing endeavours of the Commissioner himself, the innovations contained in the reform of the Structural Funds are being incorporated slowly and laboriously.
Parliament must seize this opportunity too to reaffirm its right and responsibility to act.
Parliament, which is the body directly elected by the citizens, cannot remain silent if a fundamental instrument for the development of the Communities and their cohesion is not being properly implemented.
We must therefore work shoulder to shoulder - Commission, Parliament, Council and regional and local players - to bring about rapid acceleration and to finalise the payments to projects which enhance the competitiveness of regions, particularly those which are most disadvantaged and underdeveloped.
We must make it clear to everybody that the quality and size of the expenditure, the profitability of the various objectives and the results achieved by the different beneficiaries will be the crucial factors for defining the European Union' s future cohesion strategy.
Mr President, the first thing that the annual reports on cohesion policy for 1999 point out is that the results have been very poor.
During the eleven and seven years, respectively, which these Community Funds have been operating, the average per capita income in Spain, Greece and Portugal, which in 1988 stood at 68%, has risen to 79% of the European average in 1999.
In other words, it has increased by an average of one point per year.
At this rate, it would take 21 more years for the whole of the European Union to achieve an equal level.
I have serious doubts about the political will to eliminate the differences and the genuine solidarity of the governments of the Union.
And I say this because, as Mr Nogueira has pointed out, in 1999 the Funds of the cohesion policy for 92-99 represented 0.46% of GDP, while those from Agenda 2000 until 2006 will only represent 0.31%, that is to say, they will be reduced by 15 points.
Furthermore, there are some who do not intend to increase their contributions but nevertheless, through these reduced amounts, expect to show solidarity with the new Eastern States which will be part of the enlarged EU.
Mr President, if we are really committed to equal opportunities, solidarity and a genuine united Europe, we must stop being miserly and we must all give more money, especially the richest amongst us, for the benefit of the poorest.
Mr President, there is absolutely no doubt about the major role that has been played by the Cohesion Fund in the development of trans-European networks and in environmental operations in the four beneficiary States, and it is certainly very important for the convergence of the economies of the European Union.
The results achieved, however, are not the same across the board, and it is worth exploring the reasons for this.
In reality, strangely, there are bureaucratic problems and mechanisms which are still poorly defined, particularly as regards the time frames for the disbursement and use of the funds: this applies to the Cohesion Fund, of which all the appropriations for 1999 were not used, and it applies to the Structural Funds, which did not achieve the 100% expenditure target both because the majority of the resources were committed only just before the end of the programming period and because of the slow rate of disbursement of the appropriations available. These factors make the process much more burdensome for those implementing the programmes.
The delays certainly do not contribute to the overall improvement in socio-economic and employment conditions in the regions concerned.
In this sense, a crucial moment for both funds is the evaluation, not just an ex ante analysis but also, most importantly, an ex post evaluation, which is no use if it is not carried out within the correct time frame, the correct time frame being before the programming of the subsequent operations, which cannot be carried out rationally if the final evaluation of the previous programmes cannot be taken into account.
Moreover, the evaluation is necessary in order to verify that the principle of additionality is being respected according to the clear indications of the Court of Auditors, which should be observed.
Linked to this is the point that it would be beneficial if the Commission were to provide clearer, more comprehensive information of an essentially social and economic rather than accounting nature on the evaluation of projects, highlighting whether the aim of reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions has been achieved; the European Parliament needs to receive this information in due time, not - as has happened this time with regard to the Cohesion Fund - two years late, for that clearly makes it impossible to correct shortcomings and reprogramme operations in useful time.
And this is an operation that is becoming still more necessary in view of the now impending enlargement.
Finally, we must demand a more active role for Parliament in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the operations and the goals pursued.
Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that over the years, the Cohesion Fund has helped to make less developed regions within the Union stronger.
However, it would be a mistake to think that we do not need to question the current level of the Cohesion Fund.
The impending accession of a number of new Member States alone would prompt this.
I welcome the fact that Mr Marques has outlined the goals, means and conditions of the Cohesion Fund.
The fund was set up to help Member States meet the convergence criteria with the EMU in mind.
There is no ambiguity in this respect.
The Structural Funds, on the other hand, are designed to help meet other goals.
The accession requires us to evaluate and revise the structural policy, including that of the Cohesion Fund, but in my opinion, not so many changes are required.
It is important, however, for the fund only to be used for the purpose it was intended.
If that is the case, the existing system has many successful years ahead, even following the accession.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, I would briefly like to point out, in relation to the reports that we are currently debating, and as we have seen previously, that we are holding a great debate with an important future in terms of the construction of Europe and also the construction of an enlarged Europe.
We are dealing with Funds which were established at a particular moment when our objectives involved a policy of economic and social cohesion.
On the one hand, this policy has clearly been successful but, on the other, we also see that differences remain, as the reports demonstrate.
Does this mean that this policy has failed?
I would say rather that it means that the policy is not only successful for the cohesion countries, for the poorest regions which are receiving significant aid, but also for other regions, in the wealthy countries, which do not receive the aid.
In the end there is widespread movement throughout Europe and, by means of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, those regions of the richer countries end up benefiting from the aid, because technologies are being bought, because investments are being made by those countries in which technological progress is being made.
That is perhaps the reason why the differences are being maintained, after the large amounts of aid and the great investments which have been carried out through the Cohesion Fund.
We are now facing the problems relating to enlargement.
Does the Cohesion Fund need to be modified?
Will the poorer regions stop receiving it?
Are the States which have so far been receiving aid going to stop doing so in favour of the new States?
I believe that this is currently the great challenge for the Commissioner and for Parliament.
I believe that the aid must be maintained, that we have to be imaginative and must ensure that the Funds continue to reach all the regions.
Otherwise, the differences will increase.
We must make an effort to ensure that the enlargement countries also become economic motors which will allow this policy of economic and social cohesion to eventually lead to a much more just and free Europe.
We have seen recent examples of the results of poverty and fanaticism.
Mr President, Commissioner, we in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism have already told Mr Nogueira that we do not share his negative view - or at least his excessively critical view - of the application of economic and social cohesion.
I would even go as far as to say that that evaluation should be positive or even better, given how brilliant the results are.
We would like to make some very specific comments in relation to these two reports on the application of the Funds during the years in question.
It is the case that the information is good because, firstly, Parliament' s recommendations are complied with.
The balance between investments in railways and in road infrastructures, in terms of the environment, has moved into line with the parliamentary recommendation.
There is no report on fraud in the application of these Funds and another series of statistical criteria are correctly complied with.
But we are not the Court of Auditors.
What these reports lack is more of a qualitative character: we want to know what qualitative economic and political effect these investments are having; to what extent is the metabolism of these regions being changed; to what extent are the governments correctly applying the investments, directly towards productive investments, as the structural policy demands.
That is what is lacking in the reports on the application of the Cohesion Fund.
And this is true in all respects.
Next year we will have to examine the reports on the application of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund in 2000 and 2001.
The data will not be good, but I do not want to condemn it in advance because, if the Commission demonstrates that they have been well used in terms of programming, this will be a qualitative element which Parliament will have to take into account.
Mr President, Commissioner, this 11th Annual Report on the Structural Funds may be the last one on the 1994-1999 programme, but it has many lessons to teach us.
First of all, we agree with what the rapporteur, Mr Nogueira Román, says about the lack of a complete quantitative description or detailed explanations of these funds.
Europe must have a genuine return on the funding it grants in order, on the one hand, to monitor that the projects are effectively carried out and that public monies are being put to good use and, on the other hand, to optimise the new programmes.
Furthermore, the citizens of my region keep making the same criticisms: too complicated, too much red tape, too slow.
I think we do not give enough precedence to the small structural projects where simplicity and speed are of the essence if we want to respond to real needs on the ground.
I cannot help wondering about the contradiction between saying we want to give priority to employment, with reference in particular to the Lisbon European Council declarations, while at the same time paying so little attention to the small micro-enterprise and SME projects which, after all and as everyone knows, are the prime job creators.
It is vital that all of us, beginning with the Commission, try to work more closely with all our fellow-citizens.
In conclusion, I want to protest about a practice that I personally find unfair and unfounded.
What I mean is that the Commission could use a form of blackmail - and I am weighing my words here - by tying the funding to strict respect for the environmental obligations it lays down.
I entirely agree about the growing need to respect our environment, but I am equally against this kind of pseudo-ecological diktat.
I think that would be a real diversion of these funds which, let me remind you, are supposed to help finance job-creation and wealth-creation projects to combat the economic imbalances between the various European regions.
Since I know that economic cohesion remains unsatisfactory, let me end by asking what is really behind the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund policy: are these funds designed to be a means of applying pressure or are they designed to provide genuine economic assistance?
It is a question worth asking.
Mr President, I thank both Mr Marques and Mr Nogueira Román for their fine reports, as I thank all the speakers for their comments.
With regard to Mr Marques' report, relating to 1999, it did indeed arrive rather late, in January 2001.
I can tell the rapporteur that this was due to the problems of reorganising our Directorate-General.
Let me now assure him that the report for the year 2000 has been finalised and that the Commission will most probably adopt it in early October.
Briefly, there are four lessons to be learned.
The first concerns total and complete financial implementation throughout the programming period.
It is true that not all the payment appropriations for 1999 were used in full; only 91.6% of available payment appropriations were implemented.
The reason why the appropriations were not all used is the large number of applications for payments reaching the Commission in December 1999.
But, on a more positive note, not a single case of fraud or double financing between the Cohesion Fund and any other Community source was detected in 1999.
I have kept Parliament informed at regular intervals of the progress in implementing the budget and will continue to do so.
Secondly, there is the question of balancing investment in transport and investment in the environment, which, like you, I consider important.
Thirdly, I understand and endorse your wish to see the Commission devote more resources to on-the-spot checks.
Here again, the reorganisation of our departments and in particular the decentralisation of those activities has caused some problems.
Our Directorate-General is now responsible for carrying out on-the-spot checks of Cohesion Fund measures but also of all the actions cofinanced under the Structural Funds.
Fourthly, Mr Marques, coordination between the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds has been given real impetus with the new regulations for the period 2000-2006 and, within the Directorate-General, with the integrated management of the various departments concerned with the Cohesion Fund and the other Structural Funds.
That is what I wanted to say, very briefly - following the President's advice - in response to the four points made in Mr Marques' report, for which I thank him.
Turning now to the report by Mr Nogueira Román, while thanking him too for his fine report, I would again like to make four comments.
Firstly, regarding the implementation of the funds in 1999, 99% of appropriations for the period 1994-1999 were committed and 75% were paid.
That is a figure that, I believe, is broadly satisfactory.
As you know, on-site payments can be made up to 31 December this year, in accordance with the regulations.
The payment appropriations will, I think, be implemented in full and for the last two years - this was a job that began before my arrival - I have been working with the Member States to ensure that they are taken up as fully as possible.
That is a concern that Mr Pittella also raised a moment ago.
The delays in the start-up of some programmes in 1994 and 1995 have, therefore, been overcome for most of the actions under the on-going programme.
A similar improvement in the rate of execution can be seen in the programme of Community initiatives, although here the delays were a little more serious.
It is true, as the rapporteur rightly pointed out, that many outstanding commitments still remained to be paid at the end of 1999.
Basically that was because of the accumulation of projects at the end of the programming period.
But let me point out that the situation quite clearly improved in 2000, since the commitments remaining to be paid at the end of 1999 were reduced by 47%.
In order to keep Parliament more fully informed on the subject, at the end of June 2001 the Commission drew up a full report on the unexpected commitments remaining to be paid for all categories of expenditure.
Secondly, the rapporteur welcomed the fact that the horizontal theme of 1999 was equality between women and men in the Structural Funds programmes.
With regard to the Structural Funds for the current period, I can confirm that gender equality has been one of the criteria for accepting plans received from Member States and you can count on Anna Diamantopoulou being very vigilant on this subject; the same applies to Mr Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou and Mrs Avilés Perea, as I noted a moment ago.
For the period 1994-1999, however, Member States did not have to provide information on the access of women to the Structural Funds.
That means that we have no detailed information on these matters for that programming period.
Thirdly, there is additionality, which the rapporteur sees as open to question, as I do at times.
On this point I can confirm that the Commission has carefully checked for compliance with this principle during the ex-ante review of new programmes for the period 2000-2006.
Regarding the previous period, the Commission will conclude its final check on additionality at the end of 2002.
I agree about the need for more stringent penalties in the event that a Member State does not respect the principle of additionality.
As honourable Members will know, no provision is made for such penalties under the fund rules for the period 2000-2006.
The legislator, chiefly the Council, was firmly opposed to the idea at the time the regulations were adopted.
We do, however, have some measures we can take in the event that additionality has not been verified and if necessary I shall take these measures in consultation with my colleagues.
On the subject of evaluation and monitoring, as you know the mid-term ex-ante or ex-post review was fully integrated into the programming for this new 2000-2006 period.
The Commission has just launched the ex-post evaluation for Objectives 1 and 2 for the 1994-1999 period, together with thematic evaluations of the information society, sustainable development and small and medium-sized enterprises.
These evaluations, like the mid-term reviews that will be carried out in 2003, will provide answers to any outstanding questions and I will, of course, inform the European Parliament of the results.
Fourthly, with regard to monitoring, the same vigilance will apply; but here the Commission now has a different role to play.
As you know, on-the-spot checks now fall within the remit of each Member State, which is obliged to report back to the Commission at regular intervals.
We for our part will and do verify that each Member State has set up a reliable system of on-the-spot checks.
Lastly, let me emphasise that the number of these checks also rose in 1999, reaching the figure of 120 compared with 100 in 1998.
In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me repeat that the Commission is committed to the basic principles of the Structural Funds: concentration, additionality and partnership, and the best possible coordination with the Cohesion Fund.
In their reports, the rapporteurs urge us to be even more effective and vigilant.
Let me assure you that I am confident that we will be able to give you even greater satisfaction when we come to study the results and the evaluation for the year 2000.
That is the year when the new programming will start, together with some new rules.
I believe we will be able to present more positive results, in response to your demands and to the vigilance that you are showing.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Female genital mutilation
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0285/2001) by Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on female genital mutilation [2001/ 2035(INI)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, 130 million women worldwide have been the victims of genital mutilation.
Every year two million girls are subjected to this horrific practice.
Today the European Parliament must act as a spokesperson with regard to this situation which affects millions of women.
We have tried to work on the basis of consensus with all political groups in producing this report.
We have considered the opinions of experts of both sexes, the governments involved and non-governmental organisations.
Our aim is no less than to convince the communities which practice female genital mutilation of the need to eradicate it.
The custom of partially or totally removing the female sexual organs has it roots in a profoundly unjust notion of the role of women in a society which views them as inferior citizens, controlled by the people who make decisions, who are, in most cases, men.
For us, the defence of these traditions has a very clear limit.
The limit is the defence of human rights.
It is not possible, on behalf of any tradition, to accept that women should be seriously and irreversibly mutilated for the rest of their lives.
Information, education and increased awareness are, therefore, essential factors in relation to the disastrous consequences for women' s lives, even though most of them are not even aware of what these may be.
The truth of the matter is that they are going to suffer an irreversible amputation, but they do not even realise the real consequences of such an act.
We have produced a report which asks the Commission, the Council and the Member States to create an integral strategy, which does not only involve penalties, but which deals with the areas affected by this issue: public health, judicial, legal, political, etc. We view female genital mutilation as a serious attack on human rights, and on the basis of this view we request something which is a logical consequence of it: that the right to asylum be granted to women who wish to flee from this situation, that we take them in so that they may escape from something which will be irreversible for the rest of their lives.
According to the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, persecution on the basis of sex must be cause for the granting of asylum rights.
No other persecution on the basis of sex is clearer than this one.
People can abandon their political ideas.
People can abandon their religious beliefs.
But it is impossible to abandon the sex you were born with.
Therefore, since we are dealing with a brutal violation of fundamental rights, it is also fundamental that we offer these individuals the opportunity of refugee status.
I believe that the directive currently being presented by the Commission, on the rules relating to the conditions to be fulfilled by residents of third countries requesting refugee status, moves in this direction, and it will be very important.
For us, this is a question of principle and we cannot abandon this demand.
The report also calls for the promotion of external aid to those African countries which have adopted legislative and administrative measures that prohibit and penalise this practice.
We also urge the European Commission to work closely with non-governmental organisations that make an enormous effort on the ground, very often with scant resources.
We also ask for recourse to the human rights clause in order to make combating genital mutilation a priority action in terms of relations with third countries, in particular with the countries which have close relations with the European Union within the framework of the Cotonou agreement.
Ladies and gentlemen, many women, thousands of African women, are waiting to hear what we have to say in this regard.
It is not solely a problem for African women.
It is a problem for all of us, women and men, because it is a problem of fundamental human rights.
These people are waiting and we must offer them an urgent response.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have a small correction to make: I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation and not the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I am particularly glad I was appointed draftsman of the opinion on this crucial question, which affects so many women in developing countries aside from those in the Fifteen.
I am glad because the Commission adopted my opinion unanimously.
People often look askance at unanimous decisions, suspecting a degree of inattention.
However, I think the Commission and the members of the Committee on Development and Cooperation voted advisedly in this case and were convinced by the various paragraphs that make up the opinion.
I would like to draw Members' attention to two other points, aside from the unanimous vote, given that this unanimity is rather inconsistent with the debate that is still on-going in some political groups.
The first is the right of asylum.
We supported Mrs Valenciano's suggestion to the Council, the Commission and the Member States in her report that the clauses on right of asylum should indeed include one recognising the immediate right of asylum in the Fifteen of women and girls at risk of being subjected to female genital mutilation.
That is most important. Here the vote was unanimous.
I therefore hope that a large section of Parliament will also vote for this paragraph tomorrow.
My second point, Mr President, concerns money. We asked for EUR 10 million to finance all the measures aimed at helping these countries escape from this trap.
I hope that Parliament will vote for it tomorrow and that the Committee on Budgets will follow suit, something the Committee on Development and Cooperation has not done so far.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco for her work, which followed on a resolution supported by 316 Members.
This may be part of the reason why the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report unanimously.
The most important element, which Mr Dell' Alba and Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco referred to, recognising the right of asylum of women under threat from genital mutilation, is considered by our committee too to be one of the major, crucial points in this battle.
I would like to mention once again the two figures which have already been cited: there are 130 million victims in the world; 2 million children undergo genital mutilation every year.
In addition to the various education and information, humanitarian, social and health initiatives and initiatives supporting non-governmental organisations, in particular, our committee feels that it must single out one in particular: the appeal to the Member States to ensure that female genital mutilation is prosecuted through the rigorous application of existing provisions laying down the right to health and personal integrity as a fundamental right, and the rigorous application of the provisions of the penal code which ban any deliberate action violating this right.
We demand, that is, for there to be no possible recourse to the concept of exception or cultural diversity to justify relativism or the watering down of this fundamental right or of the related legal protection which is incumbent upon the State.
We therefore call upon the Commission, the Council and the Member States to endeavour to make our resolutions reality with all speed.
Thank you very much, Mr Turco.
We shall now suspend the sitting until 9.00 p.m. when we shall continue the debate.
I hope that you will gather your strength sufficiently to be back here at 9 on the dot.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
(The sitting was suspended at 8.00 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with an own-initiative report by the Committee on Women' s Rights which examines a serious problem, the genital mutilation of a great number of women and girls.
This ancient practice violates the fundamental rights of the women and girls who fall victim to it and therefore constitutes an attack on the fundamental human rights recognised in the Treaties and in the Declarations of the United Nations.
The report proposes the extension of protection and prevention in all the countries where it is practised and also in the European Union, where we know it is still practised within immigrant communities, or by means of a visit to the country of origin where the genital mutilation is carried out, since this practice is well-established within the customs of many people in Africa and some in Asia.
Only prevention by means of information campaigns and clear explanation of the irreversible consequences of this practice will help to eradicate it.
These campaigns must be carried out by NGOs, but with the firm commitment of governments and the decisive support of leaders, religious leaders in particular; education campaigns in schools, directed at boys and girls, such as those being carried out with considerable success in Burkina Faso, as Mrs Campaore has told us today.
The prosecution of genital mutilation as a crime, both in the country where it is practised and when it is carried out in another country, that is, the extraterritoriality of the crime, will effectively help to eradicate it.
In serious cases, some countries envisage the right to asylum, as contemplated in the directive under the heading of the right to asylum for reasons of sexual discrimination.
We believe that to include here, in a general way, the right to asylum for alleged victims, that is to say, for millions of girls and teenagers, is inappropriate.
We cannot open doors we are then unable to close, and we in the European Union cannot receive all the alleged victims who want to leave their country for this reason.
The reality is that we cannot do it even if we would like to.
It is on this issue that the Group of the European Peoples' Party differs with this report, which may mean, in the event that it is approved, that we will abstain in the final vote.
This is regrettable, because the report has many positive elements, particularly the need for the commitment to include the fight against genital mutilations in all cooperation programmes and to provide them with adequate financial aid, and the demand that the governments of the states where they are practiced commit themselves effectively to their eradication.
We in the Group of the European Peoples' Party unreservedly condemn genital mutilation and we defend the full physical rights of all women, their full sexual rights and their right to decide on their future even though that decision may be at odds with their people' s traditional past.
We defend the rights of women as human beings, fully safeguarding their lives where ever they may be, and we are committed to continuing the work to eradicate this horrendous practice regardless of what may happen in relation to this report.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and a few gentlemen, I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur Ms Valenciano for her outstanding report, which sends out a very clear message: genital mutilation is a human rights violation!
Various reasons are given to justify this human rights violation in the name of traditional culture or religion.
In reality, this is an instrument which is intended to perpetuate women's oppression.
Women who do not want to practise genital mutilation are excluded from society; as outcasts, they face unimaginable poverty and disgrace.
This grave assault on women, which irreparably damages their bodies, minds and health, has gone largely unnoticed.
It was only the Fourth UN World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 which initiated a global debate and solidarity process and called for the international community to take joint action.
We also encounter genitally mutilated women in Europe, as well as many different perpetrators and accomplices.
Although FGM is punishable in many countries, the media and self-help organisations report that there are an estimated 5000 cases in Germany alone, and around four times as many cases involving girls being sent back to their countries of origin to be mutilated.
There are unscrupulous doctors and other individuals who earn between DM 1000 and 3000 per case.
The Socialist Group demands that at-risk women be granted asylum, perpetrators be punished, and that we proceed in accordance with the principle of extraterritoriality.
Let me make this very clear: for my group, this is an important point, and we completely fail to understand why some sections of the PPE-DE - or indeed, the group as a whole - intend to abstain on this asylum issue, have no intention of voting for the report, and are thus abandoning women to their fate.
The fight against ignorance and oppression must be fought at international level, and the Socialist International has therefore launched a worldwide campaign against violence against women.
Fifteen states have already banned FGM, including nine African countries.
More support must be given.
My government in Germany has already allocated DM 3.8 million for education work and projects.
The EU is helping with DAPHNE.
Yet this is just a drop in the ocean.
We must work together to fight for reproductive health and combat AIDS and genital mutilation.
Then we will have a chance of reaching women and giving them the help they need.
Mr President, I would first of all like to express my appreciation to Mrs Valenciano, who, in her excellent report, has tackled this sensitive issue in a clear and compelling manner.
The Liberal Group will therefore support the report.
The genital mutilation of women and girls is a terrible violation of fundamental human rights.
More than 130 million women have already fallen victim to this, and another two million are added every year.
Europe should therefore pull out all the stops to combat this phenomenon, wherever it appears.
I too understand that some Members are considering voting against this report on account of the sections on asylum and extraterritoriality.
However, I would like to reassure everyone: if we consider the present asylum practice, we see that in most of the fifteen Member States, genital mutilation is already a basis for asylum.
I believe that to be appropriate.
From that point of view, the report merely accommodates existing practices.
It is true that at present, the principle of extraterritoriality only applies to child-sex tourism, but it should also cover mutilated women or women who are at risk.
For this is the only way to prevent EU citizens, for example from Somalian extraction, from taking their daughters to Somalia during the summer holidays to have them mutilated.
If these people realise that upon their return to Europe, they are at risk of being prosecuted, we then give the parents a weapon with which to protect their daughters against the pressure of society.
Finally, I would like to direct a comment to those who do not want to deal with genital mutilation due to it constituting an expression of a certain culture or religion.
In all countries where genital mutilation is practised, local groups are running campaigns to abolish it.
It is therefore not a case of us imposing our Western standards.
No, it is precisely these women whom we need to support by showing our solidarity tomorrow during the vote.
The Koran too leaves no room for mutilation.
Despite this, it is mainly in Islamic countries that it is practised.
We must therefore call on the Imams to help eradicate this phenomenon.
This is crucial, since we cannot afford negative stereotyping of Islamic beliefs in the current sensitive climate.
Genital mutilation is not a religious phenomenon, it is a violation of a fundamental human right.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my entire group, I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Valenciano on this sterling report and the recommendations it contains, to which I subscribe 200%.
By far the majority of women who have undergone genital mutilation - reference is made to 130 million - live in Africa.
In at least 28 African countries located between the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer, female circumcision is practised systematically.
Outside Africa, it is practised in southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, on the Arab peninsula in Yemen, in Oman and in the United Arab Emirates.
Even in a country like Egypt, few tourists who visit the sphinx realise that 90% of the women are circumcised.
However, some of these women have fled to Europe in order to save their daughters from this treatment, or to have operations in order to ease the pains.
But if these women were to return to their native country, they would be ostracized.
On the other hand, a summer holiday in the country of origin can turn into a nightmare for migrant girls, when family members deem it necessary to uphold their tradition.
I have devoted years of my life to helping women who had fallen victim to the trafficking in human beings.
From my own experience, I know that circumcised women are often considered unclean and are therefore sold as prostitutes. In this way, they become victims twice over.
African girls, who work in brothels day in day out, who, genitally mutilated, are sold and re-sold, rely on their clients to pay off their debts.
I therefore urge the Member States and the Commission once again to recognise genital mutilation, or the threat thereof, as a gender-specific reason for granting asylum.
We should not hide behind a possible review of the Convention of Vienna.
I would ask those in this House who are still not convinced to watch the videos that are being made of these 'festive occasions' , as they are sometimes referred to in those countries.
It is of fundamental importance that the silence around this taboo subject is broken.
That is why socio-cultural programmes in situ, as well as awareness campaigns involving the relevant migrants in Europe must be encouraged.
We cannot continue to accept this flagrant violation of human rights and of the dignity of the women and girls involved, under the guise of national customs and traditions.
I would like to take the opportunity of saying that, in view of the excellent quality of the next report by Mrs Smet, our group will not be taking the floor: that report equals perfection.
By way of conclusion, I would like to congratulate Mrs Valenciano once again on the work she has done.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the importance and originality of this courageous report, in comparison with the countless reports and documents adopted by many international bodies, is that, unambiguously and without making any hypocritical concessions, it views the question of female genital mutilation as an issue of freedom, dignity, law and human rights for hundreds, thousands of women in the world.
I hope that Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco has the support of all of us here. She does not make any hypocritical concessions to supposed respect for traditions or cultural relevatism, which we hear talked about so often, nor does she make any concessions even to the cheap efforts to salve our consciences which so often characterise the positions we adopt.
Indeed, while emphasising in the report that female genital mutilation is a crime, which must therefore be prosecuted, she proposes a raft of pro-active measures which it will also be our responsibility and the responsibility of the other institutions - Commission and Council - to implement.
I would, however, like to make one point to Mrs Avilés Perea, for whom I have great admiration.
You presented to us a situation which does not exist, saying that it would be inappropriate to establish the threat of female genital mutilation as grounds for the right of asylum because that would be to open our doors to millions of women seeking protection.
You see, Mrs Avilés Perea, if there were millions of women and children who were able to revolt, to come out into the open and flee family, social and male control, then the problem would already be resolved.
Therefore, the situation must be different: sadly, there are not hundreds of thousands or millions of children and women who currently have the chance to revolt, to come out into the open, to go and knock on the door of an embassy to seek asylum.
We are in a situation in which there are very few indeed who have the courage to do this, and to think about closing the door even on these few - and I beg you once again to consider this - is not responsible.
We would not be doing our duty. We would be back in a situation of preaching empty sermons, of cheap efforts to assuage our consciences, of failing to assume responsibilities that our ours, that are the responsibilities of this free, civil, democratic Europe which upholds the rights of all.
This, I believe, is what we are trying to say in our report tomorrow: we want to say that we are for a world in which human beings are all equal.
I am convinced that, if such a brutal form of mutilation as this had been forced upon our male fellow Members, the issue would have been resolved long ago.
The problem is that this is not yet the way in which the world works and it is our responsibility, the responsibility of this institution, to set an example.
Lastly - and I am addressing the Members who are also part of the Committee on Development and Cooperation - today, I have a meeting with the Secretary General of the ACP Secretariat, Ambassador Goulongana, who has declared himself willing to include this matter in the forthcoming meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Brussels at the end of October.
I know that the agendas are fixed and that it may be too late to make changes, but there must also be an element of political interest in all this that will ensure that some flexibility preserved in this rigid climate!
There must be a difference which we can use to our advantage!
I hope that the ACP-EU Joint Assembly will approve our position as well as this House.
Ladies, I would remind all of you who are hesitating that there are very few women - very few indeed - who have the chance, the courage and indeed the good fortune to be able to revolt.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am very pleased that this report has been presented.
Every one of us who has read 'Desert Flower' by Waris Dirie will always be shocked and appalled by this practice.
I am thinking today of the 130 million women and girls who have been subjected to female genital mutilation, and each year some two million more are affected.
I am also thinking of the many young girls who die horrifically as a result.
Let me say from the outset that I am strongly in favour of the EU and its Member States adopting a joint position to abolish these practices which are harmful to women's sexual and reproductive health.
Within the framework of a joint immigration and asylum policy, the Commission and the Council will have to take account of these aspects of female genital mutilation.
The same applies to refugee policy.
In this context, let me point out - and this is clear, in my view - that asylum will then be granted primarily when political protection is required for reasons of state.
Genital mutilation is a grey area, and it is usually carried out by private individuals.
This makes it even more difficult to combat the practice.
A great deal of persuasion, public information and educational work is required from all of us and a change of attitude is needed in society as a whole.
For me, genital mutilation is a human rights violation which I cannot accept under any circumstances or from anyone.
A public debate on this issue is needed to raise awareness both in the EU and in the developing countries and spare future generations of women this dreadful mutilation.
Above all, we must ensure - and this has been mentioned by previous speakers - that this practice is also outlawed in the Member States, for I know that there is a major grey area here.
I ask everyone to work together with a genuine will to stop this practice.
Mr President, two weeks ago a Swedish TV documentary attracted a great deal of attention when it showed how religious leaders, Christian and Muslim, in Sweden recommend Sunna circumcision, how Swedish citizens have their daughters circumcised in Kenya and Somalia during the summer holidays, how circumcisers are flown into Sweden to conduct circumcisions and how a Swedish doctor failed to report to the social services the fact that he had saved a girl from bleeding to death after her parents had had her circumcised.
For those of us combating female genital mutilation, it is precisely the support of the holy men for this torture which is most disheartening.
Religious leaders have a particular responsibility. Their influence is enormous and their voices crucial to putting an end to circumcision.
I welcome the excellent report from Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco with its demands for a holistic strategy for eliminating female genital mutilation within the EU through initiatives such as extensive publicity campaigns and laws against female genital mutilation in all Member States.
Of particular importance is the requirement for the introduction of specific national laws which also apply to circumcisions beyond national borders and which make it possible to punish citizens when they return home after travelling abroad to have their daughters circumcised.
In 1999, Sweden became the first and only country in the EU to have this type of extra-territorial legislation, which hopefully will now make it possible to bring to book those Swedes who put their daughters through 'summer holiday circumcision' abroad.
Another key point in the report, which many have already mentioned, is the requirement that escape from this torture should be taken at least as seriously as escape from political persecution.
The US and Canada have, on several occasions, already stopped the deportation of girls and young women who have sought asylum for fear of being circumcised.
Europe should not lag behind in this respect.
It is high time that we took strong measures to save the two million girls around the world who, each year, are at risk of genital mutilation.
We place our hope and our confidence in the Commissioner' s returning with practical proposals on which our ministers can then adopt a position.
Mr President, female genital mutilation is a terrible act of extreme violation which causes serious physical and mental damage and a lifetime of suffering.
The mortality rate among those who are subjected to this practice is high.
There is a need for really vigorous efforts to combat this abomination, this terrible act, wherever it occurs.
This is also a European problem, and it is important to ensure that knowledge, research and documentation on female genital mutilation is improved in Europe.
We need cooperation in order to find common strategies to ensure that this operation, which is not prescribed by any religion, can be abolished.
Several Members have highlighted the need to cooperate with religious leaders.
Those women already circumcised need care and rehabilitation, and we must therefore put our faith in more knowledgeable midwives, social workers and teachers.
Mrs Theorin referred to what we in Sweden call summer holiday circumcision, which is when girls are taken abroad to be circumcised.
In my country this is forbidden, and so it is only natural for the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to support the proposals to introduce this ban everywhere.
This would provide a clear signal that female genital mutilation is illegal at home and illegal abroad and that such mutilation constitutes a violation of human rights.
Mr President, the use of genital mutilation is an extreme form of female repression which, in some countries, is as old as time itself.
It was the women of those countries themselves, of Egypt and of Somalia, who told us about their extreme suffering.
They denounced it and had to overcome a world of prejudice in the process, but they did it for the benefit of their sisters, who were often younger, or their daughters.
They are asking us to show the same courage.
A number of women have sent the European Parliament a petition in the same vein.
We are supported by women across the world.
Respect for the human being must be judged the same for men and women alike: women' s rights are human rights.
Allowing this mutilation to take place under medically acceptable conditions does not make the mutilation itself acceptable.
Neither is the fact that this cruel custom is one of the oldest traditions in some communities - I am deliberately avoiding the term 'religions' , for they have little to do with it - reason for us to tolerate it.
The sexual mutilation of girls must be considered a punishable offence in every country and every society, as demanded in various international agreements.
A positive development is that, in any event, an increasing number of countries have prohibited genital mutilation in women.
But in many cases, they are merely paying lip service to this ban, and we should therefore amend the Cotonou Agreement so that we can implement it in the same way as for human rights violations.
For the rest, I share the view of fellow MEPs.
Mr President, Valenciano Martínez-Orozco' s excellent report clearly states that female genital mutilation is a crime, about which Europe must not remain silent.
I too appeal to all Members of Parliament to show their unanimous support for the report in tomorrow' s vote.
Female genital mutilation, of whatever degree, is an act of violence against women, which violates their fundamental rights, their individual integrity, and their physical and mental health.
The rights of women, young girls or baby girls are being trampled on in the name of various cultural traditions or even the assumed dictates of religion.
Ever present in the background, however, is women' s social status and position, which is inferior to that of men in these cultures.
There is therefore also a need to promote equality.
Regrettably, female genital mutilation has been found to have taken place and to be taking place in immigrant communities in the EU also, although this practice is prohibited in the criminal legislation of Member States and it is clearly in breach of the principles of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.
No religious or cultural practice can be allowed to take precedence over the basic principles of human rights or someone' s physical and mental integrity, on which European democracy is based.
We must also vehemently resist the demand that genital mutilation should be carried out by doctors in clinical conditions.
This must not be compared to male circumcision, where this practice has been adopted in some Member States.
I support the report' s positive measures that aim to end these crimes in EU Member States.
Information, awareness-raising and prevention must be the priorities.
But we also have to take action where the crime of mutilation has already occurred, with penal measures and sanctions.
Personally, I am also prepared to adopt the principle of extraterritoriality in this connection.
I urge authorities in the Member States, and, as a Finnish member, obviously those in my native country of Finland in particular, to implement all necessary measures as soon as possible to bring to an end these inhuman violations of human rights, which are something out of the Middle Ages.
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco on her excellent and comprehensive report.
It is a fact that, for millions of women throughout the world, genital mutilation is an unavoidable, terrifying ordeal which they have to go through if they are to survive.
The absence of any alternative and a complete lack of information are one of the most serious problems for women who suffer this degrading mutilation, which is one of the worse forms of suppression, terrorism and exploitation of women, a criminal practice which violates their personal freedom, their physical integrity, their freedom of conscience and their right to health by causing serious physical injury and mental side effects, not to mention the impact on their sexual identity and ability to bear children.
One hundred and thirty million mutilated women in the world is a terrifying number.
Unfortunately, this horrible practice has also been introduced into the European Union.
According to a statement by the British Medical Association, three thousand women are mutilated in the United Kingdom every year and naturally the fundamentalists, even within the European Union, have no hesitation in applying mediaeval practices in order to subjugate women and control their sexuality.
Every human being is entitled to protection under the law when fundamental freedoms and rights are at risk, as is the case with mutilation.
However, European Union law seriously lacks any teeth, which is why we are calling for legislation to be applied which will make this horrible practice a crime.
And, of course, the European Union can exert a great deal of influence through the trade agreements under the Cotonou agreement which it concludes with countries in which such practices are rife and by introducing extraterritorial legislation.
Finally, I should like to call on the PPE-DE, for us to unite in demonstrating our solidarity with the thousands of women who have undergone this horrible procedure and for you to change your decision by tomorrow.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, female genital mutilation inflicts endless pain and suffering on women and girls in at least 25 African countries, most of them ACP countries.
Women are the victims of violent and life-threatening cultural traditions which must be ended, for a tradition which violates individual rights - in this case women's rights - in a truly horrific way must not be allowed to continue in the twenty-first century.
Thankfully, the ACP countries in Africa are increasingly recognising this fact.
It is gratifying that Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Uganda, Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic and the Côte d' Ivoire have legislated against female genital mutilation.
Efforts are also being made - with the support of aid organisations and numerous NGOs - to stop this dreadful practice through public information campaigns and awareness-raising.
In this context, a resolution adopted by the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly at its last meeting in Libreville (Gabon), Ms Bonino, should be emphasised in positive terms.
Supported by the representatives of the ACP countries, the resolution called unanimously on the authorities to take the necessary steps to end this practice, adopting all appropriate legislative, administrative and judicial measures and launching cultural awareness and information campaigns.
The meeting thus branded the practice as a human rights violation. This is a great improvement on the earlier taboos surrounding this issue, and we must pay tribute to it.
However, the battle to protect the physical and mental integrity of women in the ACP countries and elsewhere is still not won.
Our solidarity and support are still needed.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco and start by stressing the political importance and impact of this report, which will of course be even greater if it is supported by a large majority.
This report will give momentum both to the Commission's work and, more importantly, to the women's organisations in Europe and Africa trying to combat this barbaric practice.
This is a problem which, as several Members of Parliament have said, does not only exist in Africa.
According to data from the DAPHNE programme, there are about 700,000 women from these countries in Europe today.
It is difficult to quote an actual figure but we suspect that it is much higher than we can possibly imagine.
This is a difficult, thorny problem.
Obviously cultural traditions which go back centuries in certain areas of our planet form part of it.
But a cultural tradition cannot be used as an alibi for trampling all over human rights.
Obviously, as stated at the World Conference in Beijing, genital mutilation is a violation of human rights and, at a secondary level, it is discrimination, because it only applies to women and girls.
What can the European Union do?
First, proposals and legislation. There is some disagreement as to whether the present Treaty provides a legal basis for European legislation.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights adopted in Nice cannot as yet form a legal basis.
However, legislation is not always the only solution and there is a great deal which can be done in this area.
The question of asylum. Several speakers raised this argument and the report is clear here.
May I say that, a few days ago, the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive to the Council on the adoption of minimum requirements for recognising the status of third country nationals or stateless persons or refugees in accordance with the Geneva Convention. After a great deal of discussion and effort, the text includes a clear reference stating that applications for protection for women will be recognised, especially where there is a probability of sexual violence or some other gender-related conduct.
I think, therefore, that it is worth examining this Commission proposal, which could provide a basis for an agreement which would be very important to all the groups in the European Parliament.
However, over and above the legislative framework, current European Union programmes can be used as a basis for supporting action and campaigns to recognise the problem, mobilise society and increase public awareness and, of course, to inform and educate hospital staff.
Medical and health workers in at least five countries in the European Union often come into contact with such cases and they must be specially trained and specially qualified to help these people.
The potential for educating and supporting immigrants.
Clearly, women need financial resources if they are to be financially independent and organise their own rebellion, and support for female immigrants in Europe is therefore paramount.
We can support them and integrate them into the labour market and fund information and public awareness campaigns through existing programmes which we have already debated in Parliament and we are waiting for proposals from non-governmental organisations on these issues.
As far as our relations with the third world are concerned, we have already made a serious effort to ensure that development aid is predicated on respect for human rights by governments, especially in this area, and to take account of governments' efforts to apply policies to educate, train, raise awareness and support women and families.
We already intend, in collaboration with the development sector and the Commissioner responsible, to increase financial support to countries intent on wiping out this practice.
I think we can draw satisfactory conclusions from the implementation of this programme in Ethiopia as to what we can achieve if the European Union works with governments through development aid.
Finally, we appreciate that non-governmental organisations can act as a catalyst both in the European Union and in Africa, which is why they are the Commission's main contacts, our main partners in this endeavour.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Equal pay for work of equal value
The next item is the report (A5-0275/2001) drawn up by Mrs Smet on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities on equal pay for work of equal value.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite all the judicial instruments at European level and in the Member States banning wage discrimination, there are still considerable and persistent wage differences between men and women.
The figures that are available to us from - indeed very interesting - European studies, show that there is a wage gap of 25 to 28% and in some countries as high as 30%.
For example, the wage gap is greater in the private sector than in the public sector, the industrial and agricultural sectors have greater wage differentials than the service sector, and the gap seems to be widest in those sectors where women are underrepresented.
It is not always easy to interpret these statistics correctly.
But it is generally accepted that the different career patterns of men and women account for about half of the wage gap - for example, women interrupt their careers more easily than men, with slower career progress as a result - the lower qualifications especially of older working women, the fact that working women are on average younger than working men - in other words, the objective, structural differences.
The other half of the wage gap, however, cannot be explained objectively and seems to suggest that there are hidden mechanisms of discrimination at play which lead to the undervaluing of female-dominated jobs and professions.
The key mechanism is the job evaluation system, by means of which different jobs are ranked according to importance, and according to that job ranking, are allocated their salary scales.
In most cases, this job evaluation is done by the social partners, whether or not based on a system set up by an advisory office.
Discrimination in job evaluation is evident from the fact that too low a value is placed on characteristics associated with traditionally feminine jobs, including social skills, women' s greater capacity to concentrate and greater dexterity.
As they are awarded lower scores, valued less, these jobs are thus given too low a place in task hierarchies and payrolls, which means that the wage level for women is lower.
At the same time, the characteristics associated with traditionally masculine jobs, for example technical insight, physically demanding work or financial responsibility, are correspondingly over-valued.
In general, workers do not know how their job is classified.
It is even open to question how much insight the social partners have into how jobs are classified within businesses.
Moreover, women are generally not involved in job evaluation since they are not the negotiators with the social partners.
The question then arises as to what Europe can do about this.
Commissioner, I believe that first of all, the gathering of statistical data on wages of men and women, and on wage differentials, must drastically improve.
At present, the gathering of statistical data both at European level and in most Member States leaves something to be desired.
This should therefore be addressed first.
I know that the Commission has appointed a group of experts to set this in motion, but I would also urge them to look for an explanation of the wage differentials.
Secondly, the European Union would do well to delve deeper into the issue of discrimination in job evaluation.
For this purpose, an initiative could be launched, for example to supplement the Directive of 1975 which deals with equal pay, with an annexe in which a number of rules and criteria are laid down which guarantee a gender-neutral evaluation system.
The Member States need a guide.
So do the social partners.
In my opinion, Europe could provide the perfect solution.
Moreover, the social partners must be committed to ensuring transparency concerning the value scales used in the wage formation process.
How can people find out if their wage is or is not the product of discrimination if there is no transparency whatsoever in the way in which their wage is determined?
The social partners should commit in the same way to involving more women in wage negotiations, particularly to removing discrimination and at long last making wage discrimination No 1 on their agenda, for that never happens.
In addition, the guidelines for employment must be tightened up with quantitative objectives, target dates and goals in mind.
They are not included, not even in the new guidelines, even though they are much better than the previous ones.
This must be followed much more closely.
I have never heard the Commission complain about the fact that the national action plans devote too little attention to this issue.
In summary, there is a need for a global policy strategy.
All these elements would form part of this and of the campaign which the Commission intends to launch and which could, in fact, be a useful tool in highlighting a number of these matters.
Commissioner, I would therefore urge you to make this item for once a priority for the benefit of women.
Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, I would like to congratulate Mrs Smet on her report and thank the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities for adopting so many of the conclusions produced by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Three things are clear: one, women's wages are on average lower than men's across all occupations; two, women are predominantly employed in areas where the work has traditionally been regarded as of less value; three, women comprise a significantly higher proportion of part-time workers than men.
The problem is therefore, clearly a deeply rooted one and cannot be solved without concerted action by all parties.
This must include the introduction of job evaluation schemes based on objective, gender-neutral criteria, so that the current undervaluing of women's skills is brought to an end.
However, we need also, as Mrs Smet has said, a much wider range of initiatives designed to tackle the structural disadvantages suffered by women on the labour market.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is appreciative of the extent to which the Commission is already addressing the issue through its proposals for the employment guidelines in 2002.
The emphasis on gender mainstreaming and the strengthening of guideline 17 are particularly welcome. We also look forward to the proposals the Commission may have for a revision and updating of the 1975 equal pay directive.
In the meantime, we call on both the Member States and the social partners to involve themselves actively in developing measures of the kind urgently needed to eliminate the gender pay gap.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Mrs Smet on this own-initiative report, which was so necessary and which she has produced in a very professional way, because she has a profound knowledge of the problem and has done a lot of work on it.
But despite the fact that it is a very good report which attempts to study each of the points relating to inequality of pay between men and women, today we are facing a deep-seated problem to which we see no solution.
It is more difficult for women to find work than it is for men, they have more difficulties in terms of training and professional promotion and they have lower salaries than men.
But this does not only affect women who have been in the labour market for some time, but it also affects young women who are very well prepared, in many cases better prepared than men, who do brilliant work and who receive lower salaries than their male colleagues.
There is no justification for it whatsoever, there is no legislation which allows it in any of the countries of the European Union but, despite all this, it is a reality which we are facing and which we have no idea how to solve.
Social partners, both company organisations and unions, probably have a large role to play in resolving this problem.
I am sure that, if there were more women in the leadership of these organisations, the issue would probably have been dealt with a long time ago.
It is very regrettable that, while we are combating many other types of discrimination which are sometimes difficult to demonstrate, we have still not been able to resolve this one which is so obvious, which is reflected in the figures which appear on everybody' s payslips every month.
I believe that the fact that women' s work is undervalued, that their work has always been considered subordinate to men' s work, that it has always been thought that they are not capable of holding top positions, are prejudices which are still present in society' s mentality, which hinder equality, professional access and greater promotion for women.
I would ask the Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, to seek some initiative which will contribute to resolving this problem.
If in a Member State of the European Union somebody suffering discrimination presents a case and wins it, if they work in the public sector, their greatest problem will be confronting the dirty looks of their colleagues, but if they work in the private sector, sooner or later it will lead to them leaving their job.
This means that many women do not even use the legal resources available to them.
Mr President, this is a very important issue because this is discrimination which faces all women, not only in the EU, but across the world.
We therefore welcome this report as its findings are indeed serious.
It shows, as the rapporteur said, that there is a 20-25% difference between male and female earnings on average in the European Union and that in some Member States the situation is much worse.
This report is a very practical one, putting forward measures which actually suggest very concrete things which can be done to address this very difficult issue.
So we support the measures set out in the report and call for this action to be taken sooner rather than later, because this is discrimination that women have faced for a very long time.
We have hundreds of years of discrimination to address and we need to get on with doing that.
I certainly support all calls for this to become a priority for the EU and for the Commission.
I would particularly like to draw attention to the fact that there are three Member States mentioned in the report in which the situation is significantly worse, worse enough for them to be singled out in the report.
Those Member States therefore have a special responsibility to take action and to ensure that they get themselves up to the EU average as quickly as possible.
There are two other things in the report I would like to highlight.
First of all awareness campaigns: these are something that Member States could actually do without too much difficulty.
They will not address the actual issues in the workplace, but it is something which governments can do relatively easily.
The other thing which the report mentions, which I would like to draw attention to, is that governments themselves can provide a model, and I therefore call on Member State governments to look at their own employment policies and identify how they might become better employers themselves.
Mr President, I too should like to thank Mrs Smet for a quite outstanding report.
However, I cannot omit to say that I find it disgraceful that, in the year 2001, we are still discussing these problems, and we know into the bargain that enlargement is not going to make matters any better, to put it mildly.
The conclusion is that not only do women have lower paid jobs but, as a result, they do not get the plum management positions either, their having access to which is one of the prerequisites for our being able to change the situation.
If, however, I wanted to take the floor here this evening, it is because I want to draw your attention to a study which has just been published in Denmark and which shows that 'unequal pay' has its origins in childhood.
The study shows that girls receive far less pocket money than boys.
They are given far fewer consumer goods than boys and they earn less than boys, which means that boys begin saving up while they are still children.
Inequality has thus already been established.
This applies to all age groups, except for the 16 to 18 group.
In all other age groups, girls are given less pocket money than boys.
It is parents themselves, indeed women themselves, who give their girls less pocket money than their boys.
It might also be added that boys have much better jobs and so earn more, too.
The situation is the same regarding consumer goods.
It turns out, of course, that boys have more TV sets, more PCs in their rooms etc. Perhaps we should begin with ourselves.
Parents must give some thought to how they treat their children and prevent their being treated unequally from the cradle onwards.
I recommend obtaining this Danish report.
I thought it was very interesting.
I thank Mrs Smet for having taken the initiative to draft this report.
I would like to point to three difficulties but first of all I want to make one thing clear: when we refer to a 25% wage gap, this covers all occupations taken together.
In general the figure is 15% in the case of equal work.
The reason I want to remind you of these two figures and these two concepts is because it is most important to highlight the difficulties we find ourselves in today, as my colleagues have done.
The situation is extremely difficult and the solutions are not very visible or effective.
Let me draw attention to three points.
Firstly, in France, for example, women only occupy 10% of all jobs.
Of every 300 jobs, only 30 are filled by women.
Women therefore have access to 10% of all the jobs on offer.
So there certainly is a need for a change of approach.
Secondly, in this report we refer to atypical work. It is also known as part-time work.
Some countries think it is good for women.
Personally, I do not think so at all.
That is not the way to achieve equal pay and economic equality.
For there cannot be equal pay without economic equality.
Thirdly, we need equal representation in the social partners' decision-making bodies.
I would certainly be the first to fight for parity between men and women in the social partners' decision-making.
But there are many jobs where no social partners exist, that is, all service jobs.
So what can we do there?
We have laid down a law on night work in France, which says that the social partners must address the matter.
But there are no social partners in the case of these jobs, which poses serious problems.
I would just like to ask the Commissioner for one thing in face of all these immense difficulties: that we lay emphasis on the question of equal pay at the second reading of the 1976 directive we are currently revising together with you and with the Council. This issue does not seem to be welcome in the discussions with the Council.
I think it is quite essential if there is to be any point to this revision of the 1976 directive.
If we are once again to talk about equal pay, even if it is a principle that has already been introduced by the Treaty of Rome, it must be time for us to ask ourselves whether other strategies might not be necessary to abolish the wage gap between men and women when the EU' s overall efforts have proved a failure.
I believe that, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, we must in future transfer more of the responsibility to the individual Member States.
It is in individual workplaces that experience is gained.
To be quite specific, it must be up to the individual countries, via the two sides of industry, to incorporate the principle of equal pay into national collective agreements.
We must take account of the fact that there are differences between collective agreements and wage agreement systems in the Member States.
Instead of direct EU legislation in this area, the EU must provide guidelines and recommendations, and the principle must be incorporated, more than it has been so far, into national action plans for employment and non-discrimination.
In the years to come, the labour market will have a need for a larger workforce, and it is therefore important for us to expend more energy on creating better conditions for women.
All in all, I am able to support all the initiatives put forward in the Smet report.
Mr President, efforts to equalise pay for male and female workers for work of equal value have been made at European level since 1951.
In 1957, this was enshrined in the Treaty of Rome as a guiding principle and in 1975 in a directive.
Despite the legal ban on wage discrimination, there is, as has been said on several occasions today, still a wage gap in the EU at the moment.
That is unacceptable.
I appreciate that in some cases, it is difficult to establish an objective wage formation process or job evaluation procedure, but that does not take away from the need for more transparency and gender-neutrality.
The report rightly mentions value discrimination.
That is where the government could step in, but so could the social partners.
As stated before, they too play a significant role.
It is also important to involve women more in wage negotiations and in the decision-making process in general, and to recruit more women in decision-making bodies.
It is embarrassing that the statistics available at European level on male and female wage differentials are out of date and incomplete.
I therefore welcome the initiative to collect new data and I support the idea of carrying out further studies into the factors which affect salary scales, as well as the causes of unequal pay for work of equal value.
A wage difference of 15% remaining after taking into consideration aspects such as age, training and career level is, as already mentioned, not acceptable.
The topic we are discussing at the moment cannot be seen in isolation from other aspects related to women and the participation of women in work.
It is closely related to aspects such as access to work, chances of promotion, a combination of work and care, etc. Equal pay for work of equal value can help break the vicious circle of lifelong inequality: lower pay leads to a smaller pension or to more work in order to obtain the same pension; more work often entails a greater need for child care, less time to develop other talents or abilities or to relax outside work, etc.
I am pleased that the Belgian Presidency prioritises this issue and hope that the Member States will take this appeal seriously this time.
I am also expecting the campaign on this topic in the year 2002 to provide a boost for it.
The report we are discussing is an initiative report.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Smet, on her work.
It is mainly thanks to her commitment that this initiative report is now before us.
It outlines once more a number of aspects very clearly and offers specific directions for solutions.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has played a decisive role in condemning and in attempting to resolve the problem of pay inequalities between men and women that exist in our fifteen countries.
Both the Treaties and now national laws uphold the principle of equal pay for men and women.
No country, however, complies with its own laws in this field.
The differences vary from country to country, but the outcome is the same.
When employment in a given sector is dominated by women, the outcome is lower pay.
It is the jobs mainly held by women that society accepts should be the least well paid.
Even in Scandinavian countries, where women have achieved equality, even in political life, it is proving difficult for them to enter decision-making positions in privately owned companies, where salaries are higher.
We therefore have a situation that is out of kilter, in that the laws impose equality but society continues to accept a model that fails to value work undertaken by women.
In order to ensure that real democracy is practised and that a new social model that accepts equality is created, we need to give men greater rights in the field of their private lives.
The laws that have been adopted and the proposals in this area are quite telling.
In Portugal, for example, the government recently presented Parliament with a proposal for a law making parental leave mandatory for a period of at least five days.
No European country currently has such a law. This type of leave is granted at the employer' s discretion and the aim of this law is to attempt to change people' s way of thinking.
The fact that society continues to accept men' s abdication of duties in their home lives constitutes a genuine form of unfair competition to which women are subjected in their professional lives.
If we want to change the situation of disadvantage that women continue to experience in the workplace, we need to change people's attitudes and the practices of the social partners.
And here, the European Union must continue to play a key role.
At the Lisbon Summit, Europe acknowledged that only by increasing the rate of employment for women will it be able to achieve, within ten years, the economic and social development that it wants to see.
Europe must now acknowledge that it needs not only more working women but also the jobs that women do.
To this end, the Commission proposed and the Council accepted equal pay as one of the priorities for 2001 in its programme for equality.
The European Trade Union Confederation has also decided to make this issue its priority for this year.
In drafting this own-initiative report, the European Parliament...
(The President cut the speaker off)
...
I only wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Smet and say that I agree with her proposals.
Mr President, the report's estimated 28% pay differential between men and women is particularly revolting because in many cases even men are not paid nearly enough to make a decent living in the twenty-first century.
But it is not enough simply to make this statement; if Parliament really wanted to put an end to this injustice it would take binding measures and force all employers without exception to respect the principle of equal treatment for men and women on pain of heavy penalties.
There are areas in which Parliament is able to adopt binding measures.
But judging by the woolly proposals in the report, there is no question of adopting coercive measures towards employers.
Under these circumstances, even if the European Parliament votes in favour this will be a complete waste of time.
It will be up to working women to impose equality themselves, joining forces with the workers to demand a living wage for all.
Mr President, Mrs Smet's report is the outcome of serious study as well as political experience and personal commitment, which is why it was enthusiastically adopted by a large majority in committee.
It deals with a general practice, which is common to all the social and economic systems of Europe, a harsh reality which will cancel out all legislative progress, be it at national or European level.
Women have difficulty not just in accessing work but in advancing their careers and levels of pay.
The last report on employment tell us that most of the Member States have given up trying to right this wrong and that this issue is missing from the social dialogue agenda in most countries.
We urge the Commission to call on the Member States to conduct a serious assessment, as the rapporteur suggests.
And to avoid repeating what has been said by my fellow Members, with whom I fully concur, I should like to suggest to you, Commissioner, that we take a global approach to this issue both in your policy and in that of the Member States.
The political practices which apply in numerous countries in the European Union in the area of women's employment, social protection and pensions marginalise them professionally, marginalise their ambitions, efforts, competitiveness and claims and hence their pay.
Our role, your role is a difficult one; we must convince public opinion and women themselves that all these issues are interlinked. We must convince them that their so-called vested rights run counter to their interests and to the quality and viability of and pay for their work.
Commissioner, please help the governments bear the political price which this endeavour and change usually imply.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Smet on this own-initiative report and on the thorough, comprehensive document before us.
The wage gap between men and women is a well-known phenomenon which is present in all the States of the Union, although in different proportions, and the issue has been on our agendas for a long time now. Previous speakers have mentioned the World Labour Organisation Convention of 1951, the provisions of the Treaty of Rome, the 1995 directive and the Treaty of Amsterdam.
A great deal has been done, including in terms of the measures to be taken.
The Commission has been presenting recommendations for over 10 years now, sometimes at Parliament' s request; I also remember the code of conduct prepared by the Commission which sought to raise awareness in the Member States and the two sides of industry in order to take practical action in this field.
Although the information is still not complete, analysis of the phenomenon allows us to understand the reasons for the existence of the differentials.
There are structural reasons, which have been recorded, such as age, training, seniority, and precarious and part-time work, in which mainly women are employed.
However, there is also genuine discrimination, direct discrimination - in some cases there is unequal pay for equal work - but, above all, value discrimination: women' s work is still considered to be of less value than men' s, even when they have the same qualifications and responsibilities.
Here is an example from my country: it was only in the mid-1980' s, after 15 years of campaigning, that a pay rise was at last obtained in the textile workers' pay agreement for the category of workers 'packing supervisor' , which exists in the textiles sector. This only happened, that is, when women lost their jobs during restructuring in this profession, which had been a typically female profession, and men began to be employed as well.
I feel that this is a tangible example of an issue which was only resolved in Italy in the mid-80s and which still remains unresolved today in a great many other situations.
The rapporteur has made numerous proposals and, in my opinion, we should follow her recommendations.
The Commissioner and the Commission are very open to such proposals and the employment guidelines for 2002 make this a priority too.
Mr President, I too want to begin by thanking Mrs Smet for the excellent job she has done and, in particular, for the high quality of her explanatory statement.
Looking at this report, we all have to acknowledge a sad fact today. In spite of the many initiatives taken over the years and in spite of the positive action taken by the Commission, the pay gap between the women and men of the European Union remains.
Not only do women on average earn 28% less than men for a job of equal value, often their jobs are also more precarious and unpleasant, an issue that is not raised often enough.
More women than men are unemployed and more of them are long-term unemployed; finally, most of the time it is they who look after the children and sometimes other dependents too.
Of course we have to take action, and in several directions.
That is why I agree with the spirit and the proposals in this report: we need to set up a group of experts to improve the collection of statistical data; it is a good idea to launch a major Europe-wide campaign in 2002; and it would no doubt be useful to take that opportunity to publish a comparative report on the various Member States.
Similarly, as the rapporteur proposes, we must review the 1975 directive and do something about training, to ensure that women really have the right to lifelong training, encourage the social partners to increase the participation of women in collective bargaining and, finally, take measures to help reconcile working and family life.
To ensure, however, that this goes beyond statements of intent, all the political leaders of the Union really must get down to work and clearly state their resolve to do so.
Indeed, at a time when we are entering a new world and facing terrible challenges, those who govern us must realise that this situation is not just discriminatory and unjust, it is not just counterproductive; it is a daily contradiction of the values we believe in and the model of society that Europe must uphold.
Mr President, I too should like to make a point of congratulating Mrs Smet, whose report demonstrates her personal knowledge of and experience in this matter.
The pay differential is the clearest and plainest expression of inequality between the sexes.
We have heard data and analyses of the causes of the present inequality and I do not intend to repeat them.
I intend to talk about what is being done today in terms of policy and planning.
As you know, the fourth line of action in the strategy on employment, which relates to equal opportunities, has dealt with the issue of unequal pay since the strategy on employment was first implemented back in 1999.
Over the years, from 1999 onwards, the Commission has evaluated the policies of each Member State on the question of equal pay.
What we have found over the last three years is that several, not all of the Member States, have noticed the differential, have noticed the problem and have proposed policies and measures to combat it.
The Commission refers specifically to this issue every year in its joint report on the basis of the data at its disposal and makes suggestions to the Member States as regards their policies.
The question which arises here is what tools does the Commission have at hand to make this assessment. And this, of course, is where we come up against the problem of indicators and statistics to which Mrs Smet referred.
We need new subjects and new statistical analyses of them so that we can formulate the problem in absolute terms.
The Commission is already working on this and I should like to give you one example.
We need a statistical analysis of the ratio between men and women as regards the hourly wage for paid employees working longer than 15 hours.
We need to analyse gross and net salaries in the public and private sectors and that means a breakdown by age, education, profession, economic activity, type of work and employment status.
Very few countries have statistics in the form which I have referred to.
And apart from the problem of the subject of the statistical analysis, we also have the problem of how to carry out statistical research.
In some Member States, there is a huge gap between the date on which data is collected and the date on which the final results are published.
And this does not just apply to the Member States, it also applies to some of the statistics published by the European Union itself.
So improving statistics, which are a very important tool for improving policies, is our number one priority.
You will see that this year's suggestions to several Member States refer specifically to the need to improve statistics systems.
The second basic point concerns the guidelines for 2002.
I appreciate that this is a very clear strategy which calls on the Member States to set specific targets to reduce the wage differential between men and women.
And, of course, our objective is to work with all the Member States and to exchange best practices so that some countries can imitate changes which are already under way.
The third point I wish to raise is that in the fifth programme, which is starting up now - the evaluation of the proposals submitted is being completed - the first priority when selecting proposals is the question of equal pay.
We have divided the priorities which need to be set by the programme into five individual areas so that we can study the question of equal pay and move on to the question highlighted by several lady Members, that is, the need for an integrated strategy.
A few days ago, on 13 September, the Belgian Presidency and the Commission held a major conference on the question of equal pay.
Mr President, honourable Members, may I say that our final decision on revising the existing directive will take account of the results of all these actions and the policy evaluation which I mentioned.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Harassment in the work place
The next item is the report (A5-0283/2001) drawn up by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on harassment at the workplace.

Mr President, the subject of this own-initiative report is certainly not a new problem, but a problem only recently highlighted.
According to the Dublin Foundation, harassment in the workplace is on quite an extensive scale.
Eight percent of EU citizens, or around twelve million people, have felt harassed in the workplace during the past twelve months.
What is this due to, and are there any connections to be made? Yes.
We know, for example, that insecurity of employment plays a role. We also know that those who are harassed suffer more stress than others.
We know that those with high-pressure jobs also suffer more.
The issue is one of security in working life and the organisation of work.
What are the consequences of harassment?
Harassment naturally has consequences for the individual, who feels less well, is absent from work more often and is ill more often.
The whole team, including those who are not themselves being bullied, functions less well.
Bullying also has consequences for companies in the form of lower productivity, reduced profitability and poorer working conditions within the company
I have been asked why the EU should concern itself with these issues and what all this has to do with the Community.
Well, harassment in the workplace is a problem common to all Member States, but it receives very different attention in different places.
In recent years, we have increasingly started to talk about more job opportunities and better workplaces, that is, about the quality of working life.
Quality in working life is about health and safety and the organisation of work, and so harassment in the workplace is a problem.
The EU has had legislation for a long time regarding health and safety at work.
What do we need to do?
Firstly, we have to review the definition of harassment and, at the same time, try to obtain a common definition.
We have to obtain significantly better statistical data, and the Dublin Foundation and Eurostat have a future role to play in this connection.
We also have to work on the open coordination method.
Member States need to develop their legislation, regulations, etc. so that best practice prevails, and that means looking at each others' solutions.
The Lisbon Process also includes qualitative indicators.
Where does legislation come in?
Should we state in advance that legislation is not needed in this area, bordering as it does upon another area in which the EU already has legislation, namely that of health and safety?
We currently have a major ongoing debate on health and safety in which it is assumed that it is not only the physical, but also the psycho-social, working environment which has an impact and which will be of ever greater significance for the new working life of the future.
Women in particular are affected by atypical jobs, insecure employment, etc.
The issue of legislation is highlighted in two points in the report, although it is not stated that we definitely should have legislation or how such legislation should be formulated.
In issuing its communications about a Community strategy concerning health and safety at work and the strengthening of the quality dimension in employment and social policy, as well as in publishing its Green Paper on Corporate Social Responsibility, the Commission is urged to take account of the problem of harassment in the workplace and to consider the need for legislation.
Of course, it is possible that the Commission will say that we do not need, and will not have, such legislation.
In that case, we shall have to conduct an analysis, but I find it pretty incomprehensible why the possibility of legislation should be ruled out in advance.
It is likely that the framework directive on health and safety at work also covers aspects of the psycho-social working environment, but we would like clarification on this point.
If we receive such clarification, there is no problem but, otherwise, the scope of the framework directive will have to be expanded to include the essential 'new' area.
In this context, it must also be considered whether there is a need for some kind of regulations or legislation regarding harassment in the workplace.
Let me take an example from my own country.
We have framework legislation which states that the employer is responsible for dealing with harassment in the workplace when this occurs.
It does not state in detail how, in fact, it should be dealt with, but it is clear that the employer has a responsibility.
Paragraph 24 of the report urges the Commission to publish a Green Paper on the situation regarding harassment in the workplace and then to present an action programme.
This is probably the most important point in the whole report.
Mr President, first of all, allow me to congratulate the instigator of this report, Mr Andersson: he has tackled a new issue that is regulated in some measure in only a few Member States.
I welcome the fact that, as frequently happens, Europe leads the way in a number of cases.
Well done.
Why did the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities give its opinion specifically on this subject matter?
It is, of course, a problem which affects men and women alike, but our committee considered that women often, far more often in fact, fall victim to this and other kinds of harassment, which very often lead to sexual harassment.
Our committee therefore had its role to fulfil and has issued its advice.
I think that we should all be aware of the fact that this is a new problem.
We can learn from the measures which many Member States have taken in terms of sexual violence, for coming up with a policy to tackle moral intimidation in the work place is not so easy or self-evident.
But there are a number of Member States that are attempting to do just that, and many Member States have experience of combating sexual violence.
What can we do?
First of all, a preventive approach can be adopted, which means that companies must make it clear to their staff that they do not tolerate harassment at work.
That would introduce a preventive stance.
Secondly, an intermediary could be appointed who could mediate between two parties if a problem arises.
To reach a solution in a company via mediation is always preferable to one of the parties having to take matters to court.
I prefer this type of solution.
Thirdly, if a solution is difficult to find, the management could impose penalties.
Fourthly, the option of going to court must at any rate remain open.
The above appear to me to be practical solutions which we could put in place.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been intending to discuss the problem of workplace harassment here in the European Parliament for some time.
The debate has been a long time coming, for the question which has always arisen is this: is this House the right forum for this debate?
Some members of my group reject the report because they believe that this is not a European issue.
The majority will follow my recommendation and vote for the report, because it is indeed a Europe-wide issue and problem.
Bullying exists in every country of the European Union, in all sectors, and even in the EU institutions themselves. It is a difficult issue.
It is very embarrassing for many people, and a large number of cases go unreported because no one really wants to talk about it. Victims feel ashamed, exploited and stressed.
Their distress often has a high cost, not only in terms of their own mental and physical health, but also economically: sick leave, medical and treatment expenses, a high staff turnover, lower productivity, a loss of quality and image for the company or institution, and therefore also a decline in the number of customers.
Bullying causes all these problems.
The dignity of every individual should not be upheld solely on paper and in the Basic Law, but also in our social relations.
A little more respect and fairness and a little less egotism would probably make our debate about harassment unnecessary.
European legislation is unsuitable as a means to address the causes of bullying and is likely to be ineffective.
I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation and for including my ideas in his report.
Measures to tackle bullying should focus primarily on the Member State and actively include the social partners.
It is in companies' own interests to ensure that these incidents do not occur within their organisations.
Due to the difficulties in arriving at a precise definition, the Commission will not find it easy to draft its proposed Green Paper.
However, there are a few models of good practice in tackling bullying here in the European Union, and I believe that everyone should learn from each other.
Tasks must be assigned effectively to the most appropriate levels; this will also increase the desire to take action and ensure that this difficult issue is taken seriously.
I want first of all on behalf of my group to thank the rapporteur for this report.
It is an important report because harassment is a far too prevalent problem in the workplace.
My group will be supporting the report as it stands in its entirety and will not be expecting or requesting any deletions of parts of paragraphs or phrases.
It is a sad fact that the Dublin Foundation has found that over 15 million people have reported violence, sexual harassment or bullying in the workplace.
It should not be allowed to continue because this kind of bullying and harassment can be fatal and has in many instances resulted in people either taking their own lives or, through misadventure in the workplace, in others taking their lives.
It seems to me therefore that it is something which the Commission and the Parliament should address.
Legislation is in place in Ireland, as part of the health and safety legislation, to ensure that large companies put in place codes of practice to deal with bullying.
However, it is not clear yet to what extent companies have implemented this legislation.
I came across a case recently where a young man starting in a job in a state company was bullied consistently by older men in the job, not by women, but by men, who simply did not want him in that job because they felt threatened by his presence.
They did not succeed in forcing him out of that job but it was extraordinary that this should occur in this day and age.
It is true that the trends emerging over the last ten years, as shown by the Dublin Foundation, have been on the rise.
It is clear also that this is largely due to insecurity in the workplace and changes in the nature of work.
Typical work is causing stresses and strains which are being reflected in this kind of activity, so I support the call by the rapporteur for a communication from the Commission by next year and a programme of action by the Commission by the end of next year.
Could I say before I sit down on an entirely different matter, but one related to the work of the Commission, that I would appeal to the Commissioner to ask our colleagues in the Commission to take steps to relax the rules and regulations governing state aid for the aviation industry, otherwise we are going to have to deal with tens of thousands of workers right across Europe who could well be unemployed in the not too distant future.
This is what I call harassment in the workplace.
I cannot speak without people smoking behind me and that gives me an asthma attack and that is harassment.
I congratulate Mr Andersson on his report.
It is important for action at both national and European level because, as we have heard, 12 million people are harassed or bullied in the workplace every year.
There are many forms of harassment and as I said, smoking in the workplace in no-smoking areas is a form of harassment.
It can also have devastating effects, both physically and pyschologically.
The level of stress caused by bullying and harassment in a workplace is tremendous.
Disabled people, women and in particular, ethnic minorities, suffer a great deal.
They can be doubly discriminated against and are harassed simply because they come from those disadvantaged, discriminated groups.
I am also glad that Mr Andersson referred to those on short-term contracts because again we have evidence that those too, are bullied.
But can I turn quickly to the reason for the split votes that the ELDR has asked for on paragraphs 8 and 13.
I believe that it is a role of the European Union to have common guidelines, best practice and benchmarking across the Member States, but I do not believe that we need more binding legislation: that is a role for the Member States and a question of subsidiarity.
So although I agree with much of Mr Andersson's report, I disagree with the fact that we should have binding legislation and that is why we have called for the split vote.
Mr President, my group would also like to congratulate Mr Andersson for his work on this excellent own-initiative report: it has been a very good evening for those.
As has already been said, we should not underestimate the effect that harassment in all its forms has on people's lives and health and the long-term mental and psychological problems we have heard about.
If we are looking at figures, then if we were to take this Parliament as an example, we would be looking at a group roughly the size of the Liberal Democrat group as the percentage of those suffering harassment.
Up to now, very little has really been done to address the problem of harassment generally, so this report is especially welcome as it allows an open debate on an issue that has all too often been ignored.
A French survey also reveals that 70% of harassment of victims are women and this applies at all points of the employment process, so not only do you get paid less, you get harassed as well, and chauvinist and sexist connotations, which are more often targeted at women than at men, can frequently turn into something more serious.
Therefore the Commission should give particular attention to ways of tackling this unacceptable situation for women in Europe.
Mr Andersson is right, employers must have the responsibility for preventing harassment in the workplace, not colluding with it, or practising it.
However the framework directive on health and safety at work does not clarify whether employers are responsible for the mental, psycho-social or social working environment, so I believe steps should be taken to revise the directive to include this definition.
Mr President, I would also like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his work, although we do not have a definition of harassment, perhaps because harassment takes many forms and is difficult to define.
I would like to express my solidarity with, and sympathy for, Mrs Lynne, who has just told us of a new form of harassment.
By way of analysis, an acceptable definition seems to me to be that of the Irish working group for the prevention of harassment, which defines it as direct or indirect, inappropriate and repeated behaviour of a verbal, physical or other nature, directed by one or more persons against a third party or parties in the workplace and/or in the execution of their work, which may justifiably be considered to violate an individual' s right to dignity at work.
And, of course, an isolated incident of behaviour such as that described in the definition may constitute an affront to dignity at work, but an individual and isolated incident would not be considered harassment.
We can accept this definition or any other.
The fact is that up to 12 million people in the European Union claim to have been morally harassed over the last twelve months, women appear to be victims of harassment to a greater extent than men and certain sectors of activity seem to be particularly affected.
Harassment has repercussions for the economy of the company, leads to absenteeism, inefficiency and low productivity.
For society, harassment may lead to medical and psychological costs, sick leave, early retirement, etc.
Above all it affects the worker and presents risks which add to problems of physical violence and ergonomic issues.
Furthermore, there remains much to do in order to eliminate risks to health, both of a physical and chemical origin.
Above all, moral harassment, pestering - which is one possible name for it - seems to me incompatible with Article 1 of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights: 'Human dignity is inviolable.
It must be respected and protected' .
Harassment therefore constitutes a risk to health but above all an attack on the person' s dignity.
I therefore welcome this initiative aimed at preventing harassment in the workplace and at preventing workers suffering the pain of helplessness.
Mr President, the question of harassment in the workplace relates directly to respect for fundamental personal rights, the right to dignity and the right to participate in economic and social life on equal terms.
In his initiative, Mr Andersson has revealed new aspects to us which need to be borne in mind when it comes to the material application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to a more integrated approach to policy on employment standards.
Most importantly, we should welcome this initiative because it gives us an opportunity, with an issue which is played down and which is usually included in our interests as an afterthought, to see how important it is if we are to issue a successful series of policies, such as a policy against discrimination and exclusion, a policy for the disabled, a policy for unemployment and employment standards.
Only once all employees feel safe in the workplace from harassment from colleagues and superiors, once all employees, rather than being ridiculed for their disadvantages, feel comfortable in the work environment, then the groups - and there are a lot of them - which fall victim to harassment will choose to enter the labour market and the fruits of their labour will far exceed any weaknesses they may have.
If we bear in mind that, according to the statistics, the number of people which make up these vulnerable groups is over 8%, the political dimension is easy to see.
At the same time, there are numerous groups which fall victim to harassment, from women and the disabled to foreigners and people of a different faith.
This gives us an idea of the size of the problem.
We must use this report as a springboard to draw up a plan to combat all levels of harassment, which starts as simple sarcasm and disdain, coupled with intimidation, humiliation and undermining, and ends up in more violent acts, a plan which will be applied irrespective of whether it is top-down harassment of an employee by a superior, bottom-up harassment or horizontal harassment.
In addition to measures to ban harassment, the action plan must require employers to foster a climate of non-harassment between colleagues, accompanied by mutual encouragement between colleagues in the workplace.
And because no one is deliberately bad, it must be flanked by measures to abolish distrust and superstition towards the people which make up these groups.
Mr President, the report we are discussing today concerns 12 to 15 million people in Europe, that is, between 8% and 10% of European workers.
There are three aspects to this modern evil.
There is an economic aspect, since according to the report of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions the deterioration in working conditions over the past 10 years is due to the faster working rate and to flexibility in all its forms.
There is a sociological aspect, symptomatic of the individualism that is increasingly threatening to take over our society.
There is a psychological aspect, which makes harassment particularly odious and can sometimes cause individuals to suffer a breakdown without leaving the slightest trace.
At present there is a serious legal vacuum at national level and a wide disparity at European level, which, however, is being counteracted by an increasingly solid body of case law.
That is why this report, which is well documented and rigorous, provides a highly encouraging response and sends out a strong signal to the working environment.
In paragraph 12, among the envisaged measures, it emphasises the need for more serious dialogue on this subject between all the social partners and the appointment of an independent external mediator, as also advocated in the amendment I tabled, which I regard as an important guarantee of real progress in this field.
But it is up to all the European institutions to continue to fight an evil that is now firmly entrenched, as they have been urged to do since the European Social Charter.
I therefore welcome the rapporteur's proposal to call on the Commission to publish a Green Paper and to present a Community action programme by next year.
On behalf of my group I also support the inclusion of these matters in the Green Paper discussions on corporate social responsibility.
We must all support this fight, at our own level, persuaded as we are that society as a whole will enjoy the benefits of balance within society and within individuals.
Mr President, around 12 million people in the EU are reported to have been subjected to bullying at work.
The real figure is far higher.
The victims suffer exclusion and harassment, rumours are spread about them, they are deliberately denied information and scapegoated.
Managers or staff - anyone can become a victim or a bully.
The impact of harassment is still completely underestimated, so very few effective instruments are available.
Yet it is a serious workplace problem.
It causes aggression and stress, sickness, resignations, staff turnover - all of which cost the economy and the social systems several 100 million euro per year.
Together, the fifteen EU Member States must take stock of the situation.
Best practice approaches will help us all benefit from an exchange of experience and devise effective measures to combat the problem.
However, solutions must be tailored to the type of bullying involved, which can be gender-specific, age-specific or racist.
Jan Andersson has submitted an outstanding report.
It was quite rightly adopted unanimously by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Almost all the proposed amendments from the PPE-DE have been integrated, such as consultation with Europe's social partners on developing joint anti-harassment strategies.
In practice, this will involve constructive conflict management, better internal communications, and the creation of support networks for victims.
We also propose appointing a confidential mediator at the workplace to whom employees can turn if they so wish.
Ms Diamantopoulou, we firmly expect the Commission to submit a Green Paper next year on the issue of bullying at work so that we can develop an action programme which will have a sustained impact.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his excellent report.
I quite agree that harassment is an extremely important issue, it is dangerous in the workplace and it has significant social and economic repercussions not just on the employee and the company but also on the economy as a whole in that it is one of the main reasons for falling productivity.
I should like to assure the House that the Commission is fully aware of the problem, which is why this issue is one of the important aspects of the Commission communication on standards released in June and one of the issues for which we are also examining the question of indicators.
Similarly, as regards current tools, I must remind you that the social partners need to provide protection and can play an important role here and remind you of Directive 89/391/ÅC which states that, when preventing danger in the workplace, account must also be taken of psychosomatic pressure which, of course, is not always easy to define.
I should like to inform you that an advisory committee of representatives of the Member States is already up and running and is examining the question of health and safety. It has set up a sub-committee especially to study the question of violence in the workplace.
This committee completed its work yesterday and we now have a general definition of violence in the workplace.
The proposal for an initiative and a Green Paper on this subject is not feasible now and I can tell you why immediately. As you know, the Commission has taken the initiative to overhaul its strategy on health and safety in the workplace.
And this report will play an important part; it will help bring about change and propose a new strategy on health and safety and for this reason I should like to make a point of thanking the rapporteur.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Air pollution
The next item is a joint debate on the following reports.
A5-0293/2001 drawn up by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on behalf of Parliament's Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants, and
A5-0293/2001 drawn up by Mrs Riitta Myller on behalf of Parliament's Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants.
Mr President, it is nearly three years since the Commission tabled a proposal for a directive amending the rules on the emission of pollutants from large combustion plants.
After those three years, we have this week finally reached completion of this - what I believe to be - very important dossier.
Nobody will blame me for saying that we have travelled an arduous road, a road that has also been peppered with painful experiences.
We have met with a great deal of opposition, not only on the part of a number of Member States, but also among some fellow MEPs.
There have been strong warnings and protests from interested parties, also from the electricity industry in some Member States.
Despite this, we managed to amend without any problem the original regulation in the form it was submitted and which, in my opinion - and that shared by a few fellow MEPs - was far too weak.
After all, the technical possibilities are not lacking, and in a large number of the EU Member States, those rules which we incorporated at first reading have long since been prescribed and form part of regular policy.
The original Commission proposal to amend the directive from 1998 was, according to the majority of this House, not a huge success.
Regulation was too weak and moreover, existing plants were excluded from the directive' s scope.
We as the European Parliament have collectively given real significance to the environmental policy, and I should once again like to extend a warm thanks to all the fellow MEPs who contributed to this.
We have demonstrated what it means if we really want to do something about this filthy air pollution, which is so harmful to people.
We as Parliament made great improvements to emission standards at first reading, and we also brought existing combustion plants within the scope of the directive.
Then came the Council' s collective standpoint.
This was arrived at with the greatest difficulty, it has to be said.
Legislation was tightened up to some extent, but the European Parliament' s wish for existing combustion plants to be brought within the scope of the directive was accommodated.
But alas, each country stipulated its own exceptions, and had it been up to the Council of Ministers, we would have continued using old, outdated polluting plants ad infinitum.
In our opinion, the common position lacked all vision.
It had become a pick-and-mix with something for everyone.
If I compare this with the regulations which currently apply in Japan and the United States, we, who all want things to be done just so, would have cut a very poor figure with the Council' s emission regulations during the discussions on Kyoto.
There were calls that it was not necessary to prescribe regulations for combustion plants because this was to be addressed by Mrs Myller' s very fine report on emission ceilings, and that there was therefore no need to interfere as a European authority until those emission ceilings were in place, for everything was to be regulated on that basis, every Member State adopting them as a binding measure.
But things on that front too ultimately took a different turn.
If we were to meet the expectations of those in favour of liberalising the energy market, in other words, if we did not prescribe any regulations or if we agreed to exceptions in order to generate electricity using old, polluting power stations, we believe that the market mechanism would be disrupted, and those who neglect the environment would be rewarded with a head-start, because they would be able to charge lower energy prices with their old power stations.
Since the Council refused to accept Parliament' s amendments, we had to resort to conciliation, whereby the present report was combined with the report by Mrs Riitta Myller.
I would like to thank her too.
She proved to be an excellent partner in those negotiations.
In fact, during the trilogue with the Swedish Presidency and the Commission in May and June of this year, considerable progress was made straight away where the emission reduction of SO2, sulphur dioxide and a number of major technical topics were concerned.
As for NOx and the nitrogen oxides, progress was only made with the greatest difficulty.
At the trilogue, agreement was reached provisionally on the Commission' s obligation to extend monitoring - for which we have Mr Hans Blokland to thank - to include emissions of heavy metals.
In addition, the Council met Parliament half-way and deleted certain exceptions, especially for certain plants which are fired with solid fuels and native brown coal.
Unfortunately, during the first meeting, we failed to reach genuine agreement on what strikes me as the most important point, namely NOx.
After first reading, we made huge progress when the Council agreed to allow old plants to be brought within the scope of the directive.
That was important because those old plants are often least efficient in terms of energy, and also emit a disproportionate amount of greenhouse gases.
By means of the compromise achieved by conciliation, the European Parliament managed to tighten the proposed limits for SO2 and NOx.
The Council agreed, straight away in fact, to a considerable reduction in SO2, especially for the medium-size and large combustion plants, for that is where it matters most.
With regard to NOx emissions, we as Parliament upheld the reduction of NOx limits for large combustion plants between 650 mg per cubic metre and 200 mg for those plants which run on solid fuels.
These limits, however, only apply from 2016 to new and existing plants.
That is, in fact, too late.
As I stated earlier, a number of Member States introduced these standards some three years ago.
We did not object to this for it marked a huge step forward, also in view of the fact that this is an important condition which we will soon be able to apply to the candidate countries.
Furthermore, we managed to reduce the exception which the Council wanted for peak-load power stations, with the result that the polluting emission can be curtailed in this respect too.
All in all, I am therefore of the opinion that conciliation produced a satisfactory agreement and that we went much further than we deemed possible at second reading.
I thank the Swedish Presidency.
I thank all my fellow MEPs, especially Mrs Myller.
I thank the Commission for its constructive support.
I would therefore recommend, also on behalf of the delegation, that this proposal be adopted.
Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament' s objective with respect to this directive was to achieve the strictest possible ceilings for air emissions responsible for acidification.
Acidification, ground-level ozone, and soil eutrophication are interconnected problems caused by emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, volatile organic compounds and ammonia.
It seems only reasonable to examine these problems together, as in that way we could succeed in reducing emissions in the most cost-effective way.
On this basis, the Commission in its proposal had calculated for each Member State the ceilings they should achieve by the year 2010.
In both the fifth environmental action programme and its acidification strategy, the Community - the European Union - laid down its objective to guarantee that people would be protected from all known air pollutants.
The Commission stated in its proposal that at this stage it was unable to set 'final targets' for critical loads and levels: to achieve a final, long-term objective it was necessary to proceed via some interim target values, which the Commission set for 2001.
Except with regard to ammonia, Parliament approved the Commission' s targets in its second reading, with the addition of a long-term objective.
In Parliament' s view, the interim target values should be achieved by 2010, and the final objective, whereby people would be protected throughout the EU from all known atmospheric pollutants, should be achieved by 2020.
By the time it had reached the conciliation stage all positions were clear, and the Council clearly gave us to understand that it was unable to alter the figures, which it had approved within the framework of a common position.
Neither was it prepared to approve the long-term objective on the grounds that the demand that critical levels and loads should not be exceeded in any area was not, in the opinion of the Council and the Commission too, technically feasible.
The Council' s common position on emission ceilings was a long way from the Commission' s figures relatively speaking, but, nevertheless, better than the 'Gothenburg' values that most of the Member States had sworn by.
Approval of the Council' s common position would have meant that we would have been raising our hands in favour of improving air quality and protecting the health of our citizens.
At the conciliation stage, after some considerable amount of arm wrestling, with the Commission busy producing compromises, the main principles of the directive were pulled in the direction of Parliament' s views.
During conciliation the Commission' s and Parliament' s stricter emission limits were approved as indicative values and the Council' s common position was recognised as binding on Member States.
Indicativeness means the Commission is obliged to reappraise the directive in its reports for 2004 and 2008, taking account of future scientific and technological developments and hence the possibility of achieving stricter emission limits.
With these investigations it must also be considered to what extent the long-term objectives can be achieved by 2020.
The result of conciliation was thus to give the Commission the tools to make the directive' s target levels stricter and require it to study reductions in emissions in the long-term also, the aim being that critical levels and loads are not exceeded and that people really are protected effectively from all atmospheric pollutants.
It was quite an achievement to have this long-term objective included in an Article of the directive, but it was perhaps the most important accomplishment during conciliation.
The emission sources causing acidification that are the hardest to deal with are emissions from aircraft and ships.
We have made progress in this area too, and the Commission is being asked to propose measures to deal with this problem.
I would also like to thank Ria Oomen-Ruijten for her excellent show of co-operation during conciliation.
It was really most significant that the directive on large combustion plants was dealt with so successfully, as it will be a key instrument in helping to carry through this directive on emissions ceilings.
I also want to thank the President of Parliament' s delegation, the Members, the representatives of the Commission and Sweden, as the country holding the presidency at the time, for their excellent show of co-operation.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate both the Parliament's rapporteurs on the hard work that they put in.
They produced a result which they can be proud of.
It was produced after an immense amount of work very late at night.
However, speaking as a British Member of the European Parliament there were enormous difficulties about these directives, particularly the Large Combustion Plants Directive.
I want to focus on the point that we laboured under the enormous difficulty that neither the Commission nor the Council really came clean about the impact of what they were proposing.
Nor did they give us an accurate assessment or help us assess the impact of what the European Parliament was proposing.
Mr Bowe and I, as British Members of the European Parliament, were faced with lobbies from Britain basically saying that if we adopted the Parliament's amendments, the British coal mines which are still in production would all have to close down.
We were therefore faced with the possibility of voting for amendments and voting for reports from our own committee which would have had a very serious economic impact in our own Member State.
When we went to the Council of Ministers meeting, we found that there were other Member States with exactly the same problems, Finland, for example, where the ministers and governments of those countries had never really contacted their Members of the European Parliament to explain the difficulties they thought they were going to have.
We also had the extraordinary situation, when we got to the codecision meeting, where four civil servants delivered speeches that really should have been made by ministers.
The point I want to make is this.
We need two things: we need much greater honesty from Member States and the Commission about the actual impact in the Member States of what is being proposed and what is being discussed.
There should at least be some advice on that.
Secondly, when we go to the codecision meetings we must stop having meetings between fifteen MEPs, one minister, and fourteen civil servants.
That is ridiculous.
Many of the points made to us on the reports by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mrs Myller should have been made by ministers.
It is ministers we want to meet when we go to the codecision meetings.
Mr President, I will just simply say first as a British Member, that I would endorse what Mrs Jackson said.
Only the people in this room really know just how much work both the rapporteurs did to reach this final position and to get these two reports as proposals to this Parliament for a final vote.
We are your peers and we know how much hard work you did and we congratulate you both on that work.
It has been a very long time and this is one of the most difficult reports I have seen in twelve years in Parliament.
Finally though, despite all the difficulties and even the final conciliation, we have a workable and practical proposal.
It is not going to be easy.
It is going, in fact, to be extremely hard with regard to some of the requirements, but it strikes a satisfactory balance between the protection of the environment on the one hand and society's need for a reliable and secure source of power at an affordable price, which is something we cannot ignore.
Changes are going to have to take place to meet the requirements of this proposal.
The power industry will undoubtedly be required to replace some old plant, hopefully by some more modern sources of power generation.
There is going to be a substantial reduction in sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions which are the main causes of acid rain and ground-level ozone with a consequent improvement in the environmental conditions for human health.
One possible side effect may be that as the general efficiency of power plant operation improves, we will see an overall reduction in carbon dioxide in comparison to the energy generated.
That would be a helpful and useful side effect of this legislation.
It will not be easy to put all these measures into place.
There is a long time scale.
That is acceptable and understandable in these circumstances, so on behalf of the Socialist Group, I welcome these proposals and we will give them our support in the vote tomorrow.
Mr President, I would like to welcome both the directives and congratulate both rapporteurs as other Members have done.
I have particularly followed the debate on the limitation of emissions of large combustion plants.
These plants are one of the biggest emitters of air pollutants in Europe after transport emissions and therefore it is very important we have stringent legislation to control this.
The inclusion of existing plants is a major improvement on former legislation.
It means there will be a level playing field for all plants including the worst polluters and some plants in the applicant countries, which can generate electricity more cheaply because they have fewer controls and do not have to meet the same standards.
Again, as other Members have said, we can reassure people that because of the various derogations and allowances for lower standards, which were built into the final compromise text, current power stations such as Aberthaw in my own constituency are under no threat.
Aberthaw coal-fired power station has been the subject of considerable press and media attention due to perceived threats to its viability and its profitability from this directive.
In fact the opposite is true.
The directive will actually protect jobs in the Welsh coal and generating industries in the longer term.
This has been a very important debate, because it has shown that there is not a straight choice between cleaner air standards and employment, as some would have us believe.
Work to combat pollution can go hand-in-hand with protecting jobs and sustaining communities.
My group also supports the compromise which tightens the limit values for sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide and introduces generally stronger standards.
The group also supports the results of the conciliation on Mrs Myller's report on the National Emission Ceilings Directive and we will be voting in favour of that too.
Mr President, I will confine myself to air pollution caused by large combustion plants.
I am still of the opinion that the outcome of conciliation has been overtaken by the current technical potential to reduce polluting emissions.
Bizarre exemption provisions were left in the directive, as well as the permission for large old combustion plants to pollute for 2 000 hours per year, and the exceptions for Spain, Crete and Rhodes.
Existing plants will continue to pollute the air enormously by emitting sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.
Particularly with regard to nitrogen oxides, the outcome of the conciliation is saddening, since at the moment, the standards in the United States already far outstrip those which will not come into force for a number of years in the European Union.
Moreover, we already notice that much biomass is being used as a supplement in coal-fired power plants.
For these, far less stringent emission standards apply compared to waste incineration plants.
I should have known that as a result of the liberalisation of the energy market, equal environmental conditions would be used to prevent distortion of competition.
In conclusion, the reason why I shall be voting in favour of this directive is not that it will effectively fight air pollution, but because, compared to the previous directive, this new directive is the lesser of two evils.
Mr President, my colleague, Ria Oomen-Ruijten, deserves praise for her work as rapporteur at all three stages of the reading of the directive on large combustion plants.
We have before us now a revised directive that can be expected to have an important impact on reducing emissions from large combustion plants, at the same time, however, taking account of the practical realities of life.
I am grateful for having been involved in tabling the amendments of compromise and that first the rapporteur and then Parliament adopted them.
These amendments are still visible in this directive even after conciliation and, among other things, make possible combined heat and power production, which is essential from the point of view of sustainable development.
At first there was a danger that the directive would have made CHP unprofitable.
That would clearly have meant a step backwards.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten' s report, like that of my colleague Mrs Myller, are examples of how the codecision procedure can also achieve a successful end result when the subject-matter is very difficult and demanding.
These two directives are obviously in this category.
National limits for emissions and emissions from large energy plants are matters in which Member States have traditionally looked after their own interests and tried to prevent the setting of targets that could jeopardise the competitiveness of Member States themselves or that of the EU as a whole.
The Commission had to take this into account when drafting its proposal.
Parliament too, for all its idealism, had to take account of political realities.
In spite of this, the result can be considered to be an ambitious one.
It will be important right away as far as air quality in Europe is concerned.
In addition, it indicates something important for the future: the EU is ready to work to achieve the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol within the framework of practical policy as well.
We still expect the Commission to make several important proposals this autumn to combat climatic change.
The two reports now to be decided on promise good results.
The EU institutions are capable of producing a balanced result, from which we can expect challenging results.
In the face of the facts of climatic change anything less is out of the question.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs for their tenacity and commitment.
I have no doubt that these were essential qualities during the negotiations with the Council, especially in the discussions about large combustion plants.
This House was determined to ensure that old plants were included in this directive as well, and finally achieved this goal.
This is a key area in which we have been successful.
However, we have not been entirely successful.
We have had to accept a great many derogations, extensions and lower limit values, not because no other option was technically feasible - for otherwise we would frequently have been accused of trying to achieve the impossible.
In this instance, it is quite obvious that upgrading existing plants to meet the standards in modern installations presents no problems from a technical point of view.
Indeed, in many sectors, this is already a reality.
No, the resistance focussed solely on microeconomic factors relating to specific large combustion plants.
This is a short-sighted view.
We must think macroeconomically and take account of the public health costs of pollution and harmful emissions.
In this respect, I simply cannot understand the Council's negotiating position on this issue.
However, as the directive now includes old plants, I shall vote for the compromise as well.
Mr President, neither the time nor the mood feels right for starting any sort of squabble - either with the Committee Chairman or with other British Members of this Parliament - on who has most to lose from acidification or measures against acidification.
Instead, I will try to be rather more positive and thank the British Members for managing to get through this directive and for ensuring that tomorrow we shall be able to make a decision.
To put it rather dramatically, this decision means that my region can come back to life and that forestry, the fishing industry and biodiversity will be given a chance to repair the damage which has occurred over decades and perhaps even a whole century.
This is an excellent example of the benefit of practical and solid European cooperation.
Through this kind of cooperation, we can achieve a change in my region which we should not have been able to bring about ourselves, that is, a halt to acidification.
Even if we cannot eradicate acidification completely, we can halt it and try to repair some of the damage which it has caused.
I look forward to the review which is to be carried out, as I know that such measures are insufficient.
Acidification will continue, despite the decision we shall make tomorrow.
I wish to thank the Members and the Commission for the work we have carried out together.
Mr President, honourable Members, I am very pleased that these two important additions to Community legislation on air pollution are reaching the stage of final adoption.
I join with you in congratulating and thanking both rapporteurs, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mrs Myller, for their efforts, but I would also like to thank the President of Parliament's delegation, Mr Friedrich, for his role in bringing these negotiations to a successful conclusion - unfortunately he cannot be here this evening - and Mr Provan for stepping in at the last moment in what proved to be one of the finest evenings of the summer.
The proposals on national emission ceilings (NECs) and large combustion plants (LCPs) represent a major advance in Community legislation on air pollution.
As you know, the NEC proposal would help to establish an ongoing programme for tackling transboundary air pollution by requiring Members States to limit the emissions which cause most damage, not only to themselves but, as Mrs Hulthén said, to their neighbours.
The first stage sets legally binding emissions ceilings which Member States will have to meet by 2010.
It provides for a series of periodic reviews - in 2004, 2008 and 2012 - in order to reduce emissions ceilings more in the future: this review system has been strengthened a great deal in response to Parliament's concerns.
The first reviews will try to make up the shortfall by 2010 taking into account total emissions for the Community as a whole as set out in the Commission original proposal.
All reviews will look at how we can achieve our long-term goals of staying below critical environmental levels after 2010.
The year 2020 will then be taken as a benchmark.
In subsequent reviews, the Commission will report, in particular, on progress towards attaining our long-term goals and, with these aims in mind, will consider what further measures are necessary to achieve these goals, as the rapporteur has said, "preferably by 2020".
At the same time, with the large combustion plant proposal, new and tougher emissions standards will apply in the power generation sector, in particular for older power plants which are a major cause of acidification and ozone pollution.
The Commission's analysis of the common position on large combustion plants shows that both sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from this sector will fall substantially as a result of this legislation.
The compromise on the LCP proposal will provide medium-term flexibility to take account of differing circumstances in the Member States as well as substantial environmental benefits in the long term in an enlarged Community.
Parliament has achieved a great deal in this debate and should be very proud of its contribution.
The Commission is pleased with the outcome.
By approving this legislation, the Commission will be under an obligation to return in 2004 to review both directives and present its proposals for further progress.
We have already explained how we intend to prepare for this first review in the communication on clean air for Europe which we presented in May 2001, and work is already under way on this.
In conclusion, I invite Parliament to adopt the outcome of conciliation and to join us in moving forward.
I look forward to Parliament's support for CAFE.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's session have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, my name is not on the list of those present at yesterday' s meeting, but I was present, as shown by the signatures to all my group' s meetings.
I would be grateful if you could have this oversight remedied.
Mr Santini, that will be corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
Mr President, I sat here throughout the debate yesterday on the statements by the Commission and the Council in relation to the tragedy in the United States.
Not a single mention was made of the crisis being faced by the aviation industry in Europe as a result of this atrocity.
It is incumbent on this House to make clear to the Commission and the Council that aid needs to be provided to the European airline industry and to the aviation industry in general, so that we can maintain a European aviation industry, particularly our airlines.
Otherwise, we would be in a very serious situation, particularly if, as is proposed, the United States provides aid to their airlines.
It is of the utmost importance that the tens of thousands of jobs currently under threat in the aviation industry are saved.
Mr De Rossa, we have noted your comments.
The agenda for the next session will be set by the Conference of Presidents.
We will put forward your suggestion.
Decisions on freezing assets or evidence
The next item is the report (A5-0274/2991) by Mr Marinho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative by the governments of the French Republic, the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Belgium for the adoption by the Council of a Framework Decision on the execution in the European Union of orders freezing assets or evidence (5126/2001 - C5­0055/2001 - 2001/0803(CNS)).
Mr President, this report concerns the recognition by one Member State of orders made by a court in another Member State on the freezing of assets or evidence within its territory in order to ensure the integrity of the legal process up to the final judgment.
This framework decision, which is an initiative by the governments of France, Sweden and Belgium, is to enter into force by 31 December 2002 and will apply to all the Member States without any need for ratification, a very important point indeed. This is the general position regarding mechanisms for the recognition of criminal sentences which have existed up to now.
In short this is about ensuring that an order made in one Member State automatically guarantees that assets and evidence essential for the prosecution and punishment of a crime and which may be located in any part of the European Union are not lost, do not disappear or are not concealed from criminal investigation.
In the original version of the decision, this mutual recognition mechanism relates to cross-border crimes such as drug trafficking, fraud affecting the European Communities' financial interests, laundering of the proceeds of crime, counterfeiting of the euro, corruption and trafficking in human beings.
However, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs considered that this classification of offences, which is limited to types of crime relating in particular to the functioning of the single market, excludes other criminal offences and especially, and this is indeed topical, the type of crime we are most concerned with now, crime relating to terrorism.
I believe that the new version of Article 2, prepared with the invaluable help of Mrs Palácio Vallelersundi and approved by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, is far more appropriate and effective in the context of an area of freedom, security and justice.
It is a matter of strengthening the principle of mutual recognition which will be the basis for the prosecution of criminals and criminal organisations in the European Union.
I think that we are now perfectly aware of the vital importance of this, and I therefore call on this Chamber to adopt Amendment No 5 on Article 2 of the original proposal for a decision, and ask the Commission and the Council to take this on board. This will bring the proposal for a decision before us in line with others which will soon follow in relation to the war on terrorism, as announced yesterday by Commissioner Vitorino.

Mr President, this decision, in as far as it goes, will make a small contribution to the creation of a European area of justice, but it is these small things, these small stones, that will build the foundations of a European area of justice capable of protecting our citizens.
In this way we can counter the judicial void that exists in Europe and thus fight against the inertia and bureaucracy of the institutions.
It is our job to prove to the public that Europe is also there to protect them, and that a European civil and criminal legal system is possible.
This is about promoting citizenship, of course, but it is also about fighting the anonymous and stateless crime which is so prevalent.
Not even the greatest pessimists would deny that these are steps in the right direction.
Isolationist sovereignty makes crime easier and helps criminals.
As from tomorrow, and I mean tomorrow, the date of the Extraordinary European Council, we will be speeding up the creation of a Europe of freedoms, that is to say the largest area of democracy, freedom and justice in the world.
Mr President, I endorse what the rapporteur, Mr Marinho, said.
The truly tragic events of last week emphasise the importance of the fight against terrorism and organised crime.
The coalition we are striving to build across the world to fight against terrorism is trying to find a cure to the problem, but there is also the issue of prevention in terms of security and diplomacy.
Other steps too are necessary if we are going to prevent those kinds of crimes from happening again.
The second directive on money laundering is already in conciliation and we are trying to get it through.
We have to recognise that at European Union level we need only one legal area.
It is illogical for people to apply for asylum between one Member State and another within the European Union.
It is illogical for us to have a situation where a warrant for arrest is not applicable across the whole of the European Union.
There was a case where someone fled to the United Kingdom from France and managed to stall his extradition back to France for the crime of terrorism.
He has actually faced the courts for a period of five years.
The series of reports we have before us this morning attempt to move things forward.
Mr Marinho's report is part of that initiative by the French, Swedish and Belgian governments and I congratulate him and them on this report.
A judicial decision in one Member State must have automatic application across the whole of the Union.
We must have the mutual recognition that Mr Marinho calls for.
Mr bin Laden has a London bank account.
One might hope that this report will make it easier for that account and similar accounts elsewhere in Europe to be frozen if that was proven necessary.
On behalf of the party of European Socialists, I support this report and the similar measures that will follow in the other reports this morning and in subsequent weeks and months.
The best memorial for those innocent people who died so tragically last week is to take action to prevent its repetition.
This is one small part of that process.
Mr President, the Commission welcomes the initiative by France, Sweden and Belgium on the mutual recognition of orders freezing assets or evidence.
This is in fact the first fundamental proposal to be made since the adoption by the Council and the Commission of the programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters.
I am also very grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Marinho.
His report is excellent and as he has stressed, mutual recognition will be a crucial step forward in judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
As you all know, traditional judicial cooperation is slow and bureaucratic, which runs totally counter to the interests of the public, and the current situation highlights the need for swift and effective judicial cooperation.
I also welcome the approach adopted by the rapporteur in his amendments, and in particular the implication that this initiative does not go far enough.
It only applies to a very limited list of offences already harmonised at EU level and does not cover certain traditional offences such as murder, armed robbery and rape.
Nor does it cover terrorist acts.
The rapporteur accordingly suggests that the provisions of the proposed decision should extend to any offence punishable by means of a custodial sentence or custodial security measure with a maximum duration of at least six months, and the Commission is totally in agreement with this.
Furthermore, the Commission is already advocating such an extension to the Council and negotiations are under way.
Parliament therefore has a good chance of making this initiative more ambitious, which would reflect the objectives of the Heads of State and Government, who established the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters at the Tampere European Council.
Mr President, it is in this spirit that I welcome the adoption of this positive and ambitious report.
Many thanks, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
External borders and Schengen
The next item is the report (A5-0233/2001) by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on crossing external borders and the development of Schengen cooperation (10846/1999 - C5­0042/2000) + (11329/3/1999 - C5­0043/2000) + (SCHAC 2533/1/2000 - C5­0729/2000) + (SEC(2000) 1439 - C5­0730/2000 - 2000/2015(COS)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation under Schengen started in 1985 between five Member States.
The idea was to abolish internal borders so as to allow the free movement of persons and to adopt compensatory measures, including measures concerning police cooperation, the fight against drugs, extradition and the creation of the Schengen Information System.
All the Member States now belong to Schengen, although the United Kingdom and Ireland only partially participate.
In addition, two non-member countries also participate, namely Iceland and Norway, which belong to the Nordic Passport Union.
With the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Schengen acquis has been integrated into the treaties and there has been a communitarisation of certain third pillar issues, which have been transferred to the Community pillar. This applies, for example, to visas, asylum, immigration and judicial cooperation on civil matters.
In the process of preparing this report, I had to deal with a number of issues which I would like to see resolved as quickly as possible.
The first of these is extension to include the remaining Member States.
Whilst welcoming the extension of the Schengen area, the European Parliament regrets the fact that it has not been sufficiently well informed or even formally consulted on the changes that have taken place in this area.
We see the partial participation of the United Kingdom and Ireland, which we regard as a positive development, as being a provisional situation and a step towards full participation.
Secondly, there is a lack of transparency.
Everyone hoped that the integration of the Schengen acquis would lead to a considerable improvement in transparency.
However, the results have been disappointing.
To be precise, the acquis was published late and not in full, and, paradoxically, the European Parliament now receives less information on Schengen than it used to receive when Schengen was of a clearly intergovernmental nature.
Thirdly, there is the issue of the integration of the acquis in the treaties.
This could have facilitated significant progress, but it has had a chaotic and incoherent impact, partly due perhaps to the power of initiative conferred on the Member States.
On the other hand, due to the restrictive interpretation of the treaty provisions by the Council, Parliament has been unable, under the third pillar, to participate more fully in the legislative process.
Fourthly, there is what I might call the 'perversion of Schengen' .
Article 2(2) allows any Member State to unilaterally re-impose internal border controls for reasons of public order or national security.
This has already been put into practice by France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and most recently by Italy.
We are not opposed to what might be called 'safety valves' .
We are all aware, especially at present, that greater freedom has to be matched by greater security.
However, it has to be said that the absence of a legal framework making clear under what conditions and in what terms this article can be invoked makes this a real blank cheque.
Accordingly, bearing in mind the scoreboard, I urge the Commission to bring forward a formal proposal including legislative provisions relating to prior agreement by the Council, approval for a limited period, a requirement for proportionality, and conditions for extending the period.
My fifth point concerns Schengen cooperation and police cooperation.
Schengen cooperation is distinct from police cooperation, with the development of Europol being a separate matter.
However, these two sets of legislative provisions, which are considered in isolation and which lend greater weight to the issue of the confidentiality of documents, mean that the area of criminal matters and security has become even less transparent and more confusing for the public.
As part of the third pillar, parliamentary and judicial checks on increased cooperation between the Member States are still inadequate and need to be reinforced.
My sixth point is the extension of the Schengen area to the candidate countries.
This extension will significantly change the shape of Europe and the new Member States will become responsible for controlling the thousands of kilometres of new external borders of the European Union.
The process of checking compliance with Schengen has taken a considerable amount of time for the existing Member States.
I therefore believe that a two-phase approach is required: the first stage being the acceptance of the acquis upon joining the Union, and the second stage being full implementation of the acquis, with borders being lifted as soon as circumstances allow.
The seventh point is the Schengen Information System, the SIS.
The SIS is the biggest database in Europe and the first experiment in terms of a large-scale exchange of sensitive data at international level.
In practice, it is hoped that in the long term it will become a European information system.
The SIS cannot continue to be managed secretly on a purely intergovernmental basis.
Instead it should be managed on a Community basis, with the task of managing it being entrusted to an independent agency over which this Parliament should have a control function; it should be financed from the EU budget and provision should be made for a Community information system, which by keeping the data separate, could contain data collected under various agreements.
Mr President, I would like to conclude by thanking all those fellow Members who have assisted with the preparation of this report, and in particular Mrs Van Lancker for her help with the various compromise amendments.
Mr President, the United Kingdom is largely outside the provisions of the Schengen acquis.
The policy of the British Conservatives towards Schengen is therefore rather like our policy towards the euro.
We wish our neighbours and allies well, but it is not our businesses to tell them how to run initiatives which we have no intention of joining ourselves.
Accordingly, as is becoming traditional on these occasions, my party will be abstaining.
There is another matter which is becoming traditional on these occasions.
No report on Schengen is complete without a ritual complaint about the failure of the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic to take part.
Thus, in Mr Coelho's otherwise admirable report, we have paragraph 2, which in a somewhat brusque tone calls on those two states to abolish their border controls.
This Parliament has repeatedly expressed the viewed, echoed by Commissioner Vitorino, that the UK opt-out is illegal under the terms of the Single European Act.
I believe that this is legally flawed, but that is not my point today.
My point rather, is that by persistently seeking to challenge a derogation which was clearly understood by all sides at the time, this Parliament is acting in bad faith.
It is worth recalling the circumstances in which the Schengen Accord was built into the treaties.
That decision, like all treaty changes, required unanimity.
Without the consent of the United Kingdom, Schengen would have had to continue to exist within a separate legal framework.
The British government took the view that if other states wished to go ahead on their own using the institutions and mechanisms of the European Communities then it was not Britain's place to hinder them.
Accordingly, it allowed the other states to push ahead within the treaties, but only subject to a clear guarantee that the UK's own border controls would not be affected.
That guarantee was written in black and white into the Amsterdam Treaty.
No sooner had Amsterdam come into force however, than the European Commission and Parliament began to question the opt-out.
Not for the first time, the UK had allowed other states to use the common procedures of the European treaties only for those states promptly to start clamouring for Britain's inclusion.
As with Schengen, so with the social chapter and so with economic and monetary union - in all three cases Britain consented to a new EU initiative on the clear understanding that it would not be affected, only for its derogation later to be disputed.
This surely is no way for the Union to proceed.
After all if opt-outs are no longer legally reliable, the only alternative is a rather more promiscuous use of the national veto and that I submit would be even more objectionable to the integrationist majority in this House than it is to me.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Coelho warmly on his sterling report and thank him in turn, on behalf of my group, for the sound cooperation.
What should really have been an annual debate on the implementation of the Schengen cooperation is today being afforded added topical value in the light of the Council of Ministers for Justice and for the Interior debating European measures to combat international terrorism.
Nobody will deny that Schengen could play a role in this.
I shudder at the thought that appeals such as those during yesterday' s sitting could be made by the Right, to put a definitive stop to the free movement of people and to put Big Brother-like mechanisms into place.
The Schengen discussion in my group has always sought to strike the necessary but difficult balance between the right to free movement of people, respect for the principles of the rule of law and human rights and the right to safety via police and judicial cooperation, and I should like to keep it that way.
However, despite the fact that Schengen has now been in existence for six years as a predecessor to the area of freedom, security and justice, we have to observe on the basis of Mr Coelho' s report that many aspects leave a great deal to be desired.
I should like to list three.
Firstly, although Schengen exists, we have to observe that there is still no effective police cooperation and no effective exchange of intelligence which could yield major results in the fight against organised crime.
In fact, the annual report states that there is a marked improvement, but the question is whether the right areas are being prioritised.
To put it bluntly, is the Schengen intelligence system being put to actual use in the fight against international crime and terrorism, as defined in the UN Convention?
Does it not mainly serve as an intelligence system to combat unwanted migration?
Please allow me to put this question to you again in today' s climate.
Secondly, Schengen does, however, appear to be used in the framework of demonstrations on the occasion of European and international summits.
No Democrat will object to the fact that trouble-makers who come to cause havoc are arrested.
But the way in which peaceful protesters are being arrested via internal border controls and the exchange of intelligence on the basis of the Schengen Information System is really a bridge too far for anyone who is in favour of freedom of expression.
Thirdly, police cooperation and the exchange of intelligence require proper monitoring by the legal systems and parliaments.
That is where Schengen really takes things too far.
It even goes so far that the Council has decided not to publish any more reports, since Schengen now supposedly forms part of the European acquis, as if Schengen ceases to exist as a result.
In any event, my group would like to see Schengen in fact replaced by transparent, democratically controlled European rules but, in anticipation of this, we want the European Parliament, in tandem with national parliaments, to monitor Schengen.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our objective is to develop the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice within which citizens' rights are respected and the free movement of persons is guaranteed.
However, for over 20 years now, association activists and many elected representatives have been advocating a citizens' Europe that demonstrates solidarity and is open not only to goods and capital but also and above all to persons.
For one brief moment, we had faith in the hope that was born in Schengen, a hope that was virtually suffocated at birth by intolerance, a failure of courage and a lack of calm political analysis.
If Schengen represents a considerable step forward for Europe because of the progress made in certain areas, including police and judicial cooperation, it has to be said now that this step forward is a halting and discriminatory one.
Although the Schengen Convention has come into force in its entirety in several Member States, there are still inequalities that affect persons who do not hold a European nationality or have the necessary papers, although certain persons or members of their family may have lived in Europe for very many years.
Some Member States do not grant the same rights to everyone resident in their country, even if they all accept the same responsibilities.
On top of this, we have an immigration and asylum policy that varies from one country to another, differing procedures and controls and repressive police practices leading to dramatic situations in human terms such as those we are now witnessing at Sangatte in the north of France.
At the very heart of Europe, in the Channel Tunnel, thousands of men, women and children are risking their lives every day in an attempt to enter the United Kingdom.
These people, while awaiting their journey, are concentrated in a reception centre in humanely unacceptable conditions supported only by humanitarian organisations without any power or means at their disposal, such as the Red Cross.
These practices bring back some bitter memories.
The political authorities still treat refugees and asylum-seekers with coldness, hypocrisy and intolerance.
This is unacceptable in the wake of the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Just imagine that police officers have even dared to fire real bullets at asylum seekers!
In fact you do not have to imagine it, because other police forces in Europe have already done it.
These facts are continuing to discredit our parliaments in the eyes of thousands of members of the public who are calling for a halt to inequality, to injustice and to a Fortress Europe policy.
For these reasons, we will be voting against this report, which overlooks all these facts and fails to offer any alternative.
Instead, we should act together, as a matter of urgency, to find concrete and equitable solutions to all these dramatic situations, and in particular to the sufferings of the refugees at Sangatte, and to the cries of distress from all those who come to Europe seeking asylum and help.
The decision-making processes nowadays concerning the police, the military, criminal law, Schengen and border controls are reminiscent, if anything, of a kind of political bodysnatching.
Today' s report on crossing external borders and the development of Schengen cooperation and yesterday' s proposal from the Commission are really two sides of the same coin.
As a Danish professor of criminal law expressed it very clearly yesterday, the alarming thing is that 'the EU Commission and other institutions are merely using the attacks in the United States as an opportunity to promote far-reaching harmonisation, and harmonisation means that the national traditions of criminal law, criminal procedure and police investigation are eliminated in favour of arrangements adopted in more or less of a panic that make controls more stringent and damage civic rights' .
He also says: 'Politicians feel they must demonstrate their power to take action, but there is no point at all in harmonising criminal legislation in the EU.
That will not, in any case, reduce the number of terrorist acts by so much as one.'
That was the message.
Today' s report will quickly be overtaken by events which take place long after the report has seen the light of day.
The question underlying every political decision is that of whether we are thereby advancing our aims and, secondly, that of whether the means employed will compromise these aims.
I am afraid that the answer to the first question is: 'No, we shall not achieve the declared aims' , and that all experience goes to show that the answer to the second question, of whether the means will compromise the ends, is unfortunately 'yes' .
The controls will be harmful, and anyone who cares to read the Supervisory Board' s report for 1998-99 and subsequent statements on the lack of supervision of the Schengen authorities will acknowledge that I am right.

Mr President, Commissioner, illegal immigration is a daily phenomenon at all of the European Union' s borders, affecting certain regions with particular intensity and with an enormous humanitarian, social and economic impact.
Please allow me to focus on those border regions of the Union which, like Andalusia, most vividly experience the arrival of dozens of people each day.
Andalusia, owing to its geographical proximity to the Maghreb, is enduring great migratory pressure without having the appropriate instruments for confronting it.
The Spanish administration has publicly acknowledged that the situation is unsustainable and, furthermore, bilateral relations with the Maghreb and the Kingdom of Morocco are difficult at the moment due to problems related to fishing, drug-trafficking and illegal immigration itself.
Some of us have been arguing for years that, within the framework of the Schengen Agreement, the special status of border regions such as Andalusia should be recognised and that these areas of the European Union should be provided with instruments which would allow them to deal with the arrival of these immigrants more effectively.
They should also be given the power to propose measures to the central government and to the European Union relating to work, residence and the necessary social integration of people who are forced to emigrate across the Straits of Gibraltar to reception regions such as Andalusia.
Mr President, first of all, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to congratulate Parliament and its rapporteur on their detailed work.
This report on crossing external borders and the development of Schengen cooperation touches on a subject at the very heart of the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice.
In fact Schengen is a rather special animal.
On the one hand it guarantees freedom of movement, which is a key part of the Treaty, and on the other hand it responds to the need to encompass this freedom within a solid and coherent policy of external border controls and other compensatory measures.
However, the integration of Schengen into the EU framework in practice marked the end of that agreement, although it lives on as a symbol.
Schengen was created as a kind of test laboratory for the implementation of the absolute obligation laid down in the Single European Act.
Schengen has subsequently been divided up and integrated into the framework of the Union, and the legislative provisions of the Community and of the Union are gradually replacing and developing the Schengen Convention and other decisions relating to it.
By way of example, the joint manual and joint consular instructions have become regulations, and new proposals under the third pillar complement or replace the equivalent provisions of the Schengen Convention, which have been assigned to this pillar.
Furthermore, in July the Commission submitted to the Council and Parliament a proposal bringing together in a single legal instrument the five categories of persons who can move freely within an uncontrolled area, thus following up the wish expressed by the European Parliament to bring together the various disparate provisions governing the movement of persons.
The Commission accordingly intends to bring forward a proposal relating to Article 2 of the Schengen Protocol, so as to better encompass the safeguard clause on the reintroduction of internal border controls.
This work has not been completed, but the objective is to 'Amsterdamise' Schengen in the near future.
Mr President, that is why I think it would be difficult to embark upon an exercise which would involve regular reports on Schengen, because these would end up being reports on the various instruments that have replaced or are in the process of replacing Schengen.
But I can commit the Commission to continuing to keep Parliament regularly informed of developments in this field, which for the sake of semantic convenience we will call Schengen.
Furthermore, Parliament is kept informed of overall legislative and practical activity by means of the scoreboard created following the Tampere Council, which is regularly updated.
The Commission considered that the conversion of the Schengen acquis should be based on priority needs depending on the development of the situation and political guidance from the Council and Parliament.
One of these priorities is of course the development of the Schengen Information System, and of course also, and this will be of great interest to you, issues relating to the candidate countries.
The rapporteur has taken these concerns on board and the Commission certainly shares them.
I would like to give you some information on the most recent developments concerning the Schengen Information System, SIS II.
As you know, the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 28 and 29 May did not reach unanimous agreement on intergovernmental finance.
It was therefore agreed to provide financing from the Community budget.
Furthermore, the Belgian Presidency and Sweden presented two initiatives, one on the first pillar and the other on the third pillar, with a view to giving the Commission, assisted by a committee, responsibility for developing SIS II between 2002 and 2006.
The key objective of these two proposals, which are currently being considered by the Council, is first of all to provide a legal basis for the financing of this stage of development.
Secondly, legislative proposals are to be presented on the various key aspects of SIS II, in particular the issue of management and functionality.
In the context of its responsibility for financing, the Commission will also present a communication covering the various aspects of SIS II, that is to say legal, technical and financial issues, but also the various preparatory stages needed, and also the general method to be adopted until SIS II is finally established.
Mr President, Mr Coelho, I wish to conclude by assuring you that your resolution will be taken into account by the Commission in assessing the efforts already made and those that remain to be made and in defining its priorities for action in the Schengen field.
Many thanks, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
Refugee status in Member States
The next item is the report (A5-0291/2001) by Mr Watson, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status.
Mr President, I have the honour to have my name attached to this report but most of the work has been done by my Christian Democrat colleague, Mr Ingo Schmitt, who took this report through committee.
Due to the result of the vote, he chose not to pursue it by introducing it in plenary and I am doing so on behalf of my committee.
The Commission has proposed a Council directive on minimum standards for procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status.
The Commission has come forward with proposals for a number of rules on the handling of asylum applications.
This is very much a first step towards the common asylum system which the Commission has proposed and which this House has on many occasions supported.
These rules cover reception and detention facilities, the content of refugee status and the application process.
They designate time limits for applications and appeals and they introduce specific rules for dealing with inadmissible cases.
It is my honour to present on behalf of the committee a number of amendments to these proposals.
We recognise that these amendments are not binding but we hope that they will be considered carefully and taken on board in policy formulation.
Our amendments seek to clarify and strengthen the position of asylum seekers.
We aim to ensure due respect for the Geneva Convention and its protocols and for the European Convention on Human Rights when dealing with applications for asylum.
We aim to secure for asylum seekers the right to remain on the territory of a Member State until their appeal has been decided.
We recommend special attention be paid to the cases of applications from women and children who have been particularly vulnerable to abuse and attack in the countries from which they flee.
We seek to improve access to legal assistance for those seeking asylum and to emphasise that asylum seekers should not be sent back to places where their lives might be in danger.
As a general rule, we reject or resist the practice of holding asylum seekers in detention centres.
I for one welcome the recent United Kingdom court ruling against the UK government's practice of locking asylum seekers in detention centres, however modern those centres may be.
We believe that asylum seekers who are often escaping persecution of the worst kind in their homelands have the right to be treated with dignity when they reach our shores.
We understand the pressures on Member States but we reject the creeping tendency we see towards a dilution of the rights of asylum seekers.
We believe that the determination of refugee status must remain a legal matter and not a matter of politics or one of political expediency.
The health of a society is judged not only by its practices but also by the direction in which its face is set and my committee believes that the Commission's policy is taking us in the right direction even if we seek greater clarity in the rights of some of those to whom it is directed.
It is not only a question of our legal and humanitarian obligations but also a question of economic and administrative common sense.
The more asylum seekers that a government rejects - perhaps in the hope of courting short-term popular support of the basest nature - the more appeals it will face, the more it will be tied down in lengthy processes which will hit the taxpayer in the pocket.
Our amendments seek to ensure not only administrative efficiency but also a humanitarian approach to the position of those on our planet who deserve our support and protection.
I hope the House will follow the line that has been put forward by the committee in this report.
Mr President, the Foreign Affairs Committee welcomes the changes made at the committee stage of this report, for as the common asylum and immigration policy of the EU develops, it is essential that its impact on the outside world and especially upon our close neighbours is fully taken into account.
These countries, many of them candidate states, are at the sharp end of the refugee problem.
Most of them have no experience of refugee and asylum policy.
They all lack the financial and human resources to deal competently with applications to stay.
The Foreign Affairs Committee also felt it was important to insert a reference to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, as well as the obligation to respect all existing international law commitments.
Finally, we have also insisted that the EU's new procedures should aim to contribute to the improvement of international relations by being as clear, transparent and reasoned as possible, so that their interpretation by third countries and their citizens will be facilitated.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, I believe that the Committee, which adopted this version of the report by a majority, is on the wrong track.
Let me explain briefly what I mean.
About a year ago, when the Commission submitted its working document, we attempted to reach a compromise on this very difficult and sensitive issue.
We agreed that we would distinguish between three specific groups: firstly, asylum seekers; secondly, persons who come to us on a temporary basis from crisis regions; and finally, people who wish to migrate to the Member States in order to make their lives here.
In particular, we all recognised that we could only regulate the last pillar, that is, immigration, sensibly by ensuring that the number - I am choosing my words carefully - of unfounded asylum applications can be reduced, at least that we can process them consistently.
We all know that no more than 10% or 15% of the applications submitted are genuinely well-founded and likely to be recognised under the Geneva Convention.
This is where the Committee and a majority of its members have made two errors, in my view: firstly, it has abandoned the consensus which we worked so hard to achieve and, secondly, it has done no service at all to genuine applicants who are politically persecuted, because it also treats everyone who enters Germany or another Member State without a well-founded claim in more or less the same way and thus undermines the standing of genuine applicants.
Expanding the rights of asylum to include new forms of (non-state) persecution, restricting the opportunities of Member States - at least those Member States which have to cope with large influxes - to make effective use of the 'safe country of origin' principle, but also the issue of how manifestly unfounded applications should be dealt with - indeed, the entire contents of this report - means that there is longer any way of taking effective action when large numbers of unfounded applications are made.
I appeal to you yet again!
I know this is a difficult issue.
I also know this is a sensitive issue.
However, let us try to uphold the details of these common pillars which we discussed a year ago, and where there was plenty of scope to reach a consensus.
I hope that the German Social Democrats - who adopt an entirely different tone in their dealings with their Home Affairs Minister in Germany - might change their voting behaviour today.
I also hope that we will again find a way of achieving consensus which will enhance the status of those who have genuinely suffered political persecution and seek asylum in the Member States.
Mr President, may I thank Mr Watson on behalf of our committee for bringing this report to plenary.
I listened carefully to what Mr Watson and Mr Schmitt just said.
Mr Schmitt spoke a lot about unjustified applications and, of course, we need to look at all applications properly.
Mr Schmitt said, and I wholeheartedly agree with him, that Member States have to do more to address the root causes that are forcing people to migrate across Europe and across the world, but it is not easy to address the root causes in the countries from where many asylum seekers come.
The highest number of asylum seekers in Europe come from Afghanistan, Iran and Sri Lanka and at the moment, as we know only too well, it will not be easy to address quickly the situation in Afghanistan: we watch that situation with some terror.
Nearer to home, we are affected, at the moment by the lack of a common working asylum system for Europe and the separate issue of a common immigration policy, which will come later.
But we see on our television screens, certainly in Britain and France nightly, and colleagues in Spain have a similar problem, the way that the lack of a proper system manifests itself in tragedy.
Asylum seekers are desperate people escaping in many cases war, violence and torture.
Yes, Mr Schmitt, some of them are just escaping poverty, but we should not knock them for that.
We need to give them respect and make certain that they are treated fairly.
This report calls for high standards for reception of asylum seekers, to recognise that they are not criminals while their cases are being heard.
People escaping from the worst situations do not need to be detained in prisons, detention centres and I agree with Mr Watson on this.
Those escaping from war and torture do not need to be welcomed by barbed wire and armed guards.
They need to have their cases heard properly, they need a fair system and they need a system that puts the individual at the heart of the process.
This report goes some way towards that, but it is part of a much wider picture working towards a common European asylum system with a separate immigration system alongside it.
I hope that we can get this through as amended and continue the vast amount of work still to be done in this area.
Welcome
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure to inform you that a delegation from the People' s National Congress of China is seated in the official gallery.
This delegation is led by Mrs Li Shu-Zheng, Vice-Chair of the Committee for Foreign Affairs of the People' s National Congress of the People' s Republic of China.
Mrs Li Shu-Zheng is accompanied by seven members of the People' s National Congress and by several high-level representatives from the Department for Foreign Affairs of the People' s National Congress of China.
I warmly welcome the Chinese delegation, which has been participating in the 18th interparliamentary meeting between the European Parliament and China.
This meeting took place on 17 and 18 September 2001. It gave rise to various bilateral meetings with the chairmen of the political groups and of the committees, and to a meeting with our President, Mrs Fontaine.
The dialogue between the European Parliament and the People' s National Congress of China has developed over time and now covers a wide range of issues.
We wish to see a permanent deepening of this dialogue combined with the strengthening of our cooperation with the People' s Republic of China.
Refugee status in Member States (continuation)
Madam President, the objective of this important report is to produce an asylum system that is fair: fair on asylum seekers, but fair on taxpayers too.
This report is not about who you should accept as a refugee, and I remind Mr Schmitt of that, but about how you decide which claims are valid.
It is a great fallacy to assume that if you give asylum seekers less help in making their claims, they will somehow disappear and cost less time and money.
Governments in search of populist headlines about the number of applications rejected from so-called bogus asylum seekers should tell the truth.
The truth is that cutting corners early on in the procedure ends up costing a lot more in administration, court time, lawyers and the cost of food and shelter.
I fear that Mr Schmitt did not understand this truth and has somehow misled Members of his group.
I appeal therefore to those moderate Members of the Conservative/Christian Democrat Group to join the majority in this Parliament in strengthening the guarantees in the asylum procedure, because investment in high quality initial decisions including such matters as assistance with interpretation, legal advice, proper interviews and reasonable time limits, is a good bargain.
Then on the question of fair treatment I would like to stress in particular the use of the safe third country concept.
My group accepts the use of this concept as a guidance, but it must be one which is capable of being rebutted in an individual case.
It is perfectly fair that an asylum seeker from, say, Canada, will have a greater job convincing the authorities that asylum is justified, compared to someone coming for example from Iraq.
But it should be possible to make that case through individual assessment, not with a blanket dismissal of the claim.
Madam President, we have heard a great deal over the last few days about some of the values which we hold dear, especially those of democracy and freedom.
I would like to add: humanity, respect for human rights and equality before the law.
So, within that context, I welcome much of the report now presented by Mr Watson: That perspective however, also explains why my group will not be supporting amendments proposed by the PPE-DE Group which we rejected in committee and which we believe seek to restrict the rights of asylum seekers.
I particularly welcome some of the amendments proposed by the committee, which state that the right to refugee status should be recognised rather than granted: refugee status is a legal right, not the gift of a benevolent regime.
I also welcome the recognition that there are forms of persecution which are not included in the Geneva Convention.
We debated such an issue in this House only last night, that of female genital mutilation.
My group believes that we should be building on the Geneva Convention and that hopefully a common asylum policy will eventually do that.
We also welcome the fact that the gender dimension is now recognised in this report.
We also welcome the recognition of the need for the interviewing and assessment process for asylum applications to take place in the applicant's own language.
This is crucial as the outcome of such procedures can literally be a matter of life or death for the applicant.
How can we expect an individual who has suffered torture, humiliation or sexual degradation to express that in a language in which they can just get by.
My group, however, rejects the concept of a safe third country.
When we look at the huge variation between Members States of what they view as safe we can see the problems raised by this concept, especially taking new forms of persecution into account.
As Baroness Ludford has said, every application must be dealt with on its own merits.
We need the highest standards possible, and in that respect, this report has made substantial improvements.
Madam President, the pictures we have seen in recent days from Afghanistan are of course clear evidence that the problem does not go away but that the flow of refugees unfortunately continues as a direct result of the policy we are pursuing here in our part of the world.
I hear quite a few people talking about a common European asylum policy.
Indeed, that might well be a very sensible idea, but I want, for my part, to say that the prerequisite for my being able to support it is that it should be a sound policy.
The rapporteur originally tried to word this report in such a way that it restricted asylum seekers' rights and opportunities in our countries.
What the committee finally agreed upon was to require that we should end up with a policy which, if anything, amounted to the status quo.
I think it would be a good thing if the European Parliament could send out a clear signal now that, if there is to be a common asylum policy in the EU, it must in no circumstances be a policy that provides asylum seekers with poorer conditions than those under which they are at present living in the Member States.
I very much hope that the result of the vote we are to hold this afternoon will be to send out such a signal.
Madam President, Europe is running two risks.
One is that we are erecting a 'fortress Europe' where foreigners are no longer welcome and where we do not take the slightest notice of the rest of the world.
That is not what we want, nor is it in line with international obligations.
The EU Member States must look after refugees, and not only refugees at their own backdoor, but also refugees elsewhere.
Although the Commission' s proposal is not related to this, I still believe it is necessary to draw attention to the many refugees in camps.
They too deserve support and attention, often more than they are receiving now.
That is why the UNHCR must be given a huge financial boost.
No fortress Europe, therefore, but there is also another risk.
That is that Europe might be turning into a kind of playground to which almost everyone can gain easy access to enjoy the many benefits it has to offer.
That is not want we want either.
It places too heavy a burden on the facilities of the European states.
In this day and age, when evidently many find the money and the means to come to Europe and seek asylum, asylum procedures must be strict and straightforward.
Otherwise, life in the refugee camps will be in even starker contrast to this ideal.
The Commission proposal is now a sober and realistic document which generally strikes the right balance between straightforward procedures and the rule of law.
However, the amendments tabled by this Parliament with regard to the Commission document often lack the necessary balance.
That is why I cannot support the majority of these.
Madam President, the proposal for a Council directive on procedures for granting refugee status, which, as defined in the Treaty, is supposed to be binding on the Member States as regards the outcome to be achieved, whilst leaving it to the national authorities to decide what procedures and means to employ, is in fact an extremely nit-picking document.
For example, it goes into inordinate length and detail on the definition of an unfounded application for asylum, in Article 28, of a safe third country, in Article 22 and in Annex I, and of a safe country of origin, in Annex II.
As if the Member States were babes in arms and as if their officials had never processed a single application for asylum in their lives.
But what is most extraordinary of all is that this proposal manages to be both nit-picking and lax at the same time.
Because there are not many provisions motivated by the concern to grant so-called high-level guarantees to asylum seekers that are not also - and we must not overlook this point - low-level guarantees for the citizens of Member States.
Let me quote just one example amongst many, Article 25, which stipulates that if the applicant's declarations are not proven but appear simply to be probable, he should be given the benefit of the doubt.
This may seem to be a generous gesture in principle and indeed it is, but in the context of the troubled times in which we find ourselves today it fails to take account of other interests at stake, and above all those of the European public.
That is why we believe that the text before us today should just be the first part of the final directive.
Following this first part, which is devoted to the protection of asylum-seekers, a second part needs to be written, which will be devoted to the protection of the European public, who at best will foot the bill for this policy and at worst will be the victims of it. I say that because we should not forget that at least three-quarters of applications for asylum submitted nowadays ultimately turn out to be unfounded.
And please do not tell us, Commissioner, that those texts will follow later.
They should be presented to us at the same time so that we can take an overall view.
Having said that, I can scarcely bring myself to mention the amendments proposed in the report from the relevant committee of the European Parliament.
I will come back to those in my explanation of vote. Let me just say at this stage that they are so rash that in the end the rapporteur himself ended up resigning and having to be replaced in fairly disastrous circumstances.
All these texts, both the directive and the amendments, remind us, against the background of our recent debates on security, that it is extremely unhealthy in times like these to authorise 400 000 to 500 000 asylum-seekers a year to enter our territory, given that the majority will ultimately be turned down, but as they are not expelled, will remain on a semi-clandestine basis.
This floating, unchecked population is growing every year and adding to other sources of clandestine immigration.
We believe, Madam President, having seen the documents before us today, that the European institutions are still a long way from giving priority to the public' s safety.
Madam President, Commissioner, we are being asked to express our views on a subject which in itself involves a very broad spectrum of activities.
It is easy to talk about the right to asylum pure and simple, holding it up as a sacred principle, and it is all the more clearly sacred at this sensitive moment when the world is shaken by such dramatic events; solidarity and goodwill are the feelings that we all, in our bewilderment, feel we want to appeal to so that we can build new, better structures between people, worlds and cultures.
It is also clear, however, that, right now, we must not deviate from the objective of achieving tangible situations and establishing practical prospects that are closely linked to reality.
In the proposal for a directive, as Mr Schmitt has already mentioned, there are some - in our view - complex concepts that conflict with the direction we had embarked on in our work last year and open up certain political problems that, in our opinion, are quite serious.
Is it right, for instance, to accept that a third country that is considered safe should always be so regardless of the tangible fact that links it to the asylum seeker?
Or that a manifestly unfounded application should, even so, always give rise to a complicated, expensive verification procedure?
It goes without saying that certainty on this is in the clear interests both of those who have serious grounds for seeking protection and of the host country itself.
I do not want to go into the legal and philosophical concept of what constitutes being manifestly unfounded, but on matters which are now more sensitive than ever such as that addressed by the Watson report, we must show our determination to build without putting up obstacles, and to help without negative or even destructive effects on our social systems.
Therefore, when we look at the wording on the extension of the right to asylum, the fast-track procedure and the appeals procedure, I think that, on careful analysis, my doubts will be widely shared.
Madam President, I feel compelled to respond to the things that have been said in this House with regard to the position of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on this issue.
Mr Schmitt, there is absolute agreement in my group that the three different groups of people arriving in the Union should be dealt with differently.
So much so that we supported the Wiebenga report with regard to the first group that you mentioned, with a view to creating regulations on reception for temporary refugees, who come in massive numbers fleeing from conflict, which is something the European Peoples' Party did not do.
With regard to asylum and refuge, we agree that we should treat asylum seekers as a group of people seeking protection and who want to enter for humanitarian reasons on an equal basis with those seeking reunification with their families.
The problem is, Mr Schmitt, that my group cannot renounce, despite what you claim Mr Shily, the German Interior Minister, says, the idea that refugees are individuals and that each case must be treated individually in accordance with personal circumstances and not nationality, as well as the safe non-EU country they have reached, for example.
A non-EU country may be safe for one individual but not for another, but do not force me to give examples, since these are always odious.
We cannot relinquish this idea and furthermore, at a time when the European Union is going to produce the first harmonised legislation on refugees, we want to send a clear signal that we are in favour of this common legislation but not in order to reduce levels of protection and rights of asylum seekers, a field in which the European Union has been an historic example and has greatly assisted organisations such as the UNHCR and others.
With regard to the issue of asylum and immigration, there is no doubt that we agree that immigrants are not refugees.
But the problem is that we lack the courage to create clear immigration laws, which would allow the legal entry of people which our society and our labour market can absorb, without destroying the asylum system in the process, which has been the only open door for many years.
We are in absolute agreement on this.
This is our position and it seems very clear to me.
Madam President, I want to thank the committee and its chairman for a well-considered report.
The increasing flow of refugees in recent years shows the need for a common refugee policy both within the EU and globally.
The various Member States' more or less panicky reactions faced with people' s desire to find sanctuary and a new life in Europe have struck a very discordant note, given the humanitarian values the EU stands for.
There have been many tragedies on the EU' s borders, involving vessels that have gone down, desperate refugees who have hidden in containers and refugees who have tried to swim their way to Europe.
On many occasions, I have felt depressed by quite a few of the proposals from the Member States and the Commission whose main aim seems to have been to stop, impede, deport and expel.
Those who have spoken of an EU that is developing into a fortress Europe are, unfortunately, not completely mistaken.

Against this background, this proposal for a directive is along the right lines. The rights of the individual are emphasised, and repressive measures do not dominate.
It is certainly true that common asylum rules are needed within the EU, but there also needs to be scope for individual Member States to make more generous assessments.
The committee has guaranteed this scope.
The committee also strengthens the rights of the individual under the Geneva Convention in relation to the position of children, the ability to hold refugees in custody, greater knowledge on the part of those who have to deal with matters relating to refugees and reasonable periods within which applications are to be processed. Quite simply, it is a question of increased legal certainty.
I am nonetheless a little uneasy about the Council' s future handling of these issues.
We must safeguard the absolute requirement under the Geneva Convention that every refugee shall have his case examined individually, just as Baroness Ludford said.
As I see it, there are no safe countries.
If, as Europeans, we are not completely to forfeit our good name, a different refugee policy based upon respect, openness and legal certainty is required.
It is not countries such as Nauru that can be expected to assume responsibility for people fleeing from barbaric regimes such as that in Afghanistan.
Empathy and humanitarianism are required even more now, a week after the tragedy in the United States.
Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to the clarity of the proposals contained in Mr Watson' s report on the granting of refugee status.
I feel that he has succeeded in reconciling various points of view.
I personally see this report as complementing both the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Geneva Convention.
As the Commission wanted, I believe that we finally have a good basis for discussion.
We all know that there was a very wide disparity between the various Member States' approaches to accepting refugees.
We also know that the steps involved were complex and difficult.
This report enables us to go somewhat further.
And it also enhances the aid and support that we can give to refugees.
I am also satisfied that our committee has taken into account the new forms that persecution can take. A few decades ago we were welcoming Chilean and Soviet refugees fleeing from dictatorships and persecution at the hands of their own governments.
Nowadays there are certainly forms of repression, which force us to change our mindset and to take into account practices such as the sexual and genital mutilation of women, and new forms of persecution associated with terrorist groups and fundamentalists, and I believe that we have certainly taken that into consideration.
I would even go further and say that it is time that we considered asylum on health grounds bearing in mind that a disaster like AIDS is ravaging a continent, and similarly we should consider accepting child soldiers when they are at the mercy of arms dealers.
I believe that it is also important for this report to be adequate in terms of the fight against discrimination.
I shall conclude by saying that in recent weeks, in view of the terrifying attacks committed on the United States last week, the fear of attacks against Afghan civilians has become a real one.
At present, there are 600 people in the camp at Sangatte who are firmly committed to opposing terrorism.
They are asking to be accepted here.
I think that if we were able to accept them, this would not only be a way of breaking the perceived link between terrorism and Islam, but that these people would also be solid allies in the fight against terrorism.
Mr Watson, let me take the liberty of suggesting that we could ascribe that phrase from Camus to you, when he said that his revolt was also the revolt of others.
Thank you for your report.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council's proposal offers refugees an opportunity to acquire refugee status under the Geneva Convention in accordance with uniform criteria which will apply throughout the European Union.
This proposal guarantees rapid and reliable procedures for genuine refugees - who account for around 10% of all those who apply for asylum - and also ensures that unsuccessful applications will be rejected quickly.
This applies to around 90% of asylum seekers who apply for reasons other than genuine persecution. That is better than being forced to wait for years before being informed of a negative decision.
This proposal also puts an end to 'asylum shopping' .
However, we also need supplementary measures.
These include the Dublin Convention, Eurodac, and rules on safe third countries and safe countries of origin.
The European People' s Party therefore supports the Council's proposal.
However, on behalf of the PPE-DE, I should like to make it clear that asylum law must not now be exploited for political purposes through all the amendments and proposals put forward here and used as a pretext for immigration on many different grounds.
This ignores the reality.
We must use these new European instruments for immigration, asylum or short-term help when refugees come from war-torn regions.
We must not adopt any unrealistic measures.
In future, it must be guaranteed that the right of asylum will be reserved for those who are politically persecuted and will not be extended to groups who some people might want to bring here for political reasons but who do not comply with the provisions of the Geneva Convention.
Our aim must be to guarantee reliable and prompt support for genuine refugees, as well as follow-up measures to assist them with integration. At the same time, we must make it clear to everyone else that there will be other new instruments governing economic immigration into the European Union.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, particularly in light of recent events, today's debate - which I believe we are conducting in a genuinely objective way - is a good example to other parliaments.
It is extremely necessary, but because it is necessary, it is also very difficult.
Sadly, we now have to begin yet again to dismantle prejudices against people seeking asylum.
These prejudices result from fears which are largely unjustified but which must nonetheless be taken seriously.
Now in particular, I think it is important that we no longer engage in lengthy speech-making but take action.
I believe that those people who, in the wake of the recent outrages, shouted for the military to intervene must admit that as politicians, we bear responsibility now more than ever and that we must prove that we are not responding in blind panic but are capable of acting responsibly to deal with the difficulties we face.
For this reason - and I say this to the Members on the Conservative benches - we are not acting as if we are in fundamental agreement with Mr Schmitt or Mr Pirker because we like them as individuals.
There are reasons why we are changing our voting behaviour and voting differently from our group on a number of amendments.
The background is as follows: although we are delighted that the Party of European Socialists in this House is doing everything possible to grant refugees more protection and rights, which we greatly welcome, we have a problem as German Social Democrats.
We cannot accept an agreement or decision if it does not conform with the German constitution.
At present, the German Basic Law does not permit us to accept around 17 of the proposed amendments.
For this reason, we have to adopt a different voting behaviour from our group on a number of these amendments.
This does not imply that we have different objectives.
Our objectives are the same.
However, we have to consider the credibility of our policies in Germany.
We cannot disappoint our citizens and accept a decision which is impossible to implement at home.
This is why we will be adopting a different voting behaviour today.
Madam President, Commissioner, in a situation in which the outrages in the USA have been used by some people as a pretext to incite antipathy towards asylum seekers, it is especially important for the European Union to devise minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status which are based on respect for human rights.
The Commission's proposal meets this requirement.
I particularly welcome two provisions proposed by the Commission.
Article 3(3) states that Member States may decide to apply the provisions of this Directive to procedures for deciding on applications for kinds of protection other than that emanating from the Geneva Convention for persons who are found not to be refugees.
This means that persons fleeing from fundamentalist violence - as in Algeria - or rape victims can be granted asylum. The UNHCR has been calling for this provision for some time.
Unfortunately, it has not yet been adopted in practice in my own country, for example. Annex 1 sets forth the three criteria which must be met for a country to be defined as a safe third country.
If these criteria are applied in future, some of the deportations from EU countries will no longer be permitted.
I am pleased that the Commission's acceptable proposal has been improved by the Committee responsible and not watered down as the original rapporteur Mr Schmitt intended.
As it now stands, the Directive is an important step towards a more humane asylum policy in the European Union.
Madam President, this is the first in a series of directives that have to complete the first part of the timetable which aims to introduce, in the longer term, a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for people who are granted asylum.
That is the spirit, and also the letter, of the Tampere agreements and the Treaty of Amsterdam, although we should discuss the legal basis of the common asylum procedure and uniform status.
I would very briefly like to mention to the Commission certain reservations of a technical nature that arise as a result of the proposed directive we are analysing.
The first relates to the extension of the minimum rules for asylum procedures.
I believe that the proposal puts excessive stress on regulation and that a common asylum procedure is never intended to be a single procedure or the same procedure for all States.
I am afraid that the Commission may have gone beyond what was agreed at Tampere.
The second reservation relates to the Commission' s interest in regulating time limits, because I am wondering: is a long procedure a factor in the rejection of asylum seekers?
That does not mean that we are in favour of a long procedure.
However, from a practical point of view, European countries with long waiting times - more than two or three years - have greater numbers of asylum seekers, and countries such as Spain, with much shorter waiting times, have far fewer.
Harmonisation of these waiting times is acceptable if it is due to a concern for the legal correctness of the procedure, but I fear that it may be inefficient and instil fear for both material and political reasons.
The third and final reservation is of a conceptual nature.
I believe that the difficulties in homogenising decisions stem more from the definition of a refugee than from the procedure for identifying one as such.
Concepts such as 'safe third country' , 'third party persecution' , 'persecution in the event of conflict' or 'state or non-state persecution' are examples of some of these problems.
Perhaps, as I said before, we should deal with the definition before the procedure.
Madam President, I would like to remind the House of the importance of the proposal we are debating today, for various reasons.
Firstly, I believe we should make it very clear that this is a very important first step towards a common European asylum system which, in the long term, will be valid throughout the Union.
Secondly, I believe that we must not now forget that what we are doing is no less than fulfilling one of the objectives agreed at the Tampere European Council, where respect for the right to asylum was reaffirmed in a completely unconditional way.
Thirdly, despite possible discrepancies between parliamentary groups on certain points of the proposal we debated, we must not forget that, in reality, we are providing all the European national systems with a structure that may operate efficiently in accordance with the Geneva Convention on the status of refugees.
I believe that the European Union, from this Parliament, cannot look the other way and fail to implement the instruments that Europe is developing at this moment.
We must remember the Charter of Fundamental Rights which this House recently approved and that, if it is to be borne in mind in this particular field, it must always be with a view to implementing that which was agreed in the Geneva Convention and never to reduce it.
For one reality we cannot forget is that, since the second half of 1996, the number of asylum seekers in the European Union has increased considerably, while the resolutions which recognise and grant that right have diminished alarmingly.
For all these reasons I believe that the amendments that we have adopted in committee and which we are presenting to Parliament today have substantially improved the Council' s proposal and have highlighted certain very interesting questions, especially with regard to the safeguards for asylum seekers, the principle of non-return and also certain essential minimum requirements throughout the process of taking decisions on the recognition of this status, which require that each case be studied individually.
These asylum requests cannot be resolved collectively.
Despite the Commission' s misgivings, I believe that we will have taken a great step forward with these amendments, if they are also adopted today in Parliament.

Madam President, I am sorry to have to begin by saying that this proposal is highly disappointing for several reasons, as is the debate that we have had so far, with rare exceptions. Some speakers have shown that they are not quite aware of the limits between humanitarianism and permissiveness or between necessary controls and unnecessary torture, but, above all, many have shown they do not understand that laws are not made of rubber - they are not as elastic as some would like, that is - but they have certain fixed points, certain cornerstones, beyond which one cannot go.
The reason why I think this document should be rejected is that it is not balanced.
It all too clearly favours the position of the asylum seeker, exaggerating the values I have just summarised, and places the Member States and competent bodies in a really difficult position to make a serious assessment of asylum seekers' applications.
Another reason is that this seems to be a purely theoretical text, clearly divorced from the reality on which it is necessarily and inevitably based: the everyday reality of countries - particularly (but not only) my own, Italy - that have to grapple with the problem of uncontrolled immigration on a daily basis.
Another reason for rejecting this type of formulation also derives from the lack of uniformity in the assessments made by Member States in their procedures for granting refugee status.
One can thus find cases of secondary migration; that is, refugees enter via the most permissive State and then transfer or move on internally to another, more restrictive State.
The proposal is not even clear on the distinction between the three different groups of asylum seekers either: those suffering political persecution as defined in the Geneva Convention, which has already been mentioned; refugees from war zones; and economic and occupational immigrants.
It is unacceptable that three categories of asylum seekers that are so different from each other should be dealt with under the same rules.
The Commission, furthermore, seems even to want to streamline the asylum acceptance procedure, extending it also to people whose cases do not come within the spirit of the Geneva Convention or the openings of the Tampere Council or even the updates on this issue to Title IV of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
What makes the Commission' s proposal and also the Parliamentary Committee' s draft legislation inadequate is that they do not correspond to reality.
An ordinary piece of legislation is proposed for a severe emergency situation.
Come and see what has been happening every day for the last ten years along the Italian coastline; come and see the conditions under which we are working to receive the people, not to put them in prison, and you will realise how inadequate these proposed guidelines are.
As I said at the beginning, here we must not confuse humanitarianism with strictness: the two things can go together.
If you think that 300-400 refugees arrive in Italy every day, 1000 yesterday alone, you will realise that certain precautions are necessary or even inevitable.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, there is no need for long laments of pity such as I heard just now.
There are no cases of inhuman treatment, nobody is held in temporary prisons; the refugees are received and fed, and then they are identified and classified to sort out the illegal immigrants among them, who are rejected, from the genuine ones, who are helped to stay, and also to try to identify underworld infiltrators.
There it is, then: strictness, yes; permissiveness, no.
That is why our group will support all of Mr Schmitt' s amendments that aim to restore the original text of the report, that which lays down fairer rules, especially for the Member States that find themselves in this difficult situation.
In short, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen: once they have got through the door into Italy, thanks to Schengen you will find all kinds, genuine ones and unwelcome ones, in your own countries.
I shall give the floor to Commissioner Reding to wind up the debate on Mr Watson' s report.
Commissioner, rather unusually, we have a little time at our disposal, so if you would like to take advantage of that, we will be pleased to hear what you have to say.
Thank you, Madam President.
I have to say that having been a Member of the European Parliament myself for ten years, it is little short of a miracle to hear you say that I have time to speak!
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission very much welcomes the in-depth consideration that Parliament has given to this proposal.
I would like to tell Mr Watson how much we have appreciated his work.
Furthermore, the number and quality of the amendments are bound to add to the debate, and this comes at a crucial point in the process of creating a common policy on asylum.
I would first like to put this proposal in its proper overall context.
The Tampere European Council actually wanted to create a common European asylum system and it agreed on a two-phase approach to achieve this.
Firstly, the adoption of minimum common standards in the areas laid down in Article 63 of the Treaty, and then the development of a common procedure and uniform status for persons under international protection.
The achievement of the first phase was dependent on the Commission adopting a certain number of legislative initiatives, which did indeed take place with the adoption on 12 September of a proposal for a directive on determining the status and forms of subsidiary protection.
So this cycle is now complete.
Furthermore, in its communication of November 2000, on which this House, Madam President, will give its opinion on 2 October, the Commission proposed moving on to the second phase by means of a special methodology.
Its intention is to present this methodology in this communication and to draw lessons from the first year's work, and it will make proposals for new directions in the run-up to the Laeken European Council.
The proposal that we are discussing today is one of the most important and most sensitive aspects of this system.
It was prepared chiefly on the basis of information drawn from a wide-ranging consultation process based on a working document presented in March 1999.
The European Parliament had an opportunity to give its views in June 2000 and the Commission took on board many of the recommendations brought forward at that time.
Madam President, today' s resolution comes at a turning point in work in this area.
I say that because the Belgian Presidency, with the support of the Commission, intends to use the coming months to make significant progress on asylum matters.
This dossier, like immigration in general, should be one of the key aspects of the interim balance sheet of the implementation of the Tampere decisions and will therefore be prepared by the European Council by the end of this year.
Against this background, the Council of Ministers is due to hold an exploratory debate on 27 and 28 September and the outcome of that debate will determine how ambitious we are in our overall approach in this area.
We need to remember that our objective is to approximate national arrangements on procedures.
I would add that this work will also extend to the two other proposals, one on reception conditions for asylum-seekers and the other on the determination of the Member State responsible for examining an application for asylum.
What is more, these three texts are interlinked.
They need to be seen as a whole and I believe in fact that this House has always seen things in that light.
I would like to take the liberty of encouraging the European Parliament to give its opinion on these two other initiatives as quickly as possible.
With particular reference to procedures, there is no denying that there is a great disparity in a number of key areas.
And I do not believe that that should come as a surprise to us, because this initiative deals with a great many technically complex issues, which in itself is not so difficult, but they are also politically sensitive, which in the present political climate is a real problem.
Furthermore, the Council' s technical bodies have not yet completed the first reading, which means that the Member States' delegations have not yet had an opportunity to express their views on certain key provisions.
This is one of the reasons, Madam President, why it is difficult at this stage to comment in a definite way on this House' s amendments on appeal procedures, because we are still waiting for the Council to analyse and examine this issue.
Lastly, the discussions in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the content of the excellent draft legislative resolution presented by Mr Watson confirm the feeling that there is at present a clear divergence - as you know and as was evident this morning - between the expectations of the European Parliament and the capacity of the Council to reach unanimous agreement.
So the Commission is to some extent between two stools, as it were, but it intends to take on board your opinion, and the guidelines that may emerge from the discussions at ministerial level, as a basis for preparing an amended proposal so as to facilitate a possible consensus.
In this context it seems vital to maintain the balance sought in the original proposal between, on the one hand, the desire to consolidate the rights of asylum-seekers, with due respect for international instruments, and in particular the Geneva Convention, and, on the other hand, the need for efficient and swift procedures and the need to achieve a degree of convergence so as to prevent 'asylum shopping' .
That is why, and I wish to repeat this and make it very clear to your rapporteur, the Commission has a great deal of sympathy for the general approach that emerges from the draft legislative resolution.
However, it will not be possible for the Commission to adopt some of the suggestions made in that resolution which would undermine the achievement of these dual aims, and which would ultimately undermine the adoption of a text which we all wholeheartedly wish to see.
For example, the distinction between the normal procedure and the accelerated procedure, which is actually practised, in theory at least, in the Member States is a cornerstone of this.
If we were to accept the amendments seeking to eliminate this, this would involve seriously compromising the chances of getting the proposal adopted.
On the other hand, Mr Watson, the Commission is certainly ready to take into account either the spirit or the letter of certain amendments that aim to improve the applicant' s protection without undermining the fundamental distinction, which I mentioned earlier.
By the same token, the Commission shares the concerns reflected in various amendments which seek to further improve the quality of decisions made, whilst enhancing the situation of applicants and aiming to improve the efficiency of the national authorities which implement the procedures.
Nevertheless, the legislative route is not necessarily the best way of achieving such an objective, which in many cases may be done by improving and approximating administrative practices.
It is more likely that these standards will be achieved by implementing other means of cooperation, such as the open cooperation method which the Commission will in coming weeks be proposing should be extended to asylum matters.
Furthermore, certain of the amendments would fit better into your resolutions on the communitarisation of the Dublin Convention and on the definition of refugees to which I drew your attention just now.
Other proposals will have to be taken into consideration.
The Commission is accordingly in favour of strengthening the connection between this directive and international or European human rights instruments.
In particular, compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union needs to be clearly stated and guaranteed.
Similarly, it is important to be aware of the effect of adopting a text of this kind in the context of enlargement, and of its impact as regards updating the international protection agenda.
I have in mind in particular the global consultation process launched by the United Nations High Commissioner' s Office for Refugees on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Convention.
Lastly, the Commission does of course agree with your desire to see a more systematic follow-up to the implementation of this directive.
A measure of this kind is indeed vital to support and speed up the changeover to the common procedure decided upon at Tampere as the ultimate objective for the European Union.
Madam President, to conclude, the Commission reiterates its appreciation of the quality of the draft legislative resolution before us today.
It agrees with the general spirit of this resolution, but must nevertheless clearly inform this House about the difficulties that exist.
We need to take account of the constraints on the preparation of our amended proposal, and, furthermore, we hope that the Laeken European Council will give the European Union the necessary impetus to finally put into practice the aspirations declared in 1999 at Tampere.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 10.55 a.m. until voting time and resumed at 11.00 a.m.)
Mr President, colleagues, I wanted to send you an e-mail about this, but unfortunately I cannot send e-mails at the moment.
I know that many of you have been experiencing particular difficulties with GroupWise.
Since the beginning of last week, other computer problems linked to the main computer system have been sorted out, but the GroupWise blockages have not yet been solved.
I am in constant contact with the LSU-MEP Help-Desk and hope to have more concrete information on the GroupWise situation later today.
The company responsible for the server has been brought in to help find the solution.
I also wanted to send another e-mail advising colleagues to be at the airport at least two hours before the departure of their flight.
This is because of long delays as a result of increased security checks.
I am sorry to have to make a point of order again about smoking in the workplace.
As I was about to make a speech on harassment at work during last night's plenary session, the people in the booth behind me were smoking with the door open.
I had an asthma attack just before I was due to speak.
That is a case of harassment at the workplace.
You are absolutely right.
Quite apart from your personal health problems, it is a matter of courtesy.
Neither Members nor anyone else should smoke anywhere other than in the designated smoking areas.

After adoption of the Commission proposal
Folias (PPE-DE), rapporteur.
(EL) Mr President, I understand that the Commission is to make a statement on my report and I should very much like to hear it.
Mr President, Mr Barnier was in contact yesterday with the Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control to explain to her the Commission' s position on this subject.
I can therefore assure you that while it will not accept the amendments proposed, the Commission will take the necessary steps to achieve the outcome sought by Parliament, and that when the amended regulation is adopted by the Council the Commission will make a statement in which it will confirm that the provisions for combating irregularities and fraud contained in the financing agreements signed between the Commission and recipient countries will be strengthened, and it will commit itself to improving the information given to Parliament.
Mr President, Commissioner, many thanks for your explanation.
We would not wish to delay the flow of assistance to the accession candidates, so with the agreement of my colleagues from the various groups, I wish to announce that under the conditions just described, we can proceed to a final vote.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0293/2001) by Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the joint text for a European Parliament and Council directive on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants
[C5-0323/2001 - 1998-0225 (COD)]
(Parliament approved the joint text)
Welcome
Before we continue with the vote colleagues, it is my pleasure to inform you that Mrs Chantal Compaore, wife of the President of Burkina Faso and Goodwill Ambassador of the Organisation for the Unity of Africa against female genital mutilation, and Mrs Shamin Kahn, Deputy Minister for Social Affairs of Tanzania have now taken their seats in the official gallery.
I wish to extend to them a very warm welcome on behalf of this House.
(Loud applause)
VOTE (continuation)
Mr President, do you know the difference between sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide?
I am sure you do.
You know that sulphur dioxide is written SO2 whereas, in chemistry, sulphur trioxide is written with the formula SO3.
I am sure you know that.
I did not, and thanks to this directive I have had to brush up my chemistry, which I feel is a really good thing for me personally because, had I not become an MEP, I would not have had the chance to study chemical formulae again, which are so important in this directive laying down that SO2, that is sulphur dioxide, emissions will be restricted.
I have, of course, voted for it in the interests of the well-being of all pensioners.
Report Riitta Myller (A5-0292/2001)
This directive too, Mr President, deals with the emission of harmful chemical substances into the air we breathe.
I want to confirm that I voted for it, like many of us, not only because this will enable us in future centuries to have a less polluted atmosphere that is less damaging to our health, but also because I believe that, if everybody knows that we in Europe breathe healthier, cleaner, less polluted air, we shall have more tourists in Europe who, as well as coming to see the beauty of history and nature that we have throughout Europe - in Scotland, for instance, where you come from, or in Genoa and Liguria, where I come from - if there is cleaner air as well, will come in even greater numbers!
Reports Oomen-Ruijten and Myller (A5-0293 and 0292/2001)
We voted for both the Oomen-Ruijten report and the Myller report because both propose setting emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants.
Although the proposals are limited, they do represent a slight improvement as compared with the present situation.
We nevertheless regret that because of capitalist interests and national self-interest, which are two sides of the same coin, the proposed texts delay application until 2010.
Whenever an attempt is made to control private interests, even by proposing measures in the public interest, it is always the latter that suffers in the process.
Report Marinho (A5-0274/2001)
Mr President, I voted for this regulation of the acceptance by each of the fifteen European Union Member States of the legislation of the other States, with mutual recognition of judgments and decisions, beginning in this directive with the seizing of assets and securing of evidence.
I am not in favour of this Europe, Mr President.
I should like a European criminal code, a European civil code, a European code of civil procedure and a European code of criminal procedure.
I believe that, at some point in the future, Europe will have to have the same laws in all countries.
We voted in favour of the Marinho report supporting the initiative by France, Sweden and Belgium for the adoption by the Council of a framework decision, which would greatly facilitate judicial cooperation in Europe. This would in fact involve accepting the automatic mutual recognition of judicial decisions freezing certain assets or evidence in the context of inquiries concerning certain defined offences.
This approach provides a useful means of stepping up cooperation while respecting the legal systems in the various Member States.
We would even be in favour of a more clear-cut approach.
Under the text proposed, the new mutual recognition procedure would apply to freezing orders in the context of very precise and specifically listed offences, that is to say drug trafficking, fraud affecting the European Communities' financial interests, laundering of the proceeds of crime, counterfeiting of the euro, corruption and trafficking in human beings.
However, other important offences are missing from this list.
These need to be curbed as a matter of urgency, as in the case of terrorism, which we have denounced once again over the last few days.
That is why the Members from the Movement for France support Amendment No 5, which provides for a broader definition of the offences targeted, that is all offences punishable by means of a custodial sentence or custodial security measure with a maximum duration of at least six months.
If there were a need to go beyond the freezing of assets or evidence, we should study in greater depth an improved right of safeguard system, which can be used effectively but also rapidly by the Member State receiving the application.
Report Watson (A5-0291/2001)

Mr President, on behalf of my 34 colleagues from the Social Democratic Party of Germany and also on my own behalf, I should like to make the following comments about the vote on the Watson report, which was formerly the Schmitt report. In the Federal Republic at present, the issue of immigration/asylum legislation and residence rights in Germany are the subject of a very broad debate.
The Federal government, the German Bundestag, the Länder, party commissions and cross-party commissions have been engaged in an intensive debate on issues which to some extent fall within the scope of the Watson report, and we are currently in the process of debating legislation within Parliament and between Parliament, the Federal government and the Bundesrat.
Against this background, the SPD representatives in this House have been presented with Commission proposals, the opinions of the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt - now Mr Watson - and proposals from the various groups which partly conform and partly conflict with the domestic policy issues facing Social Democrats in Germany.
On a number of points, we have therefore deviated from our group's voting behaviour or rejected the proposals. Here, our apparent proximity to the PPE-DE Group exists solely on paper, for our substantive views are generally different from theirs.
However, we joined our group in supporting the Watson report in the final vote out of our sense of Social Democratic loyalty, although in terms of German constitutional law, we had major concerns on a number of issues which we believed it was important to voice.
I felt I should explain this background because when the vote was taken in this House, we had yet to reach a position in the domestic policy debate. As a result, some of what we have agreed here does not necessarily tie in with what we are debating at home.

You will excuse me, Mr President, I mean no lack of respect to Mr Watson, whom I like a lot, but I could not help thinking of Sherlock Holmes and his faithful ally, Dr Watson. 'Elementary, my dear Watson!' is what I feel I must say at this moment, meaning that it is obvious that one must intervene to stop uncontrolled and illegal immigration.
But unfortunately I have had to vote against this measure.
Why?
Because the excellent amendments by my friend Mr Borghezio, who is sitting here beside me, were not passed. They were aimed at limiting immigration to stop the kind of thing that happened to me in Brussels: I had barely stuck my nose outside Parliament when some people who looked like immigrants snatched my MEP' s diary from me; I am still looking for it and I have not yet found it.

Mr President, the institution of political asylum is part of the most noble legal tradition of our peoples, but the Watson report, in my opinion, makes a serious mistake in extending its scope, in expanding it to embrace a number of cases that lie outside the historical nature of this important and noble institution of public law.
My amendments had a single purpose - and I thank Mr Fatuzzo for recalling it and pointing it out - which is to prevent the improper use of the institution of asylum and that of the political refugee: we are running the risk of encouraging illegal immigration which, as another Member of this Parliament has highlighted in the debates of these few days, also breeds terrorism.
It therefore seems rather serious that some political groups, who appear to be against illegal immigration, should have wanted to block my amendments with their votes.
. (FR) - As might have been feared, Parliament has just approved the proposal for a directive brought in by the Commission on the granting of refugee status, the laxity of which I condemned in the course of the preceding debate.
Parliament has also, however, found the means to add amendments which worsen these defects still further and strengthen our opposition.
In particular, the original proposal envisaged, in principle, that an appeal against a ruling rejecting a request for asylum would have a suspensive effect, permitting the asylum-seeker to remain in the territory of the country in question while awaiting a final decision, but States would be able to claim an exception to this rule in certain instances, for example, where a request was rejected as manifestly unfounded.
The European Parliament, however, removed this exception by means of Amendment No 85.
The result of this is that, even where a request is manifestly unfounded, the applicant could then remain on our territory while awaiting a final ruling on his appeal.
This intention is confirmed by the adoption of Amendment No 5, which seeks to create a "right to remain on the territory of the country of asylum until the reaching of a final decision".
Furthermore, the adoption of Amendment No 96 prevents Member States from dodging this disaster because it prevents them from abolishing the option of appealing where a request for asylum has been turned down on the grounds of being manifestly unfounded.
All these amendments are extremely serious, because they aim to settle notoriously persistent asylum seekers down for months on end to await a definitive ruling, which is bound to be negative.
In the meantime, however, they will, of course, have disappeared and gone underground.
Those who voted for these provisions know full well what they are doing.
They want to promote massive immigration, as demonstrated by the rejection of Amendment No 126 which stated that a request for asylum is manifestly unfounded if it is made only "for economic reasons or with the sole object of escaping from a general situation of poverty or from an armed conflict".
The blow that this would deal to our countries could contribute to destabilising them even further.
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the Watson report.
We agree that the EU should establish minimum standards for procedures employed in the Member States for allocating and removing refugee status.
We are nonetheless alert to the fact that the directive is covered by Title IV of the Treaty Establishing the European Community and does not apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark' s position.
. (FR) - We voted for all the amendments which seek to extend protection and provide greater rights for refugees, and likewise for the report as amended.
However, we protest against the passage which insists on States' "prerogatives of immigration control and control of entry into their territory", thereby in fact restoring to them the right to impose restrictive measures.
. The new proposals to harmonise asylum procedures across the EU are welcomed by the Green/EFA Group, as it constitutes an important step forward and is very much needed.
These proposals provide for basic norms in three key areas: the authority responsible for determining the receivability of the asylum applications, the independent institution to which the asylum seekers can resort to re-examine their application and the appeal procedure.
In particular we welcome the time limits introduced for the processing of applications which will ensure that the current backlog in many member states will be cleared and a fairer procedure brought into place.
However it must be remembered that the attempt to establish common norms regarding safe country, and the concept of safe country of origin, in general is restrictive and could be used and abused by member states.
I know that in Ireland, my own country, the government has bilateral agreements signed with Romania and Nigeria and is planning to sign more in the future.
These agreements are to speed up the procedure of deportation and fall far short of what should be done.
We feel a thorough examination of each asylum demand and a decision should be based on each individual case.
It is essential that these concepts should not be enshrined in the Directive as it would open the way for abuses of all kind, and I feel the same applies to speeding up asylum procedures which could also downgrade the quality of the procedure.
- (SV) We feel uneasy about the fact that the concepts 'safe countries of origin' and 'safe third countries' are on the way to being introduced at Community level.
Any State can potentially infringe human rights, and no country can therefore automatically be regarded as safe.
Asylum seekers must be entitled to have their cases examined on the same basis, irrespective of which country they come from.
The report makes it possible for the Member States themselves to choose whether or not they wish to make use of lists of safe countries. There is nonetheless cause for concern about the development of the principle of safe countries at Community level.
It is extremely important that we together affirm the principles under the Geneva Convention whereby everyone is entitled to have his case examined individually.
. (FR) Following the attacks on New York and Washington, there can be no consideration of any policy dealing with the movement of persons unless absolute priority is given to the implications for citizens' safety.
The implementation of asylum policy is no exception to this imperative.
Today even more than yesterday, the Watson report's proposals appear to be an example of what should not be done, because their ultimate effect would be to gravely and dangerously weaken the degree of security which the citizens of our countries must enjoy.
To multiply, indefinitely and to the point of absurdity, the guarantees of all sorts which the Watson report and the amendments adopted by Parliament propose to bestow on asylum-seekers whose requests have been adjudged to be manifestly unfounded, even though we know that three quarters of asylum requests fall into this category, may appear to be generous, but it opens the door to the gravest errors.
The concept of 'benefit of the doubt' is difficult to reconcile with the demands of security.
At a time when the most rigorous measures are being put in place, our Parliament is indulging in an extremely lax approach which can only lead to an increase in illegal immigration and, along with this, further infiltration by terrorist networks.
Why then do all the Watson report's proposals deal exclusively with asylum-seekers and none of them with the security of the citizens of European countries?
Such an imbalance, which, I might add, is found in the proposal for a directive as much as in the Watson report, is not acceptable.
It is imperative that it be corrected so that both the legitimate rights of genuine asylum-seekers and the legitimate desire of our countries' citizens for security and protection may be taken into account.
Report Marques (A5-0248/2001)
Mr President, a few days ago I was having dinner in a beautiful Italian city with a beautiful Bulgarian blonde and, to my astonishment, at a certain moment, she asked me, "But why do you still give Cohesion Fund money to Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland?
We candidate countries are very much afraid that the same will not be done with us even though we have a far, far lower gross domestic product than those countries.
Mr Fatuzzo, could you not say that a Cohesion Fund should be set up straight away for the candidate countries, who are greatly concerned that they will be falling farther and farther behind you?"
Could I have refused to accept that beautiful Bulgarian blonde' s request, Mr President?
What would you have done?
I thought it only fair to be the spokesman for her request.
- (DA) We have voted against the report because we do not believe that it is sufficiently stringent in its criticism of the Cohesion Fund.
The introduction of the common currency in the beneficiary countries of Ireland, Portugal, Greece and Spain ought, as a minimum, to cause the Fund' s activities to be suspended until such time as the first Southern and Eastern European countries have been admitted to the EU.
Resources must be channelled to where there is most need for them - namely to the candidate countries.
What we miss, too, is a more thorough and critical analysis of the way in which the Cohesion Fund is fulfilling its objectives.
There is a disproportionate focus upon maintaining the scales applicable between one country and another and between the two prioritised policy areas, and there is too little importance attached to whether the money is in fact being allocated properly.
It is not enough merely to note positive socio-economic development in the beneficiary countries and in that way to conclude that the funds are being properly distributed.
. (PT) I wish to congratulate Mr Marques on his excellent report.
It is a fine piece of work which highlights several key points.
I would like to stress the following aspects:
1. Cohesion is a treaty objective which it is vital to implement
Economic and social cohesion, which is laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty establishing the European Community as one of the essential objectives of the Union, stipulates that the present disparities between the various regions should be reduced and possible imbalances should be prevented, with a view to promoting the harmonious development of the Community.
In reality, there is still a great deal to be done to achieve this objective.
2. The Cohesion Fund fills a vital gap
Cohesion also has a fundamental role to play in progress towards economic and monetary union, which implies convergence between the economies of the Member States.
However, as the rapporteur rightly emphasises, the Maastricht Treaty did not provide for any support or cyclical adjustment measures within the framework of economic and monetary union, which means that the Structural Funds and in particular the Cohesion Fund are all the more important.
3. The objective of cohesion will not end with enlargement
The rapporteur draws attention to the fact that the disparities between the present Member States could increase because of the impact and dynamics of enlargement.
It is important to prevent this from happening and to respond to the temptations offered by those who, armed with statistics, are preparing to do away with the cohesion effort between the present 15 Member States.
The objective of cohesion will not come to an end with enlargement; indeed it may and should be reinforced following enlargement.
This will make enlargement an enormous challenge for the solidarity of the Union, requiring careful and efficient preparation taking into account the Union as a whole and its specific characteristics.
. (EL) The economic and social cohesion we hear so much about is no more than a deliberate attempt to mislead the people of Europe and impose policies on them which serve the interests of big business.
The relentless law of asymmetrical development operating within the capitalist system is not a figment of our imagination, it is a reality and the figures in the Commission's own reports confirm that there can be no talk of convergence; on the contrary, what we have is divergence between the Member States of the Community, between the rich and poor regions, even between regions within a Member State.
A typical example is Greece, where the GNP of regions such as Epirus, Mytilene or the Peloponnese has fallen rather than risen.
The per capita income in Hamburg is 440% higher than in Epirus, which is the poorest region in the ÅU.
In Greece and Portugal, 22% of the population are living below the poverty line.
Decisions by the ÅU are exacerbating social and economic differences, thereby giving the monopolies more and more options.
EMU and the Stability Pact deprive the Member States of the right to exercise monetary policy, impose budgetary discipline and reduce social expenditure and public-sector investments.
And people's earnings and the country's economy are being hit particularly hard by privatisation and, in more general terms, the structural changes being pushed forward in the form of liberalisation of the markets and reactionary decisions on the labour market.
The prevalence of atypical, short-term and temporary forms of employment, part-time employment and changes to the national insurance system, along with the concentration of capital, are exacerbating what is already an unacceptable situation.
Structural interventions funded from the Community purse are not designed to bring about real development in each region.
They disregard what is unique to and the comparative advantages of each region and are dictated by big business's demand for greater profitability and the need to serve the objectives of the Stability Pact.
As a result of this policy, considerable sums of money are being spent on showcase projects, on scrapping traditional productive sectors and on creating infrastructure works which serve private capital, helping to liberalise the markets and boost the unaccountability of the monopolies.
The workers are fighting these political choices and aims on the part of the ÅU and the adverse impact which they generate, an impact which is being paid for by the poorest sections of society, workers and pensioners, farmers with small or medium-sized holdings and small enterprises, especially in the processing and trade sectors.
. (FR) We support the principles that underpin the creation of the Cohesion Fund.
Like the rapporteur, we do believe that the Maastricht Treaty "did not provide for any economic support and adjustment mechanism in the context of economic and monetary union" and that the Stability and Growth Pact has "effectively restricted government investment."
We share the idea that such funds may be of use in environmentally friendly land-use planning.
We also believe, however, that the thinking underlying these funds contradicts the neo-liberal thinking behind European integration.
It is all very well to "link island, landlocked and peripheral regions with the central regions", but it would be even better not to fragment Europe still further by the systematic privatisation of public services.
Seen in this light, the report does not go far enough in its critique and postulates that the financial criteria of the euro and of the Stability Pact can be reconciled with the demands of real regional development.
That is why we have abstained - so as not to give succour to such an illusion.
Report Nogueira Román /A5-0247/2001)
Mr President, this document too deals with the procedures for spending the funds that the European Union has available for improving the situation in which the less fortunate European citizens live.
On this point, as the Pensioners' Party representative, Mr President, I should like to point out to Parliament as a whole, which is listening to me so carefully, as you see - I am referring of course to the television monitors that are on in our offices - that the Pensioner' s Party is requesting a rise, a marked increase in the funds that the European Union should have at its disposal to implement its activities and policy.
What we receive is too little.
In my view, it is alms for Europe.
Europe should have much, much more for all the European citizens who need to see this Europe as important and close to them.
. (EL) The asymmetrical capitalist development which characterises the economies of the ÅU can be seen in the changes which have taken place over the last decade, during which asymmetries between the Member States, between the rich and less developed regions and even within Member States of the ÅU has worsened.
Instead of convergence and cohesion, divergence is worsening, widening the gap between the rich and poor.
Even the report admits that the ÅU "still exhibits major regional asymmetries in economic and social development [and] regional asymmetries have actually increased within some Member States".
The golden triangle formed by Yorkshire, Franche-Comté and Hamburg accounts for almost half (47%) the income but only one-seventh of the surface area and one-third of the population of the ÅU, while 18% of the population of the EU is living below the poverty line.
As a result of 'labour mobility' strategies, which strengthen migration towards and the concentration of wealth in the rich central regions of the Union, flexible forms of employment and unbridled privatisation within this triangle, all policies, both national and Community, come second to the law of maximum profit.
Instead of creating jobs, we have mass redundancies and spiralling unemployment.
Even the report tells us that the ten poorest regions have an unemployment rate of 23%.
In the countries which are the main beneficiaries of Structural Funds, that is, Italy, Spain and Greece, there was a clear increase in unemployment between 1988 and 1998, especially in Greece, where the official unemployment rate of 6.7% in 1988 compares with 11.7% in 1998, an increase of about 75%.
These structural interventions are not designed to bring about real development in each region which takes account of its unique features; on the contrary, they come second to even bigger profits for big business.
Not only are funds for structural interventions both insufficient and limited, 30-40% of total funding received by the poorest Member States finds its way back to the richest Member States in the form of payment for know-how or capital equipment.
And this funding has been paid for by scrapping traditional productive sectors, changing crops, destroying agricultural produce and deserting areas.
The ones who suffer as a result are the poorest sections of society, while the ones who benefit are the monopoly behemoths and the various rodents which surround them, in that Community funds are the "pieces of silver" paid for integration into the ÅU; in a way they are a form of compensation to big business for doing away with much of the protectionism which it enjoys under a national market system.
- (FR) The report states that the Structural Funds, principally intended to promote regional development and the equality of men and women, still fall a long way short of what is needed.
Its insistent demand for "the implementation of an integrated policy to promote women's interests" is laudable and highlights an important area in which we have fallen behind.
We, too, consider that "the risk exists that economic and budgetary stability programmes could result in cutbacks in public investment, notably in transport infrastructure and R & D in the less-favoured regions" .
The report does not follow its analysis through to its conclusion, however, and does not adequately break free of such restraint.
On employment, for example, it invites the States to "continue with the employment policy process launched in Amsterdam" and makes the "national action plans for employment" its reference point.
The latter, however, merely translate into operational terms the dogma of the necessary flexibility of labour markets and are in practice contrary to the fight against precariousness to which the rapporteur refers elsewhere.
Since we are unwilling to lend our names to such a position, we have abstained.
.
(PT) The 11th Annual Report on the Structural Funds (1999) concludes the 1994-1999 programming period and thus saw the conclusion of the Delors II package of measures which made a key contribution to regional development, both as regards infrastructure and production and in terms of social integration.
Nevertheless, now that the 1994-1999 period has come to an end, the 11th Report bears witness to the fact that the cohesion situation remains unsatisfactory.
Despite the budgetary effort made with the Edinburgh package and the progress achieved, the European Union continues to be marked by enormous regional disparities in economic and social development, and there continues to be an asymmetry within the European Union between the peripheral regions - including the ultra-peripheral regions - and the centre.
Accordingly, the impact of the Structural Funds has not been sufficient to correct the disparities in production between the richest and least developed areas.
Against this background, I would like to express my support for Mr Nogueira Román's report, stressing by way of conclusion that remoteness and insularity, factors which are the hallmark of the ultra-peripheral regions, can be compensated for by developing activities financed by the Structural Funds with a view to increasing the competitiveness of the production chain, improving access to information and integrating these regions in the context of an enlarged European Union.
This should accordingly reinforce the current cohesion policy, which is more necessary than ever to meet the challenges of enlargement.
Report Valenciano Martínez-Orozco (A5-0285/2001)
The report by Mrs Martínez-Orozco is, Mr President - and I am sure you will agree with me - extremely important.
Measures must be taken so that women - not only women, but in this case women - have no fewer rights in society than men have.
In some places they have many more rights - in my home, for instance, women have more rights than men - but in the rest of the world, unfortunately, as in this case, women really have to face torture.
I therefore ask the European Union not to give a penny more in development aid to those countries that still practice female circumcision and to really implement a policy supporting respect for human rights in those states to which we do give our money.
- (FR) Although we do not support all the proposed measures, we have voted for this report.
Female genital mutilation is a barbarity to be eradicated not only because it is an act of violence with physical consequences, but also because of its purpose, which is to ensure that women' s position of inferiority is maintained.
Those who, when dealing with this subject, invoke tradition, custom, religion or any other such nonsense do no more than shroud in hypocrisy their failure to confront barbarism.
Those who dare to speak of the right to cultural differences demonstrate only their contempt both for women in general and for the peoples whose women are victims of this barbarity.
I wish to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Elena Valenciano Martinez-Orozco, and the committee as a whole for the high-quality work that they have presented to us and for the courageous social choices that they are leading us to make today.
Female genital mutilation endangers health and leads to serious and irreversible consequences such as serious and potentially fatal complications in sexual relations, pregnancy and childbirth, and so it strikes me as essential that we vote for this report today and thereby condemn all female genital mutilation, to whatever degree it is carried out.
This report is all the more deserving of a favourable vote because it calls on the Council, the Commission and the Member States, to define all female genital mutilation as a crime and to impose criminal sanctions on any of their residents who have engaged in this practice, even if the offence was committed outside the EU's borders.
This principle of the offence's extraterritoriality must be firmly upheld.
If any further proof of the need to vote for such a report were required, I shall give the following reason: the fact of being a victim of such practices, as well as that of being born a woman in a place where one runs the risk of undergoing genital mutilation must constitute valid and conclusive grounds for the right of asylum or of humanitarian protection to be granted.
The Commission, the Council and the Member States must, within the framework of the immigration and asylum policy agreed in Title IV of the Amsterdam Treaty, adopt measures on granting residence permits to the victims of this practice and recognise the right to asylum of women and girls who risk being genitally mutilated.
For the sake of equality, liberty and dignity, to which every human being has a right, it appears to me - and should appear to us all - imperative that we protect women and vote unhesitatingly for this proposal.
This is a political responsibility that we must shoulder.
.
British Conservatives, of course, deplore the practice of female genital mutilation, wherever it occurs, and we are pleased to note that in some countries it is already against the law, but we do not feel that this report will assist in ending the procedure altogether.
For this reason, Conservatives have abstained, as we feel, from an international perspective, that more diplomatic pressure should be brought to bear against those countries in which the practice of female genital mutilation is still allowed, and that world-wide education and diplomatic initiatives would be the best means to employ in order to put an end to the procedure.
Certainly, in any event, we do not wish to see an extension of the Geneva Convention of 1951 in terms of the criteria it sets out on asylum, however worthy the cause may be.
- (SV) I have voted in favour of this very important report in defence of human dignity as something unique, inviolable and shared by all in equal measure.
It is a question of giving expression to the common basis of values that European cooperation must ultimately rest upon.
Female genital mutilation causes irreparable damage to health and can even lead to death.
Any form of female genital mutilation, of whatever degree, is nothing other than an act of violence which constitutes a violation of the woman' s or girl' s fundamental rights, particularly the right to personal integrity and physical and mental health and of her sexual and reproductive rights.
Such violation and mutilation of a human being can under no circumstances be justified by respect for a religion such as Islam or by invoking traditional cultural practices or initiation ceremonies.
Religious freedom and female genital mutilation have no connection with one another.
Female genital mutilation is an assault on the rights of women and children as enshrined in several international conventions and is prohibited in the criminal legislation of the Member States.
Moreover, it is in breach of the principles of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It is therefore time for any form of female genital mutilation now to be classified in the EU' s Member States as a specificcrime, irrespective of whether or not the woman concerned has given any form of consent, and for anybody who helps, encourages, advises or procures support for anybody to carry out genital mutilation to be punished.
Report Smet (A5-0275/2001)
Mr President, I cannot help saying something about the report by Mrs Smet, who has specified that when women work they get lower wages than men in average earnings.
Why can I not help saying something?
Because I want to uphold in this Chamber the view that it is fair, precisely for this reason, that women in many European Union states draw their pensions five years before men do.
This happens in Italy, Greece, Germany, Spain and many other states, but not in all of them.
I think this is fair because it partly makes up for the lower wages women receive when they work.
I should therefore like this to happen in all fifteen states in the European Union.
- (DA) After 25 years of the Equal Pay Directive, there are still differences between women' s and men' s pay.
It is estimated that 15 per cent of this difference in pay is due to gender and not to other factors such as seniority, management responsibility and such like. The principle of equal pay for work of equal value has therefore still not made itself felt.
An extra effort must therefore be made to ensure that it is the job and the responsibilities, and not the individual' s gender, which decide how much he or she is paid.
We support the report, which we believe contains a number of sensible recommendations.
We wish to emphasise that, if unfair differences in pay are to be successfully stamped out, greater openness and transparency must be ensured in the way in which pay is determined.
We also want to emphasise that individual countries must make sure they have reasonable conditions for women' s participation in the labour market (child care facilities etc), if the goal of equal pay for work of equal value is to be achieved.
.
(PT) As you will know, although the principle of equal pay for work of equal value for women and men is laid down in the 1951 Convention No 100 of the ILO and the 1957 Treaty of Rome, as subsequently developed and improved by Community legislation, discrimination continues to take place, as the Smet report indicates, with an average wage gap in the EU of 28%.
Even taking into account the structural differences between men and women in the labour market, such as age, training, occupation and career pattern, women's pay is still 15% lower, on average, than that of men, which can only be explained by value discrimination mechanisms.
This is unacceptable.
The issue of the wage discrimination which is practised against women in reality, and the underlying mechanisms, have been analysed in relative depth, although there are many shortcomings, in particular in statistical information for the European Union and the Member States.
However, as the rapporteur states, one thing is clear: this wage gap can only be reduced by means of a twin-track policy.
This involves on the one hand attempting to improve women's position in the labour market, and on the other hand eliminating discrimination during the pay negotiation process.
We therefore consider it important that this issue should be treated as a top priority, including the Commission's proposal to launch a Europe-wide campaign on equal pay in 2002.
But it is equally important that a proposal should be brought forward to revise and update the 1975 Equal Pay Directive.
.
(DE) We have been discussing equal pay for equal work and for work of equal value since my youth, and that is a long time ago.
The ILO's Equal Remuneration Convention has existed since 1951.
In the European Community the principle of 'equal pay for equal work' was laid down in Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome in 1958.
Yet as is always the case whenever it is a matter of justice for women in any walk of life, in implementing the principle of equal pay, the politicians are dragging their feet, as are the trade unions, unfortunately, which are still male-dominated organisations.
We have had the Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women since 1975.
We have action programmes and a Community framework strategy on gender equality.
We have countless resolutions and guidelines.
We have the Beijing Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth UN World Conference on Women in 1995.
And now we have this report which - in view of the fact that the average wage gap between men and women in the EU still stands at almost 30% - is by no means unnecessary, for on women's issues in particular, we know that constant dripping wears away stone.
In the 17 recitals and 19 paragraphs contained in this resolution, which I support, we have put forward a great many sound and useful proposals designed to eliminate this wage gap, which continues even after retirement and especially affects women with lower pension provision, thus resulting in lifelong discrimination.
It is clear that action is required from the social partners in particular. However, what is also required is courage from the women concerned and their representatives, especially the women's organisations.
In reality, we have sound legal bases on which to act against wage discrimination.
. (EL) The harsh reality of the huge social problems which plague workers, both male and female, not only shows up every pronouncement about equality and prosperity for what it is in practice, and in the harshest possible manner, it also makes them look provocative and derisory.
The first and the main victims of this miserable market- and competitiveness-based policy are women. Unemployment hits women.
Women are bountifully offered flexible forms of employment, with the result that they provide cheap labour, receive less money for the same job and face worse problems of job insecurity and unequal access to the labour market. It is still mainly women who fill the more menial, unskilled jobs and who rarely hold responsible, higher management jobs in economic, social and political life.
The severe blows raining down on social rights and social gains will become even more severe with the planned changes to the social security system, putting an even greater burden on women, who have to carry out many duties and fill two or even three roles.
There can be so such thing as equal opportunities for women within an exploitative society, an underemployed society with no equivalent social prospects and no state welfare.
We need to provide equal access for women, we need to strengthen and extend legislation to protect unhealthy professions and maternity and we need to introduce measures to safeguard all atypical forms of work.
Only the workers' struggle can overturn the anti-grass roots polices being promoted and improve women's lot.
Only the worker's struggle will really improve the position of women in society.
And we are by their side in this struggle.
Report Andersson (A5-0283/2001)
Mr President, some time ago I met my brother.
I have a brother called Edgardo Fatuzzo, who lives in Novara, but unfortunately we do not see each other very often.
When we last saw each other and he heard I was an MEP for the Pensioners' Party, elected to Brussels by pensioners, and that I am the national secretary of this party in Italy, he said to me, "As you are in politics, do you know that when we work and are over fifty they make it quite clear to us that they cannot wait for us to give up our jobs, and they make us feel we are a burden?
This is because there are too many young people and they get lower wages; we, however, are slow to understand progress and earn more."
Well, I should like it to be considered harassment when older people are harassed for the sole reason that they have grown old in their jobs, a point which unfortunately is not mentioned in this document.
The report treats as being on the same level what it terms " 'vertical' harassment (of a subordinate by a superior, or vice versa), peer-group ( 'horizontal') harassment or harassment of a mixed type".
Whilst condemning harassment, the report overlooks the fact that relationships at these different levels are not equivalent.
The boss has a power over his employees that they do not have over him.
Those who are at the summit of the hierarchy established by the boss have the right to decide on the allocation of work to their subordinates or even on whether these are employed at all.
The new expression 'harassment at work' is founded on the old exploitative relationships.
Our abstention indicates that, whilst we agree with this condemnation, very limited though it is, we do not wish to give the support of our names to these untruths by omission.
.
(PT) We voted in favour of this report because we consider that it deals properly with the serious problem of bullying and sexual harassment at the workplace.
As indicated in the report, according to a survey of 21 500 workers in the European Union carried out by the Dublin Foundation, 8% state that over the last 12 months they have been subject to bullying at work, which if extrapolated to the total workforce means that over 12 million workers are probably victims of this kind of situation throughout the 15 Member States.
As the report warns us, although the true scale of this phenomenon is unknown, it is a serious problem in working life, and it is equally certain that the general increase in short-term contracts and insecurity of employment, especially among women, is creating conditions that encourage the practice of various forms of harassment.
We therefore support the measures proposed in the report for combating this phenomenon, including those for preventing it, those for increasing knowledge about it, exchanges of positive experience and the publication of a Green Paper by no later than March 2002, followed by an action programme of measures at Community level against bullying at work.
. (FR) Eight per cent of workers in the EU, that is to say 12 million people, claim to have been victims of psychological and sexual harassment at work.
This has devastating effects on the physical and mental health of those - most frequently women - who are subjected to it.
As the rapporteur has emphasised, these practices are due to "the growing number of short-term contracts and insecurity of employment."
Combating harassment at work, therefore, involves restoring to each worker security of status, acceptable working conditions and a decent wage.
All employees, however, need more rights within companies: the right to organised representation, the right to defend themselves and the right to social security benefits such as occupational health provision.
There is also a need for uniform legislation specific to this issue to be put in place and applied consistently across all the EU Member States.
At present, only France has legislated against harassment.
It is, moreover, equally important to clarify the employer's responsibility in this area.
This report is a step in the right direction and for that reason we have voted for it.
- (SV) We have abstained from voting on Mr Andersson' s report on harassment at the workplace.
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union.
European integration provides an opportunity to find solutions to cross-border problems, such as those concerning the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management.
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those whom they affect.
That is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the European Union in which the distribution of responsibilities is clear to everyone.
It must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU must only attend to those issues which it is best qualified to deal with, namely the cross-border issues.
Harassment at the workplace is, of course, a problem, and as much as possible must be done in various ways to do away with such harassment.
We do not, however, believe that measures to combat this problem are best taken at EU level.
For us, it is important for the EU to concentrate instead on areas in which it can really do some good.
This is not such an area.
Report Coelho (A5-0233/2001)
Mr President, in this document by Mr Coelho rules are laid down regarding the crossing of the external borders of the European Union.
We should remember, then, that in a very few years the borders will be extended: the borders of Europe will be moved much further east.
We therefore need right now, not in 2004, to bring in tighter regulations on access, on crossing the forthcoming borders, which are not the current ones, and to increase the possibilities of really, actually moving around within our fifteen Member States.
In conclusion: tougher restrictions on the external borders and greater access across the former borders, which are the internal borders of the fifteen and soon the twenty-three European Union Member States.
. (EL) The report contains a plethora of data which reveal how the Schengen Convention has worked in practice in the 10 states which apply it in full and it goes a long way towards substantiating our opinion of it as an authoritarian, anti-democratic, collective agreement.
To be specific, it admits of omissions and oversights with respect to transparency and democratic control, violations even of the famous EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, a lack of transparency on the role of Europol, the absence of information for the European Parliament etc.
It is particularly revealing with regard to the Schengen Information System (that is, personal electronic records), in which 89% of personal information pertains to 'unwanted' persons.
Documents which should be destroyed are used to supplement police records, data is kept on "persons whose identity has been usurped with no attempt to inform the legitimate older of the identity" and "there is a lack of clear criteria for entering data on the system, in particular in relation to unwanted aliens".
As far as the free movement of people is concerned, the report criticises England and Ireland for maintaining controls on internal borders and France for checking persons arriving from the Netherlands, due to the legislation of the surrounding countries (and especially Holland) on narcotics, but says not a word about the imposition of controls and the ban on allowing EU citizens to enter France or Sweden in order to take part in demonstrations in Nice and Gothenburg.
However, Genoa provides the most representative picture of what Schengen means: on the one hand, the restriction on free movement with suffocatingly tight police controls and entry bans and, on the other, full - if not abusive - application of personal electronic records and police collaboration (Euro-police).
All this confirms that the Schengen Convention is a tool which is used to make it easier to carry out the job of pan-European suppression, make and monitor suspects and terrorise demonstrators.
The situation is becoming even worse following the witch hunt unleashed by the USA with the help and forbearance of the ÅU on the pretext of the tragic events of 11 September.
The aim is to silence every voice which speaks out against or even doubts their anti-grass roots policy, supposedly in the name of fighting 'terrorism' .
Some of the proposals in the report are of a technocratic nature (more information for the European Parliament, Council approval for a binding legal framework to protect personal data, approval for the role of the Joint Supervisory Authority).
However, they are accompanied by a proposal to introduce a Community information system, that is, a single computer network for data from the Schengen, Europol and Customs Use conventions in order to make personal electronic records even more efficient, again in the name of freedom, security and justice!
For these reasons, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece have voted against the report.
A matter of days after the terrible terrorist acts which struck New York and Washington, the Chairperson of Eurojust, Mrs Michèle Coninsx, who is also a senior Belgian judge, has just made some extraordinary statements in the 14 September issue of one of the major Paris daily papers. To the question 'Is this amorphous collection of Islamicists firmly established in Europe?'
Mrs Coninsx replied: "Europe can be a logistical fallback base for these terrorists. The Schengen area, in fact, makes the borders relatively easy to cross ".
This timely assessment of the situation may be added to, unfortunately, numerous others made over recent years in various fields, whether drug trafficking, the theft of works of art, illegal immigration, organised crime... One is all the more surprised when one reads the triumphalist report on the Schengen system, which has been laid before us today.
For example, in the Council's introduction, we read: "thousands of travellers have crossed open borders unhindered, without security within the Schengen area suffering any visible detriment."
One wonders whether the person who drew up the Council's report was perhaps suffering from hallucinations.
For its part, the report of the European Parliament not only repeats the same errors, but adds to them an order directed at the United Kingdom and at Ireland, which are invited to participate fully in Schengen and thus to completely abolish border controls on persons.
This would, of course, be more practical for France, which would witness the dispersal of the tragic groups of illegal immigrants waiting in the north of the country to cross to Great Britain.
It would not, however, resolve the fundamental question: how did these illegals manage to cross Europe and reach Calais without being seen?
Does the Schengen system not bear an overwhelming responsibility for this?
The day after the terrorist attacks on the United States, we called for the EU to revise all its policies in order to prioritise citizens' security.
We certainly heard some fine speeches against terrorism in this House yesterday, but today, we can clearly see the habitual drift starting again without any qualms at all.
The Schengen system, in the guise of a gradual abolition of controls at the internal borders of the EU countries concerned, reinforces controls at the borders of the Union itself and makes conditions of access stricter.
Whilst claiming to facilitate the movement of persons, Schengen makes it more difficult for all those who are not natives of the European Union.
Our vote against this report is an expression of our opposition to both the spirit and the letter of the Schengen Convention.
The enlargement of the European Union by the integration of certain Eastern European countries makes the Schengen Convention all the more shocking, as the Schengen borders put up additional barriers among national communities living in more than one country simultaneously.
Finally, even the slight advantages of the Convention, that is to say, the end of controls at the internal borders of the Schengen area, are random, being subject to the discretion of States which are able to re-establish such controls.
The Coelho report on the development of Schengen cooperation is unsatisfactory from our point of view for numerous reasons.
For us to propose today the reinforcement of the Schengen system, is to reinforce the exclusion of all those men and women, asylum-seekers and immigrants, who for economic and/or political reasons aspire to live as residents of the European Union.
This Fortress Europe is shown day by day to be unjust and inhumane by the treatment meted out to immigrants in refugee centres, detention centres and other closed institutions.
This Europe that Schengen has created is not democratic - as the rapporteur makes clear by putting the emphasis on the "major and serious shortcomings [which] have existed with regard to transparency and democratic control".
There is a need for another policy on the reception of immigrants particularly to regularise the position of those without personal documentation and to respect fundamental rights.
After all, what credibility is left to this area without borders which permits free movement of citizens, when States arrogate to themselves the right to close their borders to peaceful protesters, as at the Nice and Genoa Summits?
Freedom of movement within Europe must be recognised as an inalienable right.
For these reasons, we are unable to vote for this Report.
. (FR) Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union defined as its objective "to maintain and develop the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is assured"...
To put it another way, the Schengen accords are often summed up too readily as being about the free movement of European citizens, but this can only, according to these same accords, be taken as read when they are guaranteed freedom, security and justice.
The present, however, when crazed attacks have just struck the United States, brings us back to face some cruel realities: the notion of a Western sanctuary, sheltered from violence and in which nothing more would be needed than to grant rights without demanding duties, whilst maintaining a principled abstention from any coercive action, now lies smashed to smithereens.
Whilst I would not wish to suggest that our manifest solidarity with the victims and with the American people must necessarily impel us henceforth to join blindly in any crusade decided on in Washington, it is clear that a menace of the same kind is hovering over our European capitals.
I might well say, Mr Coelho, that your report strikes us as surreal against this backdrop, because, from our point of view, the re-establishment of border controls has never seemed so necessary as it does today.
(Speech cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure.)
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting was closed at 12.20 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament, adjourned on Thursday 20 September 2001.
Statement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, and as you can imagine, it is my sad duty to have to open this session of Parliament with the news of several disasters that have claimed the lives of many people.
When I have finished reading the statement, I would like to suggest that we observe a minute' s silence to pay tribute to the victims.
On 21 September, Toulouse was struck by a disaster on an unprecedented scale, in which 29 people died and 2500 were injured.
We have all been concerned and deeply saddened by the suffering of the victims' families, of the injured and by the grief of the people of Toulouse.
Following the explosion at the AZF factory, I sent a message on behalf of Parliament, and on my own behalf, to the Mayor of Toulouse, Mr Douste-Blazy and to his fellow citizens, to express our solidarity and deepest sympathy.
The exact causes of this awful disaster are still unknown, but one thing is certain: France, and all the countries of the European Union, must make a firm commitment to ensure that a tragedy like this never happens again.
It will be held up as an example of what we must no longer tolerate, wherever similar risks exist.
People' s safety must never be compromised due to negligence, passivity or an overriding concern to save money.
In a repeat of previous incidents, this time in Northern Ireland, a journalist, Martin O' Hagan, was murdered on European Union soil by terrorists with a single objective - to spread fear by firstly attacking those who work to inform others.
This appalling act is an attack by its perpetrators on the fundamental values of the European Union, namely the right to life, the rule of law and the freedom of expression.
Under no circumstances must these acts of terrorism call into question the efforts of all those who, in spite of the difficulties they encounter, are working tirelessly to finally achieve the goals of the peace process.
On 27 September, a mentally disturbed man carried out a horrific attack on the Parliament of the Swiss canton of Zug, tragically killing 14 members of the local Parliament and government and also injuring approximately 10 people.
As soon as I heard of these senseless murders, I sent, on behalf of everyone, our most sincere condolences to the authorities and a message of solidarity to the relatives of those killed and wounded.
Earlier this afternoon, we heard the news that a suicide attack was carried out against the Parliament of Kashmir in India, a despicable act in which 22 people have been killed so far and approximately 30 have been injured.
The explosion also caused very considerable damage to the area around the Parliament building.
We are all distressed and saddened by this attack.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to propose that we pay tribute to the victims of all these attacks by now observing a minute' s silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Speeches relating to points of order:
Onesta (Verts/ALE).
(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your words of sympathy and solidarity.
On the morning of Friday 21 September, I was at home, less than two kilometres from the site of the explosion, and I can tell you that I now know what a tragedy really is.
We have, all of us here, seen the images of this explosion on the television.
I believe, and I can even be sure, that all my fellow Members from my region, such as Mrs Ainardi, Mrs de Veyrac, Mr Rod, join me in thanking all the Members who have expressed their sympathy and solidarity.
I would also like to show you a damaged and charred metal girder, which I found at the factory site, over a kilometre from where the explosion occurred.
Now you can imagine the state of the bodies that were found to the south of Toulouse.
Ladies and gentlemen, having observed a minute' s silence at the beginning of today' s debate, we must now try to restore the confidence of people everywhere who fear these bombs, and, as you have said, Madam President, we must ensure, with the votes we cast this week and by taking bold resolutions, that the disaster that occurred in Toulouse really is the last in a series of already too many incidents of this kind.
Ladies and gentlemen, with your agreement, I would like to propose to give the floor to the Members who have requested to speak. This is an exceptional case - and I do mean exceptional - and is on account of the scale of the recent disasters.
Madam President, what you have just said demonstrates that we must now be especially careful about the public statements we make and it is significant that you have spoken about four disasters: two of which have taken place in or around parliaments - in Switzerland and in Kashmir.
I want to say this because I wish to express my solidarity and that of my group with the statements by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Patten, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Michel, the President of the French Republic, Mr Chirac, and in this case I regret that we have not heard him speak - since he always does so authoritatively, bravely and appropriately - in relation to the unfortunate public remarks of the President of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Italy, Mr Berlusconi, on the supposed superiority of Western civilisation over other civilisations.
I believe it is especially important now for the European Parliament to state strongly once again, that this is not a clash of civilisations, but, rather, that we have to defend values that are shared by all humanity.
I therefore believe it is important that we, in the European Parliament, clearly express and demonstrate an approach, which is not just the approach of my group, and in this case I would like to address Mr Poettering to say that I was the first to applaud when, at the special sitting we held on the attacks of 11 September, he expressly cited the speech of Anwar al-Sadat in this Parliament.
I believe that remarks such as those by Mr Berlusconi must be criticised by all of us and I hope, because it is not the first time, that they will not be repeated, since they damage the European cause throughout the world.
(Applause from the left)
Madam President, to continue on the same theme, in the wake of the events of 11 September, Parliament gained a very broad consensus on the need to quash any equation of Islam with terrorism, substantiating the unacceptable and dangerous theory that this is a clash of civilisations.
On the other hand, we recall Mr Solana' s words, spoken in the same spirit, who had advised - and I quote - that we must not create a rift, as this would be a huge mistake.
Mr Berlusconi' s astounding and deeply shameful words show how important it is to issue a very clear response.
First of all, we must strongly condemn the age-old rumour of the purported superiority of Western civilisation and Christianity.
Then, we must decide upon an initiative, along the lines of Article 7 of the Treaty of Nice, enabling the Council to determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a Member State of the fundamental principles of the European Union and to address recommendations to that State.
I therefore suggest, Madam President, that the Conference of Presidents examines what significant political action we would be advised to take in this matter.
(Applause from the GUE/NGL Group)
Madam President, I would like to say again on behalf of our group what I said on 12 September - I believe with the agreement of all in this European Parliament - namely that the terror perpetrated by human beings must not be confused with the peace-loving Muslim faith.
I refer back to Anwar el Sadat's tremendous speech to the European Parliament on 10 February 1981 - we were meeting in Luxembourg in those days - in which he said: "Islam is a religion of love and not of hatred".
On behalf of our group, I wish again to observe that we oppose the rhetoric which speaks of a clash of civilisations and that we desire partnership and friendship with all peace-loving Arab and Islamic countries.
It is precisely for that reason, indeed, that I proposed that we should convene the Mediterranean Forum.
I am given to understand, Madam President, that you too have it in mind to submit a proposal to this end.
Having been addressed personally, I wish to point out certain misunderstandings which originate with a Member of the Commission.
We agreed in the Conference of Presidents - Mr Barón Crespo was unable to be there last Thursday - that we do not want to make this the subject of the debate here in the plenary sitting but wish, rather, in the Conference of Presidents on Thursday, to consult with the Member of the Commission about the remarks that have been made.
On behalf of our group, let me say here and now that we reach out our hands to all peace-loving Muslims, wherever they live throughout the world, be it outside the European Union, in the Arab and Islamic states or in a country of the European Union; we want peace, partnership and friendship with all Muslims of good will!
Madam President, I would like to congratulate you on the speech you made the night the heads of government met in Brussels.
Parliament was represented, I was present, and I think you struck exactly the right note for Parliament.
Madam President, I think we have a huge responsibility after what has happened and our response needs to reflect the seriousness of these events.
And that, I think, applies not just to us but to the Heads of State who have applied to become members of the European Union.
That is why I should like, albeit reluctantly, to refer to the statements made by Mr Ecevit, who is trying to cash in on the terrorist incidents by levying accusations of terrorism against the Republic of Cyprus at a time when he, himself, is illegally occupying Northern Cyprus, as you quite rightly said during your visit to Athens.
Madam President, I want to say some words about Martin O'Hagan, the journalist murdered in Northern Ireland a couple of days ago.
He was a fearless journalist who over many years tirelessly illuminated that twilight world where gangsters and political terrorism and political extremism intersect.
He has paid the ultimate price for his bravery.
It is an unfortunate fact of our life in this world today that many hundreds of journalists die virtually every year in pursuit of their vocation of serving and informing the public.
This does not happen so often in democratic societies and it is particularly worrying, therefore, that journalists in Northern Ireland are at risk in this way.
The few words I have said about Martin O'Hagan are entirely inadequate to convey the shock and the horror that people of all political and religious persuasions in Ireland feel at this horrible deed.
I should like to link this with other matters we have debated at previous part-sessions - indeed I am sure we will be debating them again this week - and make an appeal about the language we use to describe these terrorists.
We should stop referring to them as Protestants, Catholics or Muslims: they are political extremists.
It is important that we make that distinction.
The individuals concerned adhere to one or other religion, or have no religion, but their objectives are political, and the one common thing that unites them is their contempt for democracy and humanity.
(Applause)
Madam President, as a parliamentarian I feel myself to be represented by the President of this House above all others, and so it is to you that I wish to address a very specific query relating to what was said by Mr Barón Crespo.
The Italian Prime Minister's statement has been criticised by many, including - which may be surprising - by Mr Haider, who found it too xenophobic.
Madam President, you have always strongly advocated dialogue with Islam, and have also taken definite steps in the direction of such dialogue.
Your policy stands in contradiction to what Mr Berlusconi has said.
In view of the fact that you have had very forthright things to say in other situations - which I did not always find easy to defend back home, but I defended you because I have always valued your clear language - I think it important that you should find equally clear and unambiguous words in this connection.
It is this that I ask of you.
Perhaps these words have passed me by; perhaps I have not heard them or not read them.
I would ask you to make this Parliament's position in respect of these remarks quite clear.
This is a Parliament that has always promoted dialogue and has always engaged in it.
Our whole existence as a Parliament is bound up with the dialogue between religions and between cultures, and I believe that you, as President of this Parliament, should say so clearly and unambiguously on this occasion.
(Applause from the PSE Group)
Mr Swoboda, I must say that I am surprised to hear your comments, because I do feel that I have made my views well known since 11 September, whether in press releases, or with regard to Mrs Banotti' s speech or what Mr Berlusconi said.
Had you closely followed your President' s movements and official visits, you would be aware of my views.
I shall send you some press cuttings, which are extremely enlightening and will, I believe, bring you up-to-date.
I even believe that I may have been one of the first people - since you are giving me the opportunity to bring this up - to draw attention to the risk of an equation of Islam with terrorism.
This was a natural thing to do as President and I knew that I was repeating the views of the House by stating this, and I certainly made this very clear in my first statement.
Perhaps you also recall that I said this at the opening of the exceptional sitting that was held on the Wednesday, the day after the events.
I will, however, send you all the details.
Madam President, it is a matter of great surprise and regret to me that the Chairman of a major political group such as the Group of the Party of European Socialists should get caught up in the false, subversive controversy which originated in the Italian political debate and which it is absurd to think could be continued in this House. The issue has already been thoroughly addressed in Italy and it is certainly not evidence of a problem at European level but merely of a misunderstanding or, worse, the subversive interpretation of a phrase which could have been interpreted differently.
Moreover, the Italian Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, has provided ample explanation of what he meant by the statement, which he intended to be extremely positive.
The difference between the two civilisations is clear, and his intention was merely to highlight and emphasise that there is a great difference as regards genuine freedom, which exists in the West but not in the East, as regards equal opportunities for men and women, which are established in the West but denied in the East, and as regards all those differences in civilisation which - it cannot be denied - are there.
That was what Mr Berlusconi meant by his statement, but, of course, everyone has read and interpreted it in their own way.
Madam President, I would go so far as to say that it would be dangerous for this House to focus on a statement such as this now: at such a sensitive time as this, we need clarity, transparency and positive thinking - not a vitriolic debate - and, most importantly, we have to have the ability, which I do not see in the opposition, to extend a hand and interpret what people say in the positive sense intended rather than always placing a negative interpretation on things.
It is therefore our intention to oppose any initiative seeking to open an interim procedure in this House, as has been suggested.
Ladies and gentlemen, as I said, due to exceptional circumstances, I agreed to move the points of order because I thought that you would like the opportunity to speak about the awful disasters, which were, sadly, the subject of my statement.
Now that we no longer are speaking on points of order relating to the statement, we shall continue as usual, in other words, the remaining points of order shall be heard immediately after the agenda has been established.
A number of Members have just asked me about this and I believe that this is a perfectly legitimate request.
Agenda
Madam President, I believe that this Parliament is making a certain degree of progress in dealing with issues which concern our citizens and in which the European Union must have a political profile.
I believe that in the case of the Toulouse disaster the change to the agenda is perfectly justified.
I believe that the case of Afghanistan is highly topical for two reasons: the first is the humanitarian tragedy of the people of Afghanistan, who are the principal victims of the Taliban regime.
Every day there is more and more news about the desperate condition of millions of people. Almost a fifth of the population (more than five million people) have practically nothing to eat.
The European Union is contributing to the humanitarian effort, but I believe this is an issue on which we have to state our position.
Secondly, the political issue.
You yourself set an example, to a certain extent bypassing certain rules of protocol, international law and diplomacy, by bringing Commander Massoud here.
I believe that we are also currently committed to a political solution which will bring stability to Afghanistan, and it is notable that, when a person who could establish a degree of mediation in Afghanistan, the exiled ex-king in Rome, proposed the calling of a Grand Assembly, the Loya Jirga, which could bring the various tribes together, he did so together with American congressmen, but we were not involved, although the Community troika has visited more or less the whole region.
I believe that it makes sense for Parliament, with the current participation of the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Michel, and the Commissioner responsible, Vice-President Patten, to be able to hold a debate on such an important issue, which is not just one more urgent subject, but which is an absolutely fundamental issue in relation not only to the fight against terrorism, but also to the stabilisation of Central Asia and the fight to prevent a humanitarian tragedy.
These are the reasons why my group has proposed this change to the agenda.
Madam President, I have all due respect for Mr Barón Crespo' s proposal and solicitude.
However, this week, we have a well-prepared debate on terrorism, the root of which can be found in Afghanistan, among other countries, under the guise of Osama bin Laden.
I would be surprised if Parliament were now to hold a less well-prepared debate on the issue of Afghanistan, also at the risk of mixing up the two debates.
I feel strongly about holding a clear debate on terrorism.
As a final point, for the resolution, we for our part have also drafted texts which give due consideration to the humanitarian problems that have now arisen at the Afghan-Pakistani border, and we also comment on the budgetary implications of our aid.
I hope that this text will receive broad support.
In my opinion, it is much preferable to deal with the Afghanistan issue at a later date, should this appear necessary, when we can prepare for it properly, for we are now dealing with an extremely important and complex problem.
I would therefore ask if we could this week confine ourselves to the debate on terrorism, and only briefly touch upon the humanitarian dimension to which Mr Barón Crespo referred. We could then deal with the policy with regard to Afghanistan on a separate occasion, but not this week.
I shall now put to the vote the request by the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Madam President, I would very much like to add to what has been said.
You win some, you lose some - that is normal.
But we need proper preparation in matters as serious as this.
Mr Barón Crespo, the right time for calm discussion of this would have been at the Conference of Presidents last Thursday, when you were absent - which is not an accusation, these things happen to us all.
It would be a good thing if this House were to have a joint ballot on such important issues.
I ask you to arrange things in the future so that we discuss such matters in the Conference of Presidents in the first instance.
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
Madam President, this is the second time that Mr Poettering, who has been absent from the Conference of Presidents more often than I have, has reproached me for not being there on Thursday.
I was in Budapest, I know, but it has to be said that Mr Poettering was the only Group Chairman present.
The others were replaced.
And the Socialist Group was duly and worthily represented.
There is therefore no place for this sort of argument.
Secondly, if this procedure exists at the moment it is because Parliament has sovereignty when it comes to deciding its agenda and in my speech I referred to information and events that have arisen since Thursday.
Since I do not have the gift of prophecy that Mr Poettering appears to have, I cannot know on a Thursday what is going to happen on the following Sunday and therefore I think it makes sense that Parliament should reflect and vote when the time comes.
Madam President, in reference to Wednesday's agenda following the point made by Mr Barón Crespo, last Tuesday I and two other Members of this House had the honour of meeting with the former king of Afghanistan, Mohammed Zahir Shah.
At that meeting we discussed the possibility of his playing a role in some form of mediation in Afghanistan leading to the restoration of the democracy which he established in 1964, and which involved free media, free elections and the involvement of women in politics - a very far cry from the current state of affairs in Afghanistan.
He also asked us to extend his respects to you, Madam President, and to the House as a whole, and hoped that in due course he would be able to visit the European Parliament.
Yesterday I spoke to Mr Patten on this matter and hope there will be some development in this regard involving not only Parliament but the European Union as a whole.
On the agenda for Wednesday, it seems to me rather sad that, in spite of the special nature of this international situation, reflected by our solemn sitting the day after the events in America on 11 September and the succeeding week, the Council has made a number of proposals for legislation following the terrorist acts which many of us consider as tantamount to an act of war.
In this regard, the European Parliament will no doubt be involved in the normal procedures.
It would be helpful to have a longer debate on Wednesday and not take the Ghent Council with the question of terrorism.
Secondly, could you give us some indication of when the House will know the procedures to be followed with its committees for the examination, with proper scrutiny, of the proposals now being made by the Council?
Mr McMillan-Scott, we shall try to organise this as best we can.
As regards the former king of Afghanistan, I must also share some information with you.
I actually met him on Tuesday 11 September when I was in Italy attending a meeting of 500 young people in Rome.
I made an appointment and, on behalf of the European Parliament, I went to meet the former king of Afghanistan.
I believe that everyone will see this as a step in the right direction.
We shall therefore try to organise everything properly and as you would wish.
Relating to Thursday:
I have three requests to add headings to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance and the item entitled 'Human Rights' .
Madam President, last week, those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party were agreed that there is only one urgent subject that ought to be dealt with in Parliament in this plenary sitting, and that is international terrorism and the need to build an international coalition to combat this.
Unfortunately, we were unable to get anywhere with that point of view last week in the Conference of Presidents, and that is something we regret.
We shall naturally participate in this vote.
I requested the floor in order simply to emphasise that those of us in the ELDR Group think we should have focused our energies on the one urgent subject which we are all thinking about and which will cast its shadow for many years to come.
(Applause from the ELDR Group)
Madam President, I do not wish to waste Parliament' s precious time on an issue which has already been addressed by Mr Santini and which has already been quite satisfactorily resolved in Italy.
I would just like to point out that, as always, where Mr Berlusconi is concerned, every event is prey to political exploitation.
This behaviour towards a Head of State is improper and inappropriate.
Madam President, I am one of those Members of this House whose cultural background is not exactly Christian.
There was a statement recently by a statesman, who should speak in a statesmanlike manner, but who, when speaking about Muslims and Christians, actually, in my opinion, dropped something of a clanger.
I deeply regret that we were unable to deliver a joint response, but had to have a discussion instead.
I greatly regret this, because we should be counteracting escalation.
A dialogue is urgently needed specifically between Muslims and Christians.
The Italian Prime Minister's spoken contribution added nothing, but was highly counter-productive.
For this reason, I greatly regret that we were unable to counter it with a common response.
Madam President, I would like to go back to Mr Berlusconi' s statements, not least because it is an issue which extends beyond Italian concern, as is indicated by the reactions of all the Heads of State and Government to these statements.
I have to say, Madam President, that we Italians - or at least the majority of the Italians sitting in this House - are particularly concerned by Mr Berlucsoni' s statements because these statements, in addition to being in blatant conflict with the conclusions of the Brussels European Council, subscribed to by Mr Berlusconi himself, moreover, reflect the attitude - which I hope has ceased to prevail - of part of the majority supporting the Italian government.
In matters such as these which, regrettably, can carry such weight as to tip the balance towards war or peace, exploitation for political ends is unacceptable; however, equally unacceptable are superficial expressions which, I am sad to say, appear to mask attitudes of intolerance which must be opposed.
Without wishing to exacerbate the issue, we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that, after 11 September, a major government coalition party held public demonstrations with boards saying 'Immigrants = terrorists' , and that, in recent days, two mayors of cities in Northern Italy from the same party have ordered the closure of the premises used as mosques.
That, Madam President, is why we will feel more reassured if you too, as President of this Parliament, particularly following Mr Santini' s words, were to confirm a clear message of open dialogue, such as Parliament has already had occasion to send to the Muslim Arab communities and countries with which we intend to work to combat terrorism, together, openly and resolutely.
Madam President, Mr Berlusconi was certainly wrong to talk of superiority and a clash of civilisations. These are words which do nothing to promote dialogue.
Nevertheless, at this time when major alliances are being formed, I would like to send out from this House a personal message of great solidarity and support to the Afghan, Saudi, Iranian, Kuwaiti and Chechen women, to the women of all those countries who are currently fighting and will continue to fight in the coming years.
It is my genuine hope that the formation of this great alliance to combat terrorism will not mean that the issue of these women' s rights will be relegated to second place yet again.
Madam President, in my view, we could have, when dealing with the points of order, quite legitimately gone back to the absolutely scandalous words of Mr Berlusconi, who has designs on being the future president of the European Union.
My colleague and the Chairman of my group, Mr Barón Crespo, and my colleague Mr Swoboda were demanding that you condemn outright the words of Mr Berlusconi.
Every Member of this House is aware that we had a very broad consensus on avoiding the risks of an equation of Islam with terrorism and condemning anything that could be seen to be a war between civilisations.
But we expect you to condemn outright what Mr Berlusconi said. That is my point of order.
Madam President, Mr Poettering's highly credible words show that he represents only part of his group, for hardly had he come to the end of his speech than Mr Santini asserted the very opposite of what Mr Poettering had described as being the position of the Christian Democrat Members of this House.
It would, then, be consistent of Mr Poettering to call upon the Forza Italia members of his group to fall in with the group's position, for what Mr Fiori proceeded to say shows that what Mr Poettering expresses here is not the view of the Christian Democrat members, but only the opinion of some of them.
Madam President, I did not hear your radio and television statement myself, but many of those who were able to do so said that you had taken up an excellent position on behalf of the European Parliament in respect of Mr Berlusconi's remarks and have told me emphatically that Mrs Fontaine's position is exactly that which the European Parliament should take up.
Let me first congratulate you on it.
I would, though, also like to ask you to do the following: as your position is visibly the majority view of this House, you should again expressly communicate this position to Mr Berlusconi and, at the same time, ask him - in order to dispel any doubt - to make a statement in reply.
For if his cultural relativism were really nothing but a misunderstanding, your letter and an appropriate response from Mr Berlusconi would be decidedly helpful.
Mr Schulz, I shall certainly send Mr Berlusconi my press release of 11 September, as well as the statement that I made on 19 September following the meeting that I gave.
The Arab League ambassadors had wanted to meet me personally in order to outline their concerns to me and, at the end of this important meeting, which was both intense and worthwhile, I made a statement that could not be any clearer.
I shall also send my statement of 22 September, declaring that the European Council is firmly committed to the fight against terrorism, and in which I solemnly confirm the European Union' s commitment to protecting democratic and multicultural societies.
And lastly, I shall forward my speech that Mrs Banotti referred to, which I gave to the Heads of State at the exceptional meeting of the Heads of State and Government, and which is very clear.
I could also add the statements that I made on Greek television, as I was on an official visit to Greece at that time.
Madam President, in my opinion, the words of the Italian Prime Minister have been misinterpreted by some, and exploited for internal political ends by others who have even used the platform of the European Parliament to exploit them for the purposes of European politics.
Over 200 Members of this Parliament from the European People' s Party took part in the convention in Rome, which included the meeting with the Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, and they can testify that Mr Berlusconi outlined the government' s positions and his own personal position on terrorism and the Middle East crisis.
The members of the European People' s Party who do not belong to our coalition government in Italy can also confirm what the Italian Prime Minister' s views are. They are not those reported by certain newspapers nor those described by the left in this House.
(Interruption by Mr Schultz)
Mr Schultz, I did not interrupt you. I would ask you at least to be polite.
Clearly, politeness was not part of your education. Please would you refrain from interrupting and learn some manners above all.
Why are you getting so het up?
Madam President, rather than concerning himself with the internal affairs of the European People' s Party, Mr Schultz would do well to concentrate on those of his own group, which has a minority in Parliament and lost the elections in Italy.
Clearly, this irritable behaviour is evidence of the political difficulties currently being experienced by his group.
Madam President, the Italian Prime Minister has made a very practical proposal, and I would like the European Parliament to express its opinion on this matter.
As I said before, the hundreds of Members of the European Parliament from the European People' s Party who were present at Rome can testify to this.
The proposal is for an incisive European Union economic intervention to support the Palestinian people, so that the economic growth of the Palestinian people can contribute to reducing existing political tension.
This is a subject for debate, a practical proposal made by the Italian Prime Minister to protect and defend the Palestinian people, who are experiencing economically difficult times, in the clear knowledge that it is only by defusing the crisis in the Middle East that the world crisis can be resolved.
And the Italian Prime Minister met with both Israelis and Palestinians.
I would like the Socialist Party to discuss this subject in this House rather than disseminating election propaganda.
The left-wing democrats are in trouble.
Madam President, the left-wing Members appear to be extremely restless.
As I said, they should discuss practical matters rather than using the European Parliament as a vehicle for political and election propaganda.
In Italy, the citizens decided: the centre-right won. Silvio Berlusconi is Prime Minister and the left has lost.
Madam President, I do not wish to reply to Mr Tajani, but only to make two observations.
I had not interrupted him, but had listened attentively and - which is exceptional for me - had permitted myself to laugh at the particularly clever things he said.
God forbid that that should be prohibited in this House!
Perhaps the situation in Italy has got so that one is no longer permitted to laugh at the government...
I had not interrupted him, and must moreover say that it would not have been worth it to break into his disquisition.
Madam President, on a point of order.
Following the tragedies in New York and Washington, many other aspects of our lives have inevitably been changed for ever and I would like to ask the Commission to make a statement on the issue of state aids to airlines.
In a small peripheral country such as my own, the survival of a national airline is of vital importance to the economy and already in Ireland over 700 jobs are threatened at Aer Lingus.
I would ask the Commission to lift its ban on state aids to national, particularly small, airlines.
Certainly, Mrs Banotti, thank you for what you said and we shall pass on your request to the Commission.
Madam President, Mrs Banotti has already raised the matter of the effect of the acts of terrorism on airlines.
It is more than airlines: the European tourism industry is Europe's biggest industry, and the World Travel and Tourism Council estimates at the present time that two million jobs could be lost in Europe.
This is a very serious matter.
I hope the Commission and Council can address this and come forward with some proposals to try and alleviate the situation, because it could be quite drastic.
I have just returned from the United States where hotel accommodation is currently about 20% of capacity and aircraft are operating at between 25 and 33% of capacity.
There has been a huge reaction and I hope the Council and, in particular, the Commission can do something to help before matters get really serious in Europe.
Madam President, I have a point of order on the aviation industry in Europe, and in particular the national airline in Ireland which will be bankrupt within a matter of weeks unless the Commission relaxes its guidelines on state aid for the airline industries.
There is also a former state company in Ireland, now privately owned, which services and maintains airlines.
This company is also in serious difficulty.
As Mr Provan mentioned, the tourism industry is in further severe difficulty too after the crisis which followed the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.
I appeal to you, Madam President, to use your good offices to impress upon the Commission the concern of this House about the impact of the atrocities of 11 September in Europe where thousands, if not millions, of jobs are at risk.
It is extremely important, if this House is to demonstrate its relevance to the lives of the citizens of Europe, that we should use our influence to save these jobs and to ensure that the Commission does not apply rigid, ideologically-based guidelines in the current situation.
Mr De Rossa, this is an extremely important issue and I shall of course forward this message to the Commission.
Mrs Wallström might also wish to give a brief response.
Madam President, of course this has already been discussed at a Commission meeting.
The Commission has been in contact with European and other airlines and there have been discussions about state aid or insurance and how these should be channelled.
I have to refer the matter to my colleague, Commissioner de Palacio, who will have all the details and can give you more information, but I assure you this has definitely been on our agenda and we are interested in finding a solution.
I will raise this issue with my colleagues in the Commission and I hope we can give you, as soon as possible, a complete answer to questions about the airlines and state aid, or help through other channels.
Thank you, Mrs Wallström.
I would also point out that the communication refers to the guidelines for trans-European transport networks and so this issue might also be dealt with tomorrow, when we are given the Commission communication.
Madam President, unfortunately most people have left at this stage but I want to draw the House's attention to the murder by loyalist paramilitaries last Friday of Martin O'Hagan, a journalist.
This is just one more example of the grave human rights situation in Northern Ireland.
Human rights lawyers have been assassinated as well by loyalist paramilitaries.
Only a few years ago, Rosemarie Nelson, the mother of a young family, was assassinated by loyalist paramilitaries because she was a human rights lawyer.
There is a serious matter.
We often debate resolutions in this House about human rights lawyers and journalists being assassinated in the exercise of their duty in other parts of the world.
Here is a situation within the European Union that has been going on for a long time.
The situation is extremely grave.
Journalists have the right to expose wrongdoings, human rights lawyers have the right enshrined in international law to represent people in courts.
Yet they are being prevented from doing so and in fact, those brave enough to do so have lost their lives.
It is a real tragedy.
Thank you, Mrs McKenna, for having added to what I said at the opening of the sitting.
Accident at AZF, Toulouse, and EU environmental policy
The next item is the Commission statement on the accident at the AZF factory in Toulouse and the rewriting of the European Union' s environmental protection policy.
I shall now give the floor to Mrs Wallström.
Madam President, the accident in Toulouse occurred shortly after 10 a.m. on 21 September at the establishment Grande Paroisse in Toulouse.
This fertiliser plant is owned by Atofina the chemical branch of the Total/Fina/Elf group.
Amongst other dangerous substances it held important quantities of liquefied ammonia and chlorine, combustibles, solid ammonium nitrate and fertilisers, as well as methanol.
The effects of what seems to have been a mass explosion of ammonium nitrate were felt far outside the establishment's boundaries.
According to the latest reports, 29 people were killed, 30 people are still in hospital in a serious condition and in total around 2400 people were injured.
The accident also affected two other chemical plants in the vicinity.
It rendered a large number of houses uninhabitable and affected the electricity distribution system.
Moreover, the psychological after-effects on the population that first believed it to be a terrorist attack are also important.
This accident is perhaps the worst of its kind in Europe since 1921, when an explosion at the BASF company in Germany claimed the lives of 561 citizens.
Last week a representative of the Total/Fina/Elf group met with the responsible services of my Directorate-General in order to provide detailed information on the accident.
Furthermore, the French Ministry of the Environment has provided information to the Commission.
However, the exact causes of the accident are still unknown and the three investigations under way by Atofina, the Ministry of the Environment and the Attorney-General might take a long time.
AZF was fully covered by the Seveso II directive, which aims at the prevention of major industrial accidents and the limitation of their consequences for man and the environment.
Its classical field of application are chemical plants and storage facilities.
The directive obliges the operator of these facilities to put in place a major accident prevention policy, a safety management system and internal emergency plans.
He/she has to prepare a safety report and send it to the public control authorities.
These authorities have the task of inspecting the site at regular intervals and also of ensuring that its external emergency plans are put in place and tested periodically.
Furthermore, the public living in the vicinity of the plant must be informed of the risks arising from the facility and the behaviour in case of an accident.
The directive came into force in 1999 and replaced the original Seveso directive from 1982 that was adopted following major industrial accidents in the 1970s.
This was the first piece of Community legislation in the field of industrial risk management.
It is no secret that Member States were late with their transposition of the Seveso II directive into national law.
No Member State adopted transposition legislation in time or notified the Commission hereof in time.
Therefore the Commission started infringement proceedings against all 15 Member States for non-communication or incomplete communication of transposition measures.
In the meantime this resulted in the Commission taking five Member States to the European Court of Justice: Belgium, Austria, Germany, Ireland and Portugal.
For France, the Commission decided on 18 July 2001 to apply to the Court for incomplete transposition.
However, I want to make it very clear today that the reasons for the Court appeal being launched against France can in no way be related directly to the Toulouse accident in terms of possible infringement of obligations under the Seveso II directive.
At the moment, despite rumours in the press, the Commission has no indication that there was either a deficiency on behalf of the operator managing the plant and complying with Seveso II or on behalf of the French control authorities responsible for inspecting the site.
According to information received from the French Minister for the Environment, risk analysis, including possible accident scenarios, had been carried out by the site operator but these did not include a mass explosion of ammonia nitrate.
The last updates were made in 2000 and 2001.
A safety management system was in place and the site was inspected about twice a year.
The last inspection took place in May 2001.
Internal and external emergency plans were in place.
A land use planning policy established by the prefect imposed restrictions on all new construction activities in the vicinity of the plant.
Let me now come to the follow-up.
Just over a week after the accident it is still too early to draw any conclusions.
The regulatory committee established under the Seveso II directive, chaired by the Commission and composed of representatives of all Member States is going to meet on 10-12 October to discuss, amongst other things, the accident and its follow-up.
What is the repercussion of the Toulouse accident on the foreseen amendment of the Seveso II directive?
You might recall that after the Baia Mare accident, the cyanide spill in Romania in January 2000, I created a task force that presented its final report in December last year.
In parallel, after the disastrous fireworks explosion in May 2000 in Enschede in the Netherlands, my services organised two European expert seminars on pyrotechnic and explosive substances.
The expertise and the resulting recommendations went into a draft proposal for an amendment to the Seveso II directive, aiming at broadening the scope and covering establishments that were previously not covered.
The draft proposal has undergone a public consultation process involving all stakeholders and was foreseen for adoption by the Commission in September.
We should move forward with this amendment.
This does not mean we should not take due account of the Toulouse accident.
There is indeed one very important aspect that made the consequences of the accidents in Toulouse and Enschede even worse, that is, the proximity of the establishments to inhabited areas.
The new Article 12 on land use planning in the Seveso II directive aims in the long term at the separation of hazardous industrial establishments and inhabited areas or other locations frequented by the public.
Although the inclusion of such a provision in Community legislation for the very first time represents a major step forward, the Commission and Member States still have to gain experience with its implementation.
Moreover, this provision applies to the planning for new industrial sites, for new housing zones, and does not retroactively apply to existing situations, such as Toulouse, where increasing density of population has led residential areas to continually spread closer to an industrial site that has existed since the 1920s.
In order to assist Member States with the implementation of this provision, a guidance document on land use planning was published in 1999 and plans for a European seminar on land use planning to be hosted by France were already under way before the accident in Toulouse.
In the near future my services will increase cooperation with the Member States in order to develop an appropriate legislative and/or non-legislative follow-up to the accidents in the areas of land use planning, harmonisation of generic risk assessment methods and risk mapping.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 21 September, Toulouse was struck by a terrible disaster which, as Mrs Wallström said, claimed many victims - 29 people died and more than 2 000 people were injured - and considerable damage was caused to housing, schools, hospitals and universities.
If I may, I would like to pay tribute to the victims and to express our sympathy and support to the injured, to their families and to all those affected by this disaster.
What helps most in a disaster like this is other people expressing their solidarity.
The people of Toulouse have been touched by the number and by the spontaneity of the messages that they have received from France and the European Union, from the Parliament and the Commission.
As Deputy Mayor of Toulouse, I would like to give my sincere thanks to all those who have sent these messages to us.
This disaster also compels us to consider a number of things. The first is the action the European Union can take to help these towns or regions affected by the catastrophe.
The European Union budget used to include a heading for emergency aid to deal with these disasters, but this was withdrawn.
I am today requesting that this instrument, which helped to put affected regions back on their feet, be re-introduced.
Toulouse is a prime example of a European city with its aircraft and space industries and, in the last few days, I have heard many people asking, when they hear of aid being granted by various sources: 'And what about Europe - what is Europe doing to help us?'
Since we constantly discuss bringing Europe closer to its people, one of the most obvious ways of doing this would be for Europe to help Europeans in their time of need.
Situations such as that which Toulouse has recently experienced require the use of human resources, such as the fire services, first-aid workers, doctors, hospital and voluntary staff.
Without going so far as to propose the utopia of a European civil protection force, I think that every effort should be made at European Union level, as Parliament recently requested, to enhance the coordination of civil protection expenditure.
We must improve how the system works.
For example, in the disaster in Toulouse, I would have been pleased to see the fire services and first-aid workers from other Member States supporting the remarkable work carried out by the Toulouse fire services.
These are distressing circumstances, admittedly, but this would have done much to help Europe' s cause.
We often talk of 'zero risk' .
The recent events, which have plunged the citizens of Toulouse and New York into mourning, show that this certainly cannot be achieved.
What we can do, however, is to reduce the probability of risk by taking careful action.
We must do this at a local level, at a national level, and we must ensure this is done at European level.
I therefore call on the European Commission to take into account the lessons of the disaster in Toulouse when revising the Seveso II directive.
Almost every day, many demonstrations take place in Toulouse, in which thousands of people take part, chanting 'Never again, never again!'
I would like everyone in this House to respond to them with 'Never again in Europe!'
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I begin talking about the substance of the matter, I would naturally like to express my solidarity with the victims and their families.
I believe that the House has today shown its solidarity, which, in my view, is also essential.
Secondly, my thoughts are also with those of my fellow Members who are more directly involved, due to their responsibilities in the region.
Nor should we forget to praise the efficiency of everyone who immediately rushed to the scene of the disaster to provide assistance, such as the fire services and hospital staff, and of everyone who played a part in organising the support network for the victims and their families.
We must also praise the extensive measures of solidarity announced by the Prime Minister during his visit last Friday to Toulouse, which will enable life to return to a normal footing - if that were at all possible - by re-housing those who have lost their homes and getting children back into school as quickly as possible.
There is also an inquiry underway into the causes of the explosion.
We must have confidence in the French authorities to carry out this inquiry carefully, with a desire for transparency and with a determination to succeed.
In addition to this, what can we do at European level?
In my view, we must all shoulder our responsibilities, at our own level.
You mentioned this, Commissioner, and I would like to thank you for your comments about France' s responsibility concerning its obligations under the Seveso directive.
What you said is important.
You also mentioned the debate that is underway on how to best reconcile land use planning, environmental risk, industrial risk and employment.
The work that you have carried out with the aim of revising the Seveso directive should take into account every aspect of this balance.
Many other Members, in addition to myself, will take part in this debate on additional measures which could be envisaged, including at a European level, particularly with regard to monitoring.
There is, nonetheless, a point that I would like to come back to, which is the issue of emergency aid.
Admittedly, we all know that this is a difficult debate, one that was opened during the re-negotiation of Agenda 2000.
But can we just sit back and watch the disasters that have struck France - namely, the sinking of the Erika, the storms of December 1999 and now the explosion in Toulouse - without demonstrating some European solidarity?
We must find a way to do this, if not through the use of a heading on emergency aid, perhaps we could see whether there is some leeway within the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) so that, in addition to this strict set of zones that we have put in place, there may be room for a small solidarity package, so that Europe can also manage in difficult circumstances.
Secondly, I hope that the Commissioner will do everything she can at a European level and beyond to remind everyone of their responsibilities, in order to allow land planning policies to take into account, in their fiscal dimension as well, the difficult balance that we must achieve, and also so that the leaders of industry shoulder their responsibilities when compensating victims and repairing the damage.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I would like to join previous speakers in expressing my group' s solidarity with the families, the victims' relatives and the people of Toulouse as a whole.
Given the latest legal information we have at our disposal, and whilst awaiting completion of the inquiry that is currently underway, which will determine the causes of the disaster, what lessons, Mr President, can we draw from this fatal explosion?
First of all - and this is distressing, truly distressing - history is repeating itself.
It is 33 years since the Seveso disaster, not to mention the other disasters that have occurred, and two European directives seeking to provide the Member States with a harmonised policy in managing major industrial risks will not have been enough to avoid another human tragedy.
This is a stark reality that illustrates the limits of a law, even where this is binding and transnational.
We should avoid responding to this industrial catastrophe with a Seveso III directive.
The Liberals consider it imperative, and the Commissioner reiterated this, that, first and foremost, all Member States strictly apply the provisions of the existing legislation, particularly the Seveso II directive, which dates back to December 1996.
And we still have a long way to go before this can be done, with infringement proceedings launched against six Member States, one of which is France.
You also stated, Mrs Wallström, that all Member States were behind in the transposition of the directive into national law.
So, did the manufacturer, the owner of the site, update the safety report at any point in the last five years, as specifically laid down in one of the articles under the Seveso II directive?
It is worthwhile asking this question, since at a seminar held in France in 1999, the European Union network for the implementation and enforcement of environmental law (Impel) discussed the causes of a massive ammonia leak at the 'Grande Paroisse' factory, which is in the Seveso II category, and the finger of blame was pointed at design faults and equipment reliability.
We must conclude that the precautionary principle did not prevail in this case.
Must we reiterate that this risk assessment provides an essential basis for any strategy to prevent and avert all types of disaster?
And now I come to the key point of this debate, which is, as Mrs Berès has already said, the monitoring of land use planning in areas surrounding these sites.
Employees of the factory are of course affected but everyone living nearby is also a victim of the massive chemical explosion.
The AZF factory was nothing more and nothing less than a time bomb situated less than five kilometres from the centre of Toulouse, a city with a population of 400 000.
This is not the only example of a city in Europe that has seen a population explosion.
If you draw two lines on a map of Europe, one from London to Milan and the other from Copenhagen to Barcelona, and 200 kilometre corridors along each side of the lines of this X, you will have 65% of Europe' s population and 80% of Europe' s manufacturing sites, including the dangerous ones, within this restricted area.
In France, there is a national debate on the issue of risks to the urban population.
Three hundred and sixty million citizens of Europe expect, here and now, to see a genuine land planning policy resulting from the unprecedented disaster that struck Toulouse.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all the speakers who have taken part in this debate, as I believe that, despite our political differences, we know that we must pull together in the face of tragedy.
Mrs Wallström, the title of the statement that you made to us today obviously referred to the accident at the AZF factory, but it also referred to the rewriting of the European Union' s environmental protection policy because, in my view, this is what poses the challenge.
The accident that occurred at Seveso gave us the Seveso I directive.
This was insufficient.
The accident at Bopal was followed by the Seveso II directive.
I do not wish to see us simply come up with a third Seveso directive, a point that my fellow Member, Mrs Ries, made very well.
In my view, we must change the way we approach these problems as patching up after each successive tragedy can only achieve so much.
Obviously, I agree that we need to further strengthen what already exists, but we must also know when to change tack.
Since today we know that 'zero risk' is impossible - what has happened recently illustrates this, tragically - and so it is also impossible for people to live alongside a chemical time bomb.
We must therefore move away from risk management towards risk removal.
The removal of risk will not be an easy thing to achieve, let us make no bones about this.
We will not be able to do everything in one fell swoop.
Several things will need to be implemented. First of all, we need resources.
European resources, resources from other Member States, which will be crucial and which must obviously supplement the resources that the manufacturers themselves will have to provide, because these large international firms are making a profit, because the land that they own, due to their proximity to built-up areas, is worth a great deal on the property market, and also because if they relocate, they will undergo restructuring and will make substantial operational savings.
We need resources, therefore, but we must also avoid causing social problems.
Over the past few days, the people who worked at the AZF factory have been burying their colleagues.
I do not wish to add unemployment to their list of problems - let us not add social crisis and social problems to the environmental and human tragedy.
We therefore must use all our resources to help these people to relocate if the site is sealed off, or help them with retraining if jobs are retained in Toulouse.
We must also be very careful with regard to relocation.
The European Union has always been very sensitive to the question of solidarity and I believe that the large corporations are quite prepared to relocate, but they can quite easily contemplate relocating to the developing world, where there is no environmental protection and no social protection.
In this respect as well, the European Union must make every effort to avoid this type of relocation.
Let us avoid sending our time bombs and dangers to other parts of the world.
Lastly, now might be a good time, when discussing relocations, to consider the purpose of the products that are manufactured in the companies concerned.
The factory that exploded produced fertilisers.
Is there still a need today for us to flush more nitrates into the groundwater of Europe' s soil?
It may also be the time to question whether some production methods are not perhaps obsolete.
I am calling upon you, Mrs Wallström, and via you I call on the Commission as a whole, because it is Europe' s turn to speak.
Defining this general framework clearly falls within Europe' s remit.
Due to the scale, frequency and almost unavoidable nature of these accidents, I believe that a pact of confidence has been breached between the people of Europe and the regulatory framework that we are supposed to implement.
I think that we must restore this confidence as a matter of urgency.
We are, I believe, now awaiting specific and firm proposals from the Commission.
We should not be satisfied with purely cosmetic measures.
We need political measures.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like other Members from the region, I was in Toulouse at the time of the explosion.
Since then, I have met with several employees, residents and friends who have been affected by this disaster.
I wish to point out that when we talk about suffering, trauma and shock, we are talking about men and women whose lives have been deeply wounded and their anger is in proportion to this shock.
I wish to pay tribute to the memory of the victims and also to the local authority workers, the emergency and medical teams, the Electricité de France employees and all the men and women who, with their skills and goodwill, gave their energies to serve the general interest.
It is also at times like this that we rediscover the importance of public services and their staff as a tool for serving the general interest.
Many political leaders have spoken of the absurdity of locating this type of chemical plant near to large urban centres.
It is worth making the point that wherever this type of industry is located, there are men and women working.
In a far-off desert or in the centre of Brussels, if the factory blows up, scores of workers will lose their lives.
The first question we should address is that of making these industries as safe as possible.
Admittedly, the debate on the location of sites has been opened, but this aspect cannot be considered unless there are major improvements in inspection and safety conditions.
The entire situation has changed.
It is my view that the Seveso directives need to be reviewed.
Let us use what we learn from this disaster to improve regulations on safety and on respecting the environment.
We must come up with new, much more restrictive regulations on the way these plants are run and, above all, on the resources available to inspection bodies.
By way of anecdote, a terrifying one, the inspection body responsible for the Midi-Pyrénées region has 17 inspectors to inspect over 2000 companies.
Amongst the first factors thrown up by the investigation, I know that the investigation is not over, but nevertheless, there are many indications that the company' s management took a rather irresponsible approach to risk management.
We must draw the obvious conclusions from that.
Following the disaster, we are discovering serious safety lapses in the chemical industry in other parts of the country.
This review process must be undertaken in tandem with a mission whose work is open to the whole of Europe and which has the task of carrying out an assessment of European safety.
Inspection bodies must publish their results.
The investigation in Toulouse must be transparent and must involve employees and local residents.
I therefore call on Parliament to state its support for an exceptional risk assessment procedure in Europe and to review the directives.
Toulouse is today a city in shock, in terms of the physical environment, psychologically and in terms of the direct and indirect consequences for employment and for businesses located near the site.
Toulouse needs financial and logistical aid.
The Union must demonstrate its capacity for solidarity at times of crisis.
Will this require exceptional emergency funds?
I am not sure, but the European Commission could, for example, contact the city, the département and the region to sound out their logistical needs.
In this situation, the mobilisation of European engineers and support teams could, in symbolic terms as well as being effective, demonstrate the commitment of the European Union.
'Never again!'
'Never again!' is what tens of thousands of Toulouse' s citizens are shouting and calling for.
'Never again!' was what the communities affected by the oil slick from the Erika shipwreck, demanded.
Once again, the approach of profit, job cuts and investment has led to a lapse in safety and has caused an ecological and human disaster.
In order to confront this, we need further public regulation, more rules on inspection and more resources.
We know that people are initially angry with the company' s bosses, but they will turn on us next and this fury will be unleashed on us, the political leaders.
And they would be right to do so. Our task is to produce rules that benefit the community, not to bow down to the dominance of private interests.
Mr President, as our fellow Member, Mrs De Veyrac, deputy Mayor of Toulouse, sadly stated, on 21 September 2001, the ammonium nitrate warehouse in the AZF chemical factory in Toulouse exploded, causing the death of 29 people and injuring 2 500.
A disaster of this scale requires the competent authorities to provide information on the exact causes of the explosion, out of respect for the victims, their families, and for all communities living near a site with a Seveso classification.
Was this an accident, a malicious act or a terrorist attack?
Before accusing the chemical industry of failing to comply with the precautionary principle, let us consider the results found by the chemists and specialists in ammonium nitrate, which confirm that there is no basis for the theory of a gradual decomposition of the product that caused the explosion.
Ammonium nitrate is a stable product, and the investigators make the point that this type of product cannot explode unless it comes into contact with intense heat, as proven by the very serious precedents in Silesia in 1921, in Texas in 1947, in Brest, in France, in 1947.
Furthermore, the staff representatives at the AZF plant vigorously repudiate the description of a sink-factory.
Whatever the cause, it would be wise to produce a list of the most dangerous sites and to relocate them away from housing.
On the other hand, it is, of course, inconceivable to prohibit by law the establishment of high-risk chemical industrial plants.
These would be forced to locate abroad with foreseeable consequences for the economy and business confidence.
We would certainly have to amend European legislation which, although dating from 1982 and 1996, is not retroactive.
We would have to increase the vigilance of inspection services and authorities over industrial sites with a Seveso classification, or even make access to dangerous sites more secure.
The approach to adopt will depend on the outcome of the investigation, which we hope will be completed with complete frankness.
Mr President, I would like to join other Members in expressing my condolences to the families involved in the tragedy that has taken place.
I also share some of the opinions of previous speakers.
I would like to insist on one point, however: I believe that the system based on prohibition, the Seveso system, is not sufficient.
The tragedies taking place recently are demonstrating that we are experiencing phenomena which can only be reduced, if not eliminated, by means of integrated treatment.
The issue today is town and country planning.
Europe has an old and antiquated system in which all towns wanted to have their industries and it seemed that quality of life was linked to everything being together.
A town with many shops, many industries and all within an accessible area.
Nevertheless, the scale, the risk and the dimension of our companies today demonstrate the serious problems that this entails.
We cannot continue to allow town and country planning to be completely subsidiary.
We must be capable of selecting basic elements in order to create a European area of security, in the way that is being done in other areas, such as food safety.
We must recognise the need for an area of security in the field of town and country planning.
And the countries must accept it.
And in the same way that any town and country planning accepts protected natural areas, measures of this type will also have to be accepted.
In this respect, I regret the fact that, in the version of the environmental action programme which we have received from the Council - the sixth - with regard to which we presented proposals on the urban environment and inhabited areas, certain aspects have been removed which our group considers important.
We believe that it is a matter of urgency to establish environmental strategies, to implement risk studies, also in industrial areas, to create specific industrial areas far from towns, to penalise those builders or local authorities who allow anything for the sake of construction, and of course establish risk indicators which are incorporated into a European policy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like us, through our fellow Members from Toulouse who are with us today, starting with the President of the sitting, to express our condolences and our solidarity with all the victims of the tragedy in Toulouse.
I, like other speakers, would also like to pay special tribute to the marvellous chain of emergency aid workers, both professional and voluntary, that was put together in Toulouse and, in particular, to the enormous dignity shown by the people of Toulouse in these extremely difficult circumstances.
What happened there is unimaginable.
The death toll is indeed terrible, but is much lower than it might have been, given the unbelievable force of the explosion and the huge damage caused by this explosion in a heavily populated area.
I agree with Mr Onesta when he says that, since there is no such thing as zero risk, especially in industry, we must now take stock and change our approach.
In other words, we must apply the precautionary principle in land use planning.
This means, whenever possible - and it will, unfortunately, only be possible in very limited cases - relocating businesses that are at risk, whilst protecting jobs.
This is a concern that other speakers have also expressed. It would be particularly unfair for workers in industry to face an added risk - a social risk, that of losing their job - in addition to risks at work.
The problem is also, and, perhaps, mainly, one of controlling urban development because, and we must be honest about this, in many cases, residential areas have merged with industrial areas.
Near to the site in Toulouse, there was a major shopping centre.
In my municipality, which has a factory just like the one in Toulouse, building permits are still being issued for communal housing, less than 800 metres from the site.
Mainly, Commissioner, I would say that the draft amendment to the Seveso II directive must take account of these problems of urban growth, not least by increasing the responsibilities of businesses but also of the elected authorities that issue building permits.
Lastly, I should like to echo the feeling of helplessness that I experience as a Member of the European Parliament every time that we have the misfortune to encounter this type of event.
The European Union does not do all it can when faced with disasters of this scale.
Every time we give the commitment to move closer to the citizens of Europe, we must remember that we are not there when they go through distressing or intensely emotional times.
I asked Commissioner Barnier this question after the storms in 1999, and it has come back to haunt us.
I know that the credit line has been discontinued, but since this is the case, let us at least imagine the Utopia, as Mrs de Veyrac said, of a Eurocorps for civil defence, which is happening for the army.
In other words, a rapid action force could also quite easily exist in the field of civil defence.
For years we have been warning about risks of accident. For years we have been afraid that a disaster would happen and for years we have fought against the establishment of these plants in the Toulouse area.
And now, when the explosion occurs, we have the sudden shock that stunned us at a distance of twenty kilometres, the contradictory information, the toxic cloud, a prefect who is asking to have his house proofed for leaks, all the windows shattered, the reflex to go and pick one' s children up from school, the anguish of seeing cars upside down, windscreens shattered, bloodied drivers wearing masks, the joy of finding one' s daughters, terrified and sheltering in the only classrooms whose windows remain in tact, relieved to see us.
Going home, unable to telephone, no means of communication and finally hearing about friends who are in shock, injured or in hospital.
Then, after the anguish, the fear and after the suffering comes the time for anger.
More than 5 000 of us gathered on the streets of Toulouse on Tuesday and more than 30 000 on Saturday, all shouting 'Never again' .
The disaster in Toulouse is hugely revealing.
First of all, it shows the limitations of local democracy and, in particular, of land use planning policies.
Town councils have not used their land use plans to keep residential or commercial areas away from danger.
There is no safety programme in place.
There has been no consultation with local associations or with residents, despite the dangers.
Locally elected representatives are equally responsible for what has happened.
The disaster also lays bare the policy of industrialists who, for the sake of profit, make not only their employees run risks, but also the surrounding community.
Lastly, the disaster has shown up the loopholes in the Seveso directive and in the policies implemented by the European Union.
This disaster has shown the limitations of risk management policy.
An overhaul of European legislation is essential.
We can no longer put up with the existence of such huge risks.
We must have a risk prevention policy.
The legal liability of industry in the event of an accident must be better defined and increased.
Member States must transpose European Union directives, and also comply with existing directives on environmental protection.
The liability of policymakers must also be confirmed.
Inspections must be stepped up and the responsibility of inspectors, who must be trained to European standards, must also be laid down.
Chemical as well as nuclear bombs are located near to most European cities and yet no assessment of the risks has been made.
I do not want to play the role of Cassandra, but I would not wish anyone to experience what we in Toulouse went through on 21 September.
My thoughts go to the victims of the explosion, to the men and women who died working at the AZF factory in Toulouse and who join the ranks of all those who die every day in a work-related accident because their companies have given priority to profit over safety.
My thoughts also go to the men and women who died in the street or at home because the government and the town hall did not want to impose the necessary measures to ensure that the factory was not a bomb waiting to go off, a danger to everyone working there and to everyone who lived nearby.
Whatever the initial cause of the explosion, it is unacceptable that it should have turned into such a disaster, all because precautions were not taken.
To bring down costs, expenditure on maintenance and storage was reduced, jobs were cut and with complete disregard for safety, work was given to sub-contractors who employed under-trained temporary staff.
The TotalFinaElf Corporation, which already bears guilt for the Erika shipwreck, is fully responsible.
Putting the requirements of profit before those of safety is a crime. It is murder and the authorities that have allowed this to happen share the guilt for this event.
TotalFinaElf, which last year made the greatest profit ever seen by a French company, has the cynicism to toss FRF 20 million to the victims to cover damages that are estimated at FRF 8 billion at the very least. Not to mention the pain of the victims' families, which cannot be compensated for.
The material damage must be paid for in full by the Elf Corporation and above all, this must never happen again, in Toulouse or anywhere else in France, or Europe.
This will require very strict inspection measures for these types of companies, with the participation of the workers and under their supervision.
Mr President, the Erika, storms, Toulouse, I hope that we will not have to add Carling to the list, a chemical plant that is 50 km from here as the crow flies and near to my home in Lorraine.
How many more deadly signs do we need, Commissioner, before we agree to discuss our society' s future? Our society is adrift, like a wayward ship set to a faulty automatic pilot.
Are we still going to accept as inevitable, in the name of employment and the all-powerful economy that communities should continue to live at risk, as they do in Toulouse and elsewhere?
Were these communities informed of the risks that they faced?
It would appear not.
On the other hand, the communities that are aware of the risks, with ecologists at the top of the list, have been calling for drastic measures for years, such as improving factory safety and of course, the closure of the most dangerous ones.
Unfortunately, in Toulouse, the worst imaginable scenario occurred.
Of course, no chemical factory, no nuclear power plant, particularly following 11 September and the appalling terrorist attack on the United States will be out of bounds, the appalling now having become possible.
This must by no means prevent our countries, with the European Union leading the way, from being able to adopt the measures necessary to guarantee the citizens the highest level of safety in their workplace and in their everyday lives.
The Seveso I directive represented a huge step forwards.
Seveso II is an improvement on this but has yet to prove itself, since it has not yet been fully implemented.
The investigation will tell us whether, in Toulouse, its provisions were being implemented, but this looks unlikely.
Did those responsible not consider such a disaster to be highly improbable?
What Europe needs today is more than just a Seveso III.
First of all, however, I hope that we do not give in to populism by giving the impression that with one wave of a wand, we could transfer these high-risk factories to another place, a more distant and safer place.
No high-risk factories should be relocated to developing countries, in the same way that it would be a mistake to consider transplanting these factories into the countryside.

Secondly, specific industrial sites must be defined, while - let us remember, Commissioner - large amounts of money and European funds have been provided to regenerate industrial wasteland and convert some of it into theme parks. It would have been more appropriate to use these places to build factories with stricter regulations.
Thirdly, it is absolutely crucial that the Commission present, as rapidly as possible, its draft directive on environmental responsibility, which is the only solution that will force negligent or even unwilling factory owners to comply with restrictive regulations.
Lastly, we need to ask: what kind of society do we want to build?
If we carry on as we are, we will be authorising production of chemical molecules whose impact on health or potential risks when transported or manufactured we do not know.
This is our social model, which must be completely changed in order to guarantee future generations a life free from terrible accidents and danger.
Mr President, the Total/Fina/Elf group is already guilty of committing a crime against the environment through the shipwreck of the oil tanker Erika and has acted criminally, once again, with the explosion of the AZF factory in Toulouse: 29 people are dead, more than 2 500 injured and a whole community ravaged.
Like my fellow speakers, I fully share the pain of all men and women in Toulouse and most particularly, the pain of the victims' families.
It is our duty, however, to ensure that everything is done to clarify responsibilities.
First of all, the responsibilities of TotalFinaElf, who allowed the stored fertiliser to turn into a chemical bomb by cutting costs on production, inspections and safety.
TotalFinaElf must pay.
It must compensate the victims and guarantee the salaries of its employees given that it has the cheek to announce aid for the community that totals one year' s salary for just one employee: its managing director.
Next, there is the responsibility of the public authorities, the local council which, for the sake of business taxes, allowed a chemical plant to exist in a working class residential area.
Also the government itself, which waited until 1999 to implement the Seveso II directive, which was voted for in 1996, and was a clearly inadequate directive.
Legislation must be strengthened and its implementation must be verified by independent inspectors from within the public service.
The safety of people and the environment is too serious a matter to be left to shareholders and speculators.
It is for communities, employees, unions and workers' associations to determine, through a public and democratic debate, which types of production are socially useful or are considered to be too dangerous.
This kind of choice cannot be left to the discretion of people who have proved to be unable to guarantee people' s safety.
It is the responsibility of a public system of management, under the control of the community at large and the employees.
Let us not allow the law of profit to pollute and murder again.
Indeed, Never again!
Mr President, firstly I have to remind you that we do not yet know the exact causes and the series of events.
It is estimated that it may be a year before we know all the details relating to the causes of this accident.
It is important to remember that first of all we have to look at exactly what happened and what caused this terrible accident in Toulouse.
Secondly, I would like to talk about responsibility, which, first and foremost, lies with the operators of hazardous facilities.
Legislation cannot solve all of these problems.
Responsibility here has to be clarified - and it lies with the operators of this plant.
One of the basic problems is the so-called urban sprawl - the problem of land use planning.
This plant was established in the 1920s.
As you know, the Seveso II directive concerns new facilities, as well as the rules on informing the public, etc. You also know that this is an extremely sensitive issue with the Member States, and until now responsibility for land use planning has rested at national, regional and local level.
This is, then, a very sensitive issue and we are not yet empowered to take decisions on all relevant aspects.
So what can and must we do in a situation like this?
We have to ensure that our legislation is updated and try to make provision for and anticipate the improvements required to our legislation in order to prevent these accidents from happening again, although we are aware that we will never be able to prevent all accidents.
Unfortunately, we will probably be faced with accidents again, but everything we can do we must do.
That is why, once we have established the causes of this accident, we will also enter into an open and transparent process of consultation and discussion with Member States and with all involved stakeholders in order to see what we can do to improve our existing directives and make them more effective in trying to prevent this type of accident.
We should also move ahead with what is already on the table - the amended Seveso II directive - because of previous accidents.
We should not delay in moving forward with the amended directive, but we should definitely be involved in following up this accident to ensure that we have done everything to our existing legislation to prevent it from reocurring in the future.
Mr Savary's idea to employ the precautionary principle in land use planning is an excellent starting point, and we will definitely follow up that particular proposal.
I should also like to inform you of what happens when an accident like this occurs in one of the Member States.
As you know, we have a Civil Protection Unit that is immediately activated to offer the Member State in question the help and assistance of the network of different experts in all Member States.
France did not ask for any such assistance from our Civil Protection Unit.
We have tried to bolster our civil protection activities in order to have, for example, joint training and a much more effective network of experts of every kind.
For example, I was in Brittany after the Erika oil spill, when France needed help with bird cleaning.
Cooperation in such a specific area in Europe to establish such a unit that can be activated immediately is possible.
In an accident like this, France was offered all possible expertise from other Member States.
If we use a strengthened Civil Protection Unit in the best possible way, it can play the so-called 'green-helmet' role as a force that can be put in place immediately to help and act when accidents like this happen.
So we will definitely follow this up in a careful and coordinated way, in cooperation with the Member States, in order to see what more is needed as regards prevention.
As you have all said, our thoughts are with the victims, rescue workers, relatives and people in the Toulouse area.
We will continue to offer our help and assistance.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Environmental noise
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0296/2001) by Mr de Roo, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive relating to the Assessment and Management of Environmental Noise [6660/1/2001 - C5-0245/2001 - 2000/0194(COD)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our citizens are increasingly affected by noise.
Ten years ago, the European Commission estimated that the lives of a quarter of our citizens were disrupted by it.
These days, the European Environmental Agency notes that thirty percent of Europeans suffer from noise pollution.
That is an increase of twenty percent over a ten-year period.
In my own country, the Netherlands, the number of people burdened by noise is as high as forty-three percent.
More than ten million citizens in Europe have sleeping disorders.
All citizens in Europe are entitled to the same protection against unhealthy noise levels.
Unfortunately, our Environment Ministers do not share our opinion.
Unfortunately, the Council has not backed the proposal of the huge majority of the European Parliament at first reading to establish four daughter directives. These daughter directives pertain to motorways, air traffic, railways and factories.
That is why the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposes four daughter directives yet again.
What the European Parliament wants is an all-round approach.
The intention is to reduce aircraft noise at European level and to prescribe the same noise standards around busy airports in order to protect our citizens.
To bring down the noise of lorries and cars at European level and prescribe the same noise standards along busy roads.
To curb the noise of trains at European level and prescribe the same noise standard along busy railway lines.
To decrease noise in factories and ensure that only a small proportion of this noise penetrates into the outside world.
The Council has adopted the same opinion as the Dutch Environment Minister, Mr Jan Pronk, namely that noise is only a localised problem.
Our Environment Ministers expose our citizens to increasing levels of noise.
With regard to noise generated by road traffic, aircraft and trains, the Environment Ministers propose only a weak declaration but no binding legislation.
There are now only a few European noise standards in place which relate to, for example, household appliances, lawnmowers and high-speed links.
We desperately need European noise standards pertaining to aircraft.
Far greater steps are possible technically speaking, and Europe must render these compulsory.
European standards for lorries and cars are either non-existent or far too weak.
The tyre directive is a case in point.
Low-noise tyres may be available on the European market, but they are not yet a compulsory requirement.
By means of low-noise asphalt, an enormous noise reduction of ten to thirteen decibels can be achieved.
These technical advances must be incorporated in European policy.
In addition to European standards for high-speed trains, we also need standards for ordinary passenger trains and for goods trains.
The Council did agree to harmonising the measurement and calculation of noise.
There are currently fifty-one different methods used in Europe.
These are reduced to two by means of the same directive: Lden and Lnight.
Unfortunately, the Council dropped a few stitches in the process.
The Environmental Committee has offered to pick those up.
Similarly, most members of the Environment Committee have dropped a few minor stitches.
That is why the Group of the Greens, in tandem with the Socialist Group, is tabling four extra amendments.
Somewhat less high noise levels should also be measured.
The European Commission shares that opinion, and I invite the Commissioner to confirm this in public.
The common position states that the goal of the action campaigns is to mitigate noise.
In plain English, this means noise screens and double-glazing.
But that is not enough.
The action campaigns must also aim to reduce noise.
The majority of the Environmental Committee have adopted the Council' s position that a Member State must be able to establish its own noise indicator Lden.
That means that measurements no longer need to be harmonised but that the extra protection of the night can be reduced by a factor of ten, namely from eight to six hours.
That is pandering to the lobby and has nothing to do with the cultural discrepancies that exist between our peoples.
Precisely that eight-hour period of sleep is essential to everyone.
That is why we have tabled another common amendment in this instance.
I call on all my fellow MEPs to give this matter some more thought, and not to allow themselves to be used by the lobbies on Wednesday but to give priority to the health protection of our citizens.
Mr President, environmental noise is a very old problem that for a long time, has not in fact been taken seriously.
But it is a problem which is affecting many European citizens on a daily basis.
Furthermore, the economic damage it incurs is enormous, running into the tens of billions of euros annually.
I therefore welcome the proposed directive with open arms and certainly also embrace the rapporteur' s suggestions to turn it into a framework directive.
There has been much debate about the directive in this House, and unfortunately I have recently doubted on occasion whether all those taking part in the debate had actually read the proposal properly.
Indeed, and I will repeat it once again, this is not about laying down the same noise standards in Europe.
It is true that Europe boasts great cultural diversity, which means that what is experienced as disturbing in one country is not necessarily considered to be troublesome in another Member State.
I do not want to go into that diversity, for that is not what today' s debate is about.
So what is it about?
It is about measuring noise.
That should be done in a uniform way across the European Union.
For that purpose, a formula will need to be established on the basis of which maps can then be drafted.
The population will subsequently need to be informed of what would come under noise pollution.
On the basis of that information, which is measured everywhere in Europe in the same way on the basis of the same formulas, action campaigns can then be developed at local level.
I therefore repeat once again, and I would like to cite the European Commission in its explanatory statement, it is not the intention to establish limiting values which apply to the entire European Union.
What we will need to do, however, is to avoid situations we have at the moment, for example, in my own living environment.
For surely it is unacceptable that in one part of Europe, my region of Maastricht, an airport is not allowed to expand, while less than thirty kilometres down the road, in Belgium, based on more flexible requirements, a new airport is being opened without the slightest problem.
The population has everything to do with this.
In my opinion, 'shopping' distorts the market and should be prevented by the European airline companies.
Measuring methods are harmonised on the basis of a formula which takes into account - and that is something that needs to be explained to my fellow MEPs once again - the differences between 'day' and 'night' , the population density, but also the cultural diversity, which means that in Portugal or Spain, different 'day' and 'night' hours can be established.
The people in the south worry about the disturbance of the pace of life, but that is not a constant.
I should like to express a personal opinion on one other point.
All the other opinions I have expressed were on behalf of the group.
A great deal has been said about whether military airbases should or should not fall within the scope of the directive.
Although that aspect has meanwhile been removed from the directive, it has been revived by the rapporteur.
What I need to get off my chest - and I cannot explain it in any other way - is that I believe that military airbases should also be measured.
Especially in this day and age, everyone is of the opinion that military aviation should be given free rein.
I, too, am in favour of this, but that does not mean that they should not be subject to measurement.
That has nothing to do with offering slots.
Most proposals have been re-instated from the original Commission proposal.
That should in itself not be problematic.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group supports the line taken by the rapporteur, as indeed it did at first reading and also in the discussions and votes in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
The most contentious points, namely environmental noise around airports and also military airbases, are no longer on the table at this reading.
The Joint Statement lags behind the precise formulations of the Commission's proposal, but a long way behind Parliament's requirements for the European noise abatement policy.
For example, the Joint Statement has deleted all the fixed dates indicating the deadlines from which the noise maps have to be worked out and approved.
The same applies to the action plans.
My group therefore considers that all amendments which reintroduce these precise dates should be agreed and accepted as a matter of urgency.
Information is another point.
Amendment No 22 says that the Member States must ensure that the noise maps and action plans are posted on the Internet two months at the latest after being approved.
We think this is very important.
I believe that we can have general debates about how we bring Europe and its citizens closer together if we do not then shy away from very definite political proposals for putting information policy into action.
It is my view - one shared with both the speakers who preceded me - that the key question is whether any request by us for subsidiary directives will be successful.
I consider it to be progress in itself that there are harmonised methods of noise measurement and common noise indicators.
Such things can, though, be only the beginning.
What are we to say to people if we point out the problem but take no definite steps to solve it?
I believe that a time limit is needed here.
We cannot wait indefinitely for the next steps in this field to be taken.
It is for this reason that my group has joined with the Greens in signing the request for such subsidiary directives to be presented within three years.
Mr President, it may well be that 100 years ago our cities resounded to the noise of iron wheels and iron hooves bouncing off cobbled stones.
I suspect that made a hell of a din.
Nonetheless the impression is that our society has become noisier with more machinery, hi-fis and stereos, planes, trains and, above all, motorways.
I am all in favour of cutting noise and making life more pleasant, peaceful and calm.
I support the Commission's proposals for common measurements so that we all know what we are looking at and what we are hearing across the European Union.
I support the idea of noise mapping and I support legislation under single market rules to introduce limits on noise from new equipment being introduced and sold throughout the European Union.
But I am opposed to the Union seeking noise limits on installations in any individual Member State.
I do so, as I have argued strongly in committee, on the grounds of subsidiarity, in the belief that decisions should be taken at the lowest practical level.
In almost every case in the Committee on the Environment, we deal with issues which should rightly be dealt with at European Union level, because they concern matters which affect more than one Member State - transboundary issues.
But today I arrived in Parliament, I opened my window in the office in the Tower and I could not hear Strasbourg airport, I could not even hear the railway.
All I could hear was someone shouting down in the courtyard.
I do not regard noise from airports as a transboundary issue and I am pleased that the committee rejected a number of the amendments which were tabled.
I will be urging my group to reject Amendment No 34 here because it still implies that noise limits should be introduced.
Mr de Roo commented on Amendment No 36 that the eight-hour sleep limit is essential for everyone.
That may be the case.
It may also be the case that a cup of cocoa and a bedtime story are essential for everyone but this is not something which should be done at EU level.
We should not be setting standards for these things.
What is fascinating about this debate, as it was in committee and here now, is that for the best possible reasons - the improvement of health and enhancing the environment - measures have been suggested to us which represent a sort of creeping centralisation which, at the end of the day, makes the European Union seem bossy and interfering to far too many of our constituents.
We should take this opportunity, and indeed every opportunity, to put into practice our belief that wherever possible we should be applying strictly the principles of subsidiarity and making sure that when we take measures on behalf of the environment at European Union level it is because they will genuinely make a difference to individuals and cannot be done by individual Member States.
Mr President, European policy that tackles environmental problems is justified since air and water pollution are issues which extend across our national borders.
Fortunately, that is quite a different story for noise pollution.
I am pleased that I, in the Netherlands, am not affected by the noise produced in Milan or Athens.
In other words, noise pollution is a local, or regional, problem.
The internal market justifies environmental policy at European level, in order to promote fair competition.
This means, therefore, that European requirements can be prescribed for the safety and environmental friendliness of products and processes.
Clear examples of products are emission requirements for cars, lorries and machinery, while waste incineration and energy generation typify processes.
In relation to fair competition, European noise standards can also be prescribed for products, such as cars, motorcycles, lorries, machinery, trains and aircraft.
This is not appropriate for processes since the effects do not transcend borders.
In other words, I am in favour of European standards for low-noise tyres but am opposed to the requirement that the cobblestones be removed from the streets in Brussels on account of European policy.
The Council has already taken things very far in the environmental noise directive.
Parliament' s amendments, however, go even further, and I cannot back most of these as a result.
In addition, I cannot see the additional benefit a European noise pollution map would afford.
The Member States can map out noise pollution themselves if they so wish.
Moreover, if such a map were to exist already, I would still be opposed to a European policy on environmental noise.
A separate problem is aircraft noise.
Last week, I attended the ICAO Conference in Montreal on behalf of the European Parliament.
Unfortunately, it appeared that outside European, there is little support for stricter noise standards for aircraft.
Stricter noise standards for airfields are also a moot point.
Nevertheless, I remain of the opinion that airfield authorities must be able to pursue a powerful policy of their own by refusing large noise-makers.
Noise pollution caused by aircraft is mainly a problem for people who live near the airports.
In principle, this problem should therefore be solved locally, that is to say by the competent airport authority.
In various airports, this is already the case in that flight bans are issued for the noisiest aircraft or for certain night flights.
The disadvantage in this respect is that the problem could be transferred elsewhere.
In addition, airports in border regions can cause extra problems.
The latter must be solved mutually by the relevant Member States.
In this matter, I should also add that we must not inflate the issue.
If I want to fly to Strasbourg, I do not drive to Rome first because, due to competitive advantages, the flights there are cheaper than from Amsterdam.
As for the aircraft themselves, the problem is not that major technically speaking.
Thanks to modern technology, it is possible to produce aircraft which produce six times less noise than aircraft built thirty years ago.
Since the life of aircraft is about thirty years, the effects of these technical improvements, however, are taking a long time to kick in.
The question is whether this long wait is desirable.
I do not think so.
If we really want to do something about aircraft noise, technical improvements must be carried out more quickly.
The extra cost this entails obviously falls to the traveller who must be fully aware of the actual cost of flying.
Noise policy is a very new thing in an industrialised society that moves ahead simply by means of a great deal of technology and a lot of noise, and, as for the question as to whether noise policy is a subsidiarity issue, one is in two minds when answering it.
Mr Davies and Mr Blokland, if I were from your countries of origin, I too would adduce the argument from subsidiarity, but, my dear Mr Blokland, I know only two airports in the Netherlands whose flight paths, however, are located above my constituency.
All this is relative, and so I believe that we here must talk about whether we can find an air corridor to serve as a model for the compilation of fundamental criteria, and I believe that our views on noise maps are by no means so divergent.
I advocate comparable rules of measurement within the European Union as a matter of principle, and I also believe it to be self-evident that the action plans we arrive at on the basis of these measurements must be drawn up by the member countries, which must also implement and supervise them.
I take a great interest in the question, at what actual point such a regulatory mechanism takes effect, and here the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has without any doubt gone too far.
One could get the idea from reading the Committee on the Environment's text that, in future, every country lane will have to have its own noise map. The wording is doubtless much too vague, and what the Council proposes is quite simply boring.
If you are only to draw up such a noise map when the figure of six million cars per annum is reached, then I suggest you abandon the whole operation.
So, in my view, a good mean value would be a good solution.
As far as the measurement of noise from railway lines is concerned, it would have been good if we could have had another parameter for this, as noise from railways is perceived differently to that from motorways or airports.
Unfortunately, that idea foundered at the committee stage, something which I particularly regret.
I wish to contradict Mrs Ria Oomen, whom I otherwise greatly respect, by saying that I think it almost courageous to state the belief that politicians like us, who concern ourselves with the environment, can decide in an environmental directive whether military pilots fly or not.
Quite apart from the present situation, this Parliament does not have the right to regulate the times of practice flights by the French or the British.
I believe that military aviation should have no place in this directive and nor will it find its way into it. In other respects, I believe this debate to have been basically necessary.
I wish we could take this document to the Conciliation Committee; then, Mr de Roo, we would get away from your rather exaggerated demands and arrive at realistic ones that would get us somewhere in the overall scheme of things.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Florenz, I think these directives require us to consider in principle whether we want further exemptions for many governmental bodies, as the individual citizen does not, of course, care whether the aircraft causing the noise are civilian or military.
This is not, then, about ruling on what measures in terms of military tactics should be under discussion, but only about arranging flights in the context of a noise indicator and an action plan in such a way that overall noise does not exceed the level tolerable by individuals.
I believe that we should steer our joint efforts towards finding out what people find acceptable or intolerable and decide on that basis what steps to take.
There is a need for more research on this.
It has, for example, not yet been ascertained whether an average noise level is dangerous, or individual very high levels.
We therefore need even more understanding of causes, effects and connections.
Hence, too, our demand that we should not immediately announce a framework directive to which we attach specified noise indicators and limit values. Rather, we should say that we want to obtain the land registers first and then, in three years' time, to adopt appropriate subsidiary directives with quality standards for noise policy.
Secondly - and in my view this is at least as important - we should also be carefully re-examining individual noise emission sources in order to find out how, at European level - and perhaps more quickly and more effectively than by means of local action plans - we might achieve a reduction in the noise from aircraft and motor vehicles caused, for example, by their tyres.
So we also need noise reduction at the emission sources.
Mr President, noise pollution is, of course, a reality.
Furthermore it is increasing in most countries of the European Union. It is aggressive not only to the hearing but also to the whole nervous system of citizens and in many cases it alters not only the personality, through reactions such as irritability and insomnia, but it also produces pain in the auditory system.
I come from a southern country and to tell you the truth I have very often thought: 'Who could silence that lawnmower next door!
Who could make the traffic on this street quieter!
Who could stop the music coming from that discotheque on the other side of the block from reaching my windows!'
And on all those occasions when a citizen such as me has said, 'Why is there nothing or nobody that can stop this noise?' , it should be possible for most cases to be regulated, either by the local council, the residents association or the regional authorities. In other words, at a local level rather than a national level.
As numerous speakers have said, realistically speaking, it seems to me that there are practically no cases in which noise, at the level most citizens suffer it, should be dealt with in a cross-border fashion.
Airport noise has been mentioned, but it apparently affects 1.7% of the population of a country, while road traffic noise affects far more.
It seems to me that to concentrate on airport noise and not deal on a local level with road traffic, in particular, is a rather absurd form of discrimination against airports.
I am not going to go into that, however.
Above all, I wanted to make it clear once again that there is a difference between the various countries of the European Union in terms of noise and perceptions of it.
In this respect, Mediterranean countries are more noisy, we have a climate which allows us to be outdoors and, in this sense, eight o' clock in the evening is for us a time for socialising, to be out and to be professionally active.
We could never approve or support a directive which discriminates against other people' s cultures in this way.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Alexander de Roo on his tenacity in the fight against noise pollution.
Noise pollution is very disturbing and can form a threat to health.
Health is tied in with the environment and with the way in which we pollute the environment.
The Sixth Environmental Action Programme is right to devote much attention to this aspect.
This attention must lead to specific measures.
The guiding principle is to reduce noise to a level at which it does not threaten public health.
In this connection, the guidelines and opinions of the World Health Organisation should be taken into consideration.
Noise pollution is local and certainly does not transcend borders.
Solutions must be found by local, regional and national administrators.
We should be careful not to regulate too much at EU level.
Excessive ruling from Brussels is in most countries not appreciated - with good reason - but in few cases, European attention is certainly justified.
First of all, Europe must step in when the noise source exceeds limits, for example in the form of products.
There are already European rules in place for noise pollution, for example pertaining to the noise standards for lawnmowers.
Noise emission standards for certain products, such as cars, pleasure boats, lorries, trains, aircraft and industrial equipment are essential.
A second reason for European intervention is the making available of reliable and verifiable data.
The European Parliament pointed at the lack of data on various sources of noise a long time ago, and a common method must be found for measuring and assessing noise.
And this forms the very essence of the Commission' s proposal.
Thirdly, general principles must be formulated, such as: the polluter, or noise-maker, pays.
This kind of principle must be transposed in our legislation.
Citizens must - and that is, in fact, the most important point, in my opinion - have clear rights.
In the case of serious complaints about noise pollution, the right to investigation should exist and, if necessary, action should be taken.
Mr President, we all agree that noise pollution disturbs the everyday lives of the people of Europe.
I am however, rather surprised.
We are simply asking Europe to compensate for errors in land use planning that have been made in all of our Member States.
Why, then, should we appeal to Europe, since each Member State can decide for itself what it should do on its own territory?
We have already adopted measures on tyres and aircraft engines and we can do the same for road surfaces.
This is indeed a huge task, but why should we lay down regulations which, in reality, concern not only Member States but must also take account of differences between these countries and, above all, encourage local authorities to adopt the necessary measures in line with their local situation rather than us deciding for them?
This is the principle of subsidiarity and I am particularly keen to see it implemented in this area.
Locally elected representatives are responsible for deciding on what needs to be done in each town, county or region.
These are decisions for locally elected representatives.
I am one of them and I know very well what is involved in drawing up a strategic noise map.
We are told about airports, for example.
There are international airports, and there are national airports and there are considerable differences between airports.
The impact of noise is, therefore, different.
Why, then, should we impose standards that will not apply to all of them?
It should not be forgotten that airports are crucial to the areas in which they are located.
Infrastructures for air transport are a crucial factor for industries, which often choose where to base themselves on the basis of communications links and airports.
Is it worth emphasising that an exception absolutely must be made for military airports?
I agree with Mr Florenz.
The current situation clearly shows the importance of this provision.
I shall conclude by reminding you that the title of this directive is 'Assessment and Management of Noise' .
Management is, therefore, preceded by an assessment.
How can we attempt to set limits without a detailed and wide-ranging study, based on commonly established assessment criteria?
We would need to have precise maps on noise and then ask every Member State to implement effective action plans.
It is also crucial that we involve the public in these exercises, although this can only be done with the agreement of each country and each local authority.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is no exaggeration to say that a significant proportion of the inhabitants of Europe are forced to live with levels of noise which have a serious impact on their health, which is why I think it is important for the Union to launch an integrated strategy to combat noise.
We are currently at second reading and we need to focus on the main issues, as set out by the rapporteur.
If specifications are to be introduced for noise, a matter that concerns the Member States and industry, the Union needs to make specific proposals on broad guidelines, technical assistance for research and exchanges of information, on how to raise the awareness of the various parties and on how the proposed measures are to be applied and controlled.
As far as noise indicators are concerned, I agree with the Council's position allowing the Member States to move the night period by up to two hours because the southern countries have a different climate from the northern countries and I think this arrangement is essential.
As far as the proposed timetable is concerned, I think the Commission's initial proposal is feasible and that the Member States should set the administrative process in motion as quickly as possible so that the proposed directive can be put into practice.
Finally, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his sterling work.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, more and more Europeans are affected by environmental noise, but despite this, the European Union has been slow to implement a common policy in the field of noise.
I therefore agree with the ambitious options proposed by the rapporteur, Alexander de Roo, and I congratulate him on his work.
I supported his report in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and I support it again now.
I should like to highlight a few aspects in particular.
Firstly, I agree with the idea of transforming this directive into a binding framework directive to be followed by specific directives on noise caused by cars, motorcycles, trains and aircraft.
Secondly, I also agree with setting common noise limits in the areas surrounding all of the European Union' s civilian airports. Not only because the noise caused by night-time air traffic is more responsible than any other for depriving the general public of sleep, but also because, as a result of the lack of common regulations in the European Union, we have seen terrible distortions of competition between airports and a lack of fairness towards the citizens of the various Member States.
Thirdly, I welcome the amendments proposed for the joint position on noise indicators.
With these amendments, the Member States can move up to two hours of the evening schedule to the daytime or night-time period, which will enable legislation on noise to be implemented without this affecting the habits and traditions of each country, especially, those of southern Europe.
This new legislation must be implemented as rapidly as possible, but in order to ensure that it is complied with, Member States need to invest very quickly in the technical and human resources that are essential to monitoring and supervising its implementation.
Unless this is done, we will have yet another law that is good, but ignored.
Mr President, in my profession, I meet people with health problems caused by noise.
Health problems and unpleasant experiences of noise are, however, both very individual matters, which makes the issue of noise a difficult one.
For example, living next to a shooting range, with the type of noise produced there, may be a very unpleasant experience even if the range is rarely in use.
Some people find low-frequency noise and its vibrations very unpleasant.
I am convinced that we need more research into the problem of noise, and more knowledge about it.
One of the main reasons why the Europe we share is so fascinating is the many differences there are in our part of the world.
Variations in the European landscape and countryside are examples of this. The level of settlement varies according to whether we are talking about heavily populated areas in Central Europe, such as in the Netherlands, or sparsely populated areas in northern Europe such as are to be found in Sweden and Finland.
That is something we must consider when we take measures to combat the problems caused by noise.
Aircraft, cars and trains move between different countries and environments. It is therefore only right that they should comply with common provisions concerning noise.
However, industrial areas and airports are fixed installations, and their environments vary considerably.
That is why it is important that we should not become bogged down in future legislation on noise consisting of measures standardised from the perspective of Central European population centres.
Noise regulations must allow flexibility. Local and national authorities are better placed to take account of environmental factors in the case of permanent sources of noise.
We must comply with the principle of subsidiarity and draw up anti-noise regulations that it is possible to apply throughout the EU without there being unreasonable local consequences.
Mr President, I believe that sometimes the perception of the world changes so much that reality itself becomes serious, ridiculous and irrelevant.
I believe that this is happening in the case of noise.
In truth, noise and the activities which create noise - there is nothing more horrendous than a machine digging a hole in the street, and not allowing us to live - are mostly subsidiary. They come within the competence of local authorities, and it is therefore very difficult to get different towns to agree, for example, on closing times for bars, because they all want to compete.
However, despite this, I believe that this directive is guilty of wanting to homogenise all of us and I believe that is contrary to the idea of cultural diversity.
I often say that, in Mediterranean time, the day has 30 hours, while in the Northern countries it has 24.
But in our time the day has 30 hours because time is elastic: the grandmother goes to bed at 10 and the grandchild, on the same day, goes to bed at 5 in the morning and the following day everything works fine because time is miraculous, it is flexible, as flexible as society wants it to be.
It is therefore practically impossible to reduce all of this to mathematics.
I would even go as far as to say that it would reduce the European Union' s authority if the people thought that their own world was going to be subject to these directives.
Furthermore, I would remind you again that we are facing the serious problem of town and country planning.
There is no point in trying to pacify wild animals by playing music.
We must deal directly with the problem and that is town and country planning.
Also, I do not agree with some amendments, such as the one which deals with competition.
What does competition have to do with noise at airports?
Do we compete in terms of geography?
Do we compete if we are great distances apart, if we have different climates, if we have different conditions?
We could also say that we should all have the same number of hours of sun, but we do not.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, we must be prudent and culturally-aware, we must understand diversity and understand that people visit the South, amongst other things, because they have more fun and they can stay out very late at night on a terrace listening to music.
Mr President, this is the first directive that deals with ambient noise, as distinct from noise from a particular common source.
Indeed it is to be welcomed.
I also welcome the recent decision of the Committee on the Environment to restate that this draft directive should be strengthened into a framework directive out of which further, more detailed and specific legislation can follow, in other words, daughter directives.
A one-size-fits-all policy in relation to environmental noise and the different transport sectors, not to mention differing circumstances in Member States, is not satisfactory legislation.
I would like to mention another point.
I do not agree with the views of my colleague, Mr de Roo, in the specific amendments he has introduced on noise at airports and in the environs of airports in this piece of legislation.
That will be for another day as far as I am concerned.
I would like a response from the Commission in view of the opinion of the Advocate-General, delivered on 20 September last, on the preliminary ruling on the invalidity of Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EC) No 925/99 on restricting the use of aircraft at European airports in the interests of protection against noise.
This regulation was based, curiously and questionably, on design criteria rather than performance criteria.
I am referring to the controversial hushkits legislation, an example of how not to do something.
I would appreciate a Commission response.
Could the Commission indicate whether it will be proposing the repealing or amending of this regulation, because this is a most important issue.
We cannot pursue design criteria, as distinct from performance criteria, which favour one jet engine manufacturer over another.
That has got us into difficulties on this issue.
I would appreciate persistence in pursuing the issue of Mr de Roo's amendments.
In the light of what has happened with the hushkits legislation I would like a response from the Commission.
Mr President, I should like to make a couple of general points and a couple of specific points about this report.
Firstly, generally, I support the common position - it is a useful compromise - but I would not support going any further than that.
This is useful as a framework directive but I would not like to see lots of further directives springing from it.
We need to be very careful in applying the principles of subsidiarity, a view which is being widely expressed across the Chamber.
I am not sure that we would have any credibility whatsoever as a Parliament or as a European Union if we started to dictate to our citizens what hours they can or cannot sleep.
This is a matter that should be determined for them at a local level.
If an airport, for instance, is located in the centre of a city, then the limit values that should be acceptable there are completely different to those at an airport located out on a peninsula in a quiet rural area.
Why should not a particular community seek to set up an airport, for instance as a cargo hub, that can experience noise pollution in excess of what a large city should produce?
This is a matter for local authorities and for national governments and should not be a matter for this Parliament and for Europe.
I should like to ask those people who wanted to include military aircraft and military airfields within the scope of this directive, whether they are really saying, as Europe is, at the moment, in a state of war, that our airforces cannot operate at night or with planes that are too noisy, that they cannot defend our freedoms against terrorist attacks if their aircraft are too noisy.
I suggest that if that proposal is being made seriously, it would be laughed out of court across Europe.
I am in favour of legislation laying down noise limits for specific projects, but we really are going far too far in many aspects of the amendments proposed in this directive.
Mr President, first of all I should say that we are not trying by any means to suggest that people across Europe should go to bed at a certain time or laugh in certain places only, or to harmonise any of the different customs and cultural traditions in Europe.
The proposed directive on the table today, following on from our 1996 Green Paper, aims to develop a new noise policy to tackle noise which affects people, and not only noise from individual sources.
This will be done by drawing up harmonised noise maps to assess the noise exposure situation across the Community; informing the public about noise exposure and its effects; requiring authorities in Member States to develop action plans to achieve the required noise levels; and providing the European institutions with information on environmental noise, in order to assess the situation and develop further action.
There are 51 different ways to measure noise, but could we not agree on the means of measuring it within the Community?
That is the first step - actually drawing up these noise maps.
With regard to this last topic, I understand the concerns expressed by some Members who have tabled amendments making the case for proposals for daughter directives as of now to set new limit values for sources and environmental noise.
However, the success of the innovative noise policy we wish to develop relies notably on the quality of the data we will be able to gather.
At the moment, the lack of such information is obvious, notably due to the lack of harmonisation of the assessment of noise exposure within Europe.
The Commission believes that it would be premature at this stage to come up with proposals setting new limit values for noise.
We already have a raft of market access legislation which sets limit values for different kinds of road vehicles, for example.
It will be simpler and quicker to tighten the noise standards in existing legislation than to introduce new daughter directives.
We will consider what these standards need to be once we have the evidence from strategic noise maps and will, of course, report back to the Council and Parliament.
For these reasons, we cannot accept the amendments introducing daughter directives and limit values, but we are willing to propose further actions as soon as possible, which is why we wholeheartedly accept amendments strengthening the timetable.
The directive does not concern specific sources such as aircraft engines and hushkits.
The Commission has not yet had time to reflect on the ICAO decision last week, but we will of course come back as soon as we have had a chance to do so.
Moving on to the detail of the 36 amendments adopted by Parliament's Environment Committee, we are able to accept 28 of them, in full, in principle and/or in part.
We can accept Amendment No 1, which alters the title, to make the proposal a Community framework for the assessment and management of environmental noise.
However, as I said earlier, we believe that it would be premature to set new limit values, and thus we cannot support Amendments Nos 2, 3, 6 and 33.
As for the timetable for implementation of the proposed directive, we welcome Amendments Nos 10, 13, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23 and 25, which propose restoring the dates of the original Commission proposal, and in line with these amendments we can also accept in principle Amendments Nos 15 and 16, which seek to reinstate tighter deadlines, although we would have more reservations on the deletion of the two-phase approach for roads and railways.
In this respect, we cannot accept Amendment No 20.
Several amendments also help clarify the text, and, furthermore, we accept Amendments Nos 4, 7, 8, 14, 27, 28 and 29.
We can accept in principle Amendment No 5, which introduces four important principles, though we would not wish other principles to be excluded.
With regard to Amendment No 9, which seeks to reinstate the definition of human health, we support the first part of this amendment, while the reference to the World Health Organisation seems superfluous at this stage.
On the harmonisation of the common noise indicators, Lden and Lnight, Amendment No 11 makes the case for the compulsory use of these indicators for acoustical planning and noise zoning, while Amendment No 34 reintroduces the definition of an action plan being 'designed to reduce noise where a limit value in Lden or Lnight is exceeded'.
Within the Council an agreement was reached to use common indicators only for the purpose of strategic noise mapping, while the need for further harmonisation of indicators was postponed for consideration in the review proposed in Article 11.
Therefore, I am afraid we cannot support Amendments Nos 11 and 34.
However, since the directive now limits itself to strategic noise mapping, it is logical to support the principle of Amendment No 12.
Besides this, we also welcome Amendment No 36, which seeks to reduce the flexibility and the definition of the Lden noise indicator, thus making for more comparable results.
On public information, Amendment No 22 requires that the information to the public be published on the Internet within two months.
We welcome the principle of this amendment, but the dissemination of information to the public should not be limited to the Internet.
As for the review clause under Article 11 of the proposal, Amendment No 24 seeks to delete the reference to 'different climates and cultures'.
Owing to strong concerns expressed in the Council by Member States, we cannot support Amendment No 24.
In the annexes, we can support in part Amendment No 26, which seeks to make compulsory the provision of financial information on action plans.
Of the three types of financial information concerned, we would support the provision of budget information being made compulsory, while the others are more difficult to obtain.
Finally, we support Amendments Nos 30, 31, 32 and 35 to Annex VI, which partly restore the original provisions proposed by the Commission on the technical specification of strategic noise maps.
I thank the European Parliament and the rapporteur, Mr de Roo, for the detailed consideration given to this proposal and the helpful amendments which have been contributed.
They have undoubtedly strengthened the proposal and also improved its quality.
Mr President, I should merely like to clear up a misunderstanding.
An amendment to measure military noise has not been re-tabled, as was wrongly assumed by some MEPs.
That is therefore no longer a point of discussion.
We have taken note of this.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery
The next item is the report (A5-0287/2001) by Mr Lange, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery [COM(2000) 840 - C5-0742/2000 - 2000/0336(COD)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this very long title essentially covers machines with which we are all familiar, such as lawn mowers, chain saws, hedge trimmers, drills, all of which are mobile and to which environmental legislation has perhaps given too little attention in recent years.
We know, for example, that nowadays a four-stroke lawn mower emits exactly as much in an hour as a car in European category 4 travelling at 150 kilometres per hour.
Or we know that, on some days in June this year, 40% of carbon monoxide emissions originated from these mobile machines, 40% of the ozone precursors.
That is why we have to do something about this.
The proposed directive is all right in so far as it goes, but we made a number of critical observations in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
One point was that we wanted to move the timetable forward a bit, in much the same way as legislation in the United States takes place.
We wanted to see if the 'averaging and banking' model was perhaps after all unjustifiable in European terms, being something of a bureaucratic monster that would be hard to keep a check on in Europe and which, to that extent, would tell us little about whether we could achieve the reductions we were aiming for.
We tackled this issue very ambitiously in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
As the decision was made in July - in other words, quite some time ago - we were able to negotiate with the Council about this legislation.
I can now present a compromise package which the Council is prepared to accept by a large majority, if not unanimously.
It is my opinion that we should in this case go down this route and complete the legislation in its entirety in one reading.
On the one hand, that would help take the burden off the bureaucratic processes here in the European Parliament and in the Council, and on the other would also, of course, help the environment if the legislation could enter into force more quickly.
What is this compromise about?
Firstly, we want to move the date of entry into force forward for certain categories.
It is about midway between what was decided by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and what was proposed by the Commission.
Secondly, we want to dispense with the 'averaging and banking' system because of the bureaucratic difficulties involved in it.
In order, however, that environmental legislation should not produce distortions in competition which are not justified in terms of environmental policy, we want to make exceptions possible for small manufacturers producing 25 000 units per annum, and we also want certain products, the SH2 and SH3 machines, to be subject to transitional rules for a period of five years, for example certain chain saws used high up in trees or certain two-stroke motors that drive drills.
That is contained in Amendment No 30, so that these machines can be granted extra time - something which, incidentally, corresponds to what industry too has suggested.
I cannot therefore go down the road of excluding certain machines from the directive altogether, but I will say: let us give these machines more time if this is justified on technical grounds.
I would again remind you how, when we were very ambitious in legislating for cars in categories 3 and 4, we ended up in the Conciliation Committee reaching a reasonable compromise which, of course, met with little approval from the industry at first but which in the final analysis is now appreciated by everybody, because it improves air quality in Europe.
I think that the compromise package that I am able to present to you today points in the same direction, the only difference being that it is on the table already and not only after a conciliation procedure.
In this respect, what lies before us on the table today is not a 'chain saw massacre' , which one newspaper called it but, rather, a durable compromise to improve air quality in Europe.
Mr President, a rhetorical question often rhetorically asked is: which came first, the chicken or the egg?
In the case of new clean air technology, it is usually the case that government must first lay the legislative egg from which is hatched the technology to give us cleaner cars or lorries.
In the case of this report, however, the situation is reversed, because in the main the technology is available to clean up the small engines which, as Mr Lange says, can produce more pollution in one hour than a car travelling 150 km.
In many cases cost is the only reason for which we do not have cleaner engines already.
In fact, Honda can produce overhead valve four-stroke engines that easily meet these requirements.
However, there are some important exceptions to this general rule.
I am pleased that Mr Lange has withdrawn his suggestion that the small-producer exemption should be set at 10 000 units per year - which would not have covered any European manufacturers - and supported the Commission's position of 25 000, which covers 7 manufacturers.
However, we have some particular problems with this piece of legislation, and in particular with chainsaws and the like.
These are machines which have to be light because they are carried by people; they cannot be hot, to avoid burning the user; and they have to be multi-positional - in other words they have to work when upside down.
For those particular uses, two-stroke technology is the only viable option.
We remember seeing those Trabants and Wartburgs coming across East Berlin; these types of two-stroke engines are dirtier but, in the case of chainsaws, there is no alternative.
The solution put forward by the Commission is to use a system of averaging and banking, whereby dirty engines can be set off against clean engines and clean technology can be saved up for the next year and used to produce some dirty engines the following year.
I do not like this system.
In many ways it is dishonest, because people will be buying engines which they think meet the regulations, when in fact they are dirtier.
Only the big manufacturers who produce a wide range of engines can benefit from this.
This system should not be supported.
However, we need protection for these particular applications and that is why I have tabled my amendment - No 29 - giving a detailed list of exemptions: strimmers, chainsaws, brush cutters, machines for drilling holes in the ice and so on.
I am very disappointed that Mr Lange has not seen fit to support that amendment, because without the protection of this detailed list of exceptions, Mr Lange's amendment - No 30 - does not go far enough, relying only on some technical committee, some Commission assessment of the alternatives.
Mr Lange should think very carefully about my amendment, and then we would have a deal that both sides of this House could accept.
Mr President, this legislation has often been referred to as the lawnmowers directive.
The fact that MEPs are spending their time discussing lawnmowers will no doubt confirm the impression which too many of our constituents have about the value of our work.
If so, they should think again.
The blue smoke from generators, lawnmowers, pumps and so on tells its own story.
The cumulative effect contributes significantly to air pollution.
So, in contrast to the last debate where I argued strongly that we should emphasise the principle of subsidiarity, this is a matter which is clearly trans-boundary and for both environmental and single market reasons should be dealt with by this Parliament.
On the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy we all get used to industry representatives coming up to us and saying 'don't do that, the time-scale is too short, the technology is not available' .
So it has been a pleasure while this directive was passing through Parliament to be lobbied by one company - Honda, to which Mr Goodwill referred - which believes that the standards being proposed by the Commission do not go far enough.
I realise it has its own reasons for this position. It has made the investment.
It can meet the standards and it wants a competitive advantage over those who have not done the same.
But is that not what we want overall?
Is it not a good thing for manufacturers to be competing on the basis of setting the highest possible environmental standards?
I am sorry the committee has not accepted some of the amendments I tabled at an earlier stage.
I am sorry also that too many companies in my own country have failed to look to the future and want to continue producing dirty, polluting equipment instead of investing in the future and setting the highest standards so that they can compete properly across the world.
Here in Europe we should be aiming to set these higher standards subject to the available technology.
I agree with what Mr Goodwill said about chainsaws and the difficulty of reaching those standards insofar as that piece of equipment is concerned.
But I also want to resist, as Mr Lange said, the Commission's proposals for averaging and banking.
So far as I am concerned it allows manufacturers to continue to produce engines which do not meet the highest air quality standards and perhaps to even put new ones on the market.
After all, we are not saying that the changes have to be made now.
A transition period is built into the proposal to give time for re-equipment.
Amendment No 18 suggests that some financial support and incentives might be given to manufacturers.
I look forward to hearing the sound of my neighbour mowing her grass - and indeed my grass too, I hope - knowing that the air will be free from pollution and that the birds will not cough and splutter in the trees around my home.
Mr President, I wish to express my concern about the Environment Committee's amendment, listed as No 2, which seeks to remove what seemed to be the rather sensible averaging and banking option.
Now I note that the committee believes itself to be tackling pollution from leisure machinery which, it claims, accounts for a considerable proportion of the output of ozone precursors, especially on Saturday afternoons in the summer months.
Does the committee understand that a whole range of professional equipment is involved here?
We have heard about chainsaws, but there are many other examples.
Chainsaws are vital for managing woodlands.
Manufacturers say that if this amendment goes through, they will no longer be able to manufacture these goods.
The net effect of this, according to the practitioners, would be an adverse effect on the environment, and so I urge the House to reject the amendment.
However, knowing how enthusiastically this House embraces all or any legislation, no matter how insane or restrictive, perhaps I will not be sorry if the amendment is actually accepted because, given the amount of damage it will do, it will at least show Parliament and the European Union to be the mad legislative machine that it really is.
Ordinary people have suspected this for many years.
Perhaps in this case you will prove it to them.

Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Lange and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for an exhaustive and comprehensive report.
I also want to express my gratitude for the amendments tabled.
We have a basis for achieving a rapid and effective agreement.
Emissions of pollutants from normal motor vehicles have, of course, been subject to regulations within the European Union for more than three decades.
As a result, emission levels are now less than 10 per cent of those that existed before we introduced these limits.
Consequently, the relative importance of other emissions has increased and, at the same time, we can see, as we also can from the Commission' s Auto-Oil programme, that the problems of air quality in the Community require further measures.
The proposal we are discussing today concerns emissions from engines used in lawn mowers, power saws, leaf collection machines, pumps, generators and similar equipment.
Approximately 25 million machines of this type are manufactured in the world each year and, even if the statistics are rather unreliable, it seems as if such machines account for approximately 10-15 per cent of total emissions of hydrocarbon within the Community.
We have already heard this expressed in another way: that one hour' s use of a power saw releases as much hydrocarbon as does driving a modern private car more than 2 000 kilometres.
These emissions contribute to ozone formation, which is one of the air pollution problems we have still not solved.
Obviously, we must do something about the emissions from machines of this type.
Products of the type affected by the proposal are sold to the very largest part of the world market, and more than 90 per cent of them are manufactured by large companies active in this market.
It has been important to the Commission to bring about a harmonisation of the legislation so as to make it easier to introduce the legislation quickly, provided of course that this can be done in a way that is in keeping with a high level of ambition in environmental terms.
The only existing legislation in this area is that in the United States.
We consider that this legislation effectively satisfies the environmental requirements, and it has also been a big influence on the way in which our proposal is designed.
At the same time, I must alert you to the fact that there exist not only these big companies in the world market, but also companies which are not active in that market.
Even if these companies account for only a small part of total production, the products are often used in small specialised areas.
Many of the companies are small and therefore have limited resources for developing the technology needed to comply with the emission limits.
We have therefore proposed certain special rules exempting these products and companies, and these are the same types of exemption found in the American legislation.
In my view, the Commission' s proposal is an excellent example of a win-win situation since we are meeting the needs of industry at the same time as having brought about environmental benefits which would not have been possible if industry had needed to divide its resources to take account of different forms of legislation.
The Commission is able to accept those amendments which enable the Member States to mark products which meet the stage II requirements and to use economic instruments of control to stimulate production and sales of such products even before the limit values become compulsory.
The Commission is also able in principle to accept an earlier time for introducing stage II but is opposed to introducing stage I any earlier because it would put unreasonable pressure on small manufacturers who do not sell their products on the world market.
The Commission is also opposed to changing the definition of small manufacturers.
With regard to the so-called averaging and banking system, we are broadly sympathetic to the questions that have been raised concerning how this is to be used in practice.
However, we think that it is an important feature of the attempts to harmonise this area and that, if it were abolished, European legislation would differ from American legislation.
The reason for introducing such a system is that, where certain products are concerned, it is difficult to comply with the stage II values and that the particular products concerned vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.
In this context, it is important, if the necessary environmental impact is to be achieved, not to exempt products which in reality could meet the requirements.
Through averaging and banking, we have therefore introduced a flexible system which places the administrative burden on those manufacturers who wish to use it and which has a sound impact upon the environment.
If, on the other hand, use is made of the facility to exempt certain products, there is a risk of drastically reducing the impact upon the environment because these exemptions are not offset, as is the case with the averaging and banking system.
We must also be clear that the exempted products we are talking about are equipped exclusively with two-stroke engines, which are the most polluting.
The Commission therefore wishes to emphasise the importance of retaining this instrument as a part of the legislation and opposes the amendments in question.
At the same time, I wish to emphasise that what is essential is not the averaging and banking system as such but bringing about the flexibility, harmonisation and environmental benefits provided by the system.
Exemptions of certain types of equipment should therefore be accepted only after a careful analysis of the consequences, environmental and otherwise.
For that reason, the Commission is opposed to introducing exemptions right now but is able to accept that this will become a possibility through making use of a committee procedure in the future.
We also oppose amendments that exclude the use of two-stroke engines for generators and snow-blowers.
The Commission is prepared to look into the need for further legislation in this area, especially when it comes to particle emissions from two-stroke engines, and wishes to coordinate it with corresponding demands concerning particle emissions from motorcycles and mopeds.
The Commission is able to accept, or in principle to accept, Amendments 1, 10, 11, 13, 14, 18 and 28 inclusive, together with Amendment 30.
The Commission is not able to accept Amendments 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 15 and 17, but is open to studying solutions that can bring about flexibility, harmonisation and environmental benefits.
The Commission is not able to accept Amendments 4, 5, 9, 16 and 29.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
Expiry of ECSC Treaty
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the framework proposal before us establishes the succession of the European Community to the ECSC.
According to the proposal, the net revenue deriving from the investments of the assets of the Coal and Steel Research Fund would constitute revenue in the EU budget.
This revenue would be earmarked for a specific purpose, namely for financing research projects in the sectors related to the coal and steel industry.
The Research Fund would be managed by the Commission.
Out of the amounts yielded by the Fund, 27.2% would be allocated to the coal sector and 72.8% to the steel sector.
This breakdown could be modified only by a unanimous decision by the Council.
Lastly, the proposal states that the administrative expenditure resulting from the liquidation, investment and management of the Research Fund will be covered by the general budget.
Ladies and gentlemen, in this brief summary I have not forgotten our role: quite simply, in its future form, what was the first European Treaty, the first stone set in place for the creation of a united Europe, completely abolishes our institution.
I am firmly opposed to the approach of the Commission, whose framework proposal provides for Parliament merely to be consulted on matters concerning the fund' s financial and technical guidelines.
Such a passive role is envisaged for us that it is completely contradictory to the present-day requirements of transparency and accountability, and Parliament would have even less power than it does in budgetary matters.
In my report, I made a number of demands to the Council: firstly, I asked for the codecision procedure to be applied; secondly, I requested the full budgetisation of the annual interests of the fund as preallocated revenue, through the creation of a specific budget line in the revenue and expenditure side of the budget following the principles of budgetary specificity and neutrality, in line with the provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement and the Financial Regulation; thirdly, I requested that the related administrative costs, estimated at around EUR 8.4 million, should be included in this budget line, for otherwise they would have to be met from the general budget.
In addition, I included the possibility of revising the ratio of appropriations dedicated for coal and steel research respectively, as production will increase as a result of enlargement.
I have noticed that the resolution tabled before the House still contains a reference to the ECB, which I would ask you to disregard: this is an amendment which I have withdrawn and which has remained in the resolution due to a technical error.
With regard to the request for the codecision procedure to be applied, I would stress that the Commission' s legislative proposal is based on the Treaties and on the Nice Protocol, which states that the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission after consulting the European Parliament, is to adopt all the necessary provisions for the implementation of this Protocol.
In practice, Parliament is deprived of any power, despite the fact that the administrative expenditure of the Coal and Steel Fund would have to be met from the general budget.
This means that Parliament would have to approve this additional expenditure and give discharge to the Fund without having any influence at all over the implementation of its activities.
My request for the codecision procedure to be applied is not, therefore, a request for a different legal basis to be used, just for reference to be made to a different article.
Indeed, the Commission' s document refers to the Treaty establishing the European Community, without specifying any particular article, and to the Protocol annexed to the Treaty of Nice, Article 2 - under which the European Parliament has consultation powers only - a Treaty which, however, is not yet in force and which it is highly unlikely will become effective before July 2002.
Consequently, we are in a very fluid situation which has never occurred in the past and will never occur again, since the ECSC Treaty is the only Treaty to have an expiry date, and I would stress this.
Moreover, even if the Protocol annexed to the Treaty of Nice does come into force, it only refers to the procedure for approving the package as a whole and makes no mention of the multiannual decisions.
I therefore propose to request that the codecision procedure be applied, as laid down in Article 2.5.1 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in this I believe and hope I can count on the same support from this House that I received in the Committee on Budgets.
Then, with regard to the full budgetisation of interests and the possibility of the administrative costs being met from this budget line, Parliament gave its consent in 1998 for all the interests of the Fund to be used for research.
Ladies and gentlemen, as I said before, the situation which we have to address is highly unusual and will certainly never be repeated: we are dealing with the only Treaty to have an expiry date, the succession of the European Community to which depends largely on a Treaty which has not yet been ratified and may well not be ratified in time.
In my opinion, and in this I am supported by the coordinators of the political groups in the Committee on Budgets, if the line I have taken in the legislative amendments is endorsed by this House, before expressing the European Parliament' s opinion, we should enter into negotiations with the Council and the Commission, seeking to increase our institution' s role.
Therefore, when we have voted on the legislative amendments, I will ask the presidency to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution until the possibility of an agreement with the Commission and the Council increasing Parliament' s role can be verified.
I hope that you will agree with this line of approach.
Mr President, Mr Turchi deserves our agreement.
What the Council is offering us is a bit rich.
In Nice, fundamental democratic values were invoked, and in the same breath the ECSC Treaty is annulled and a research fund established, without the possibility of Parliament having any part in deciding the matter.
I must say, they really have a nerve!
Back to the matter in hand.
We are, in fact, funeral orators here, for we are burying a treaty which, almost fifty years ago, was the prelude to the European Union, but whose death is a remarkable one.
It is a death and a rebirth together, for other treaties arose from this one, and at the end of the day, the European Union is based on what it had in mind.
In this context, I would like to point out that Robert Schuman at the Paris Conference in 1950 - held on 9 May, which is of course our Europe Day - observed that this was the first stage of European federation.
He did not speak in terms of a coalition of nation states but of a European Federation, showing himself to be much more far-sighted than many of our statesmen and stateswomen and, indeed, than those among us who cannot yet bring themselves to utter the word 'federation'.
I am just pointing this out; I assume that it will be mentioned in the history books.
Secondly, this treaty is now to give birth to a research fund.
Mr Turchi has pointed out that the money is not simply being returned to the Member States, but is being invested in a fund which is in future to finance research into coal and steel.
This is sensible, but it does create problems.
One is that Parliament has no control over this fund.
I mentioned this contradiction at the outset.
A second is that it creates difficulties for the research framework programme.
What demarcation is there between the research framework programme, which we decide on democratically, and the Research Fund?
Thirdly, what is to happen to the acceding countries?
Every one of them wanting to belong to the Research Fund must in fact make an initial contribution to it in order to take any part in it.
Even that creates more than one class of research in the European Union.
What I suggest - something which has been taken on board by the Research Committee - is that we should resolve this conflict, and, moreover, in a positive way by, in the course of the next few years, creating from this Research Fund a Research Foundation which would develop alongside the research framework programme. Funds could be paid into it by Member States, but also from private sources - it is above all the private sources I am thinking of - in order to finance research projects other than into coal and steel.
In the meantime, we are fortunate in having many affluent people who do not know what to do with their money when they reach a certain age, and who make donations.
Trust funds come into being, and this Foundation can be built up by donations of this sort and so be able to concern itself with subject areas far more wide-ranging than coal and steel.
I hope that Parliament will agree to this recommendation.
The consequence would be that the Commission would reconsider and would perhaps present a report on how this could be translated into action.
We have some experience of this in Germany.
Parallel with State support for research, we have a research foundation which has functioned well ever since the 1920s and uses a minimum of bureaucracy in putting wind in the sails of German research.
It would be no bad idea to do that on a European scale.
Let me finally observe that proposals 1 to 5 in my report are founded on an error.
I recommend that we should not vote on them.
They are in any case covered by their inclusion in the Turchi report and in the amendments.
I therefore recommend that there should be no vote on them.
I might add that they were not voted on in committee either.
This really is a mistake.
Apart from that, I hope that this research fund really will give rise, in the next five to ten years, to a second support for research in the European Union.
We would thereby be making good this undemocratic error which is, in this day and age, really intolerable.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the PPE-DE Group is going to vote in favour of the Turchi report on the two amended proposals for Council decisions and the communication from the Commission on the financial activities resulting from the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and those resulting from the creation of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel.
We also agree, like all the other coordinators of the political groups - we have already done so in the Committee on Budgets - with the strategy proposed by the rapporteur.
From a budgetary point of view, the report proposes certain innovations which, after discussion in our parliamentary committee, have been accepted by all the political groups in that committee.
In particular, the rapporteur accepted the suggestion to extend the list of advisory bodies by adding the European Central Bank, the European Investment Bank and other European institutions that are relevant and competent in this field.
Furthermore, the original conditions on the financial programme which should be presented to explain the activities of the Research Fund were also relaxed.
The original idea of producing annual financial plans seemed excessively restrictive.
Basically, however, the Turchi report requests parliamentary control of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel and that request is totally coherent with this Parliament' s role.
We would not be representative of European citizens if we accepted being left out of the control of research funds.
We in the Committee on Budgets do not question where the ECSC reserves should end up, and neither do we enter into whether or not those companies maintain differential treatment in relation to other strategic sectors.
We simply ask that co-decision be applied here, which the Council is repeatedly denying us.
If, as Mr Linkohr said, a European policy on coal and steel is going to continue to exist after the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and if that policy is going to be developed largely by means of this Research Fund, the European Parliament must naturally be involved in the processes of management and control of that fund.
We therefore ask that the income of the fund be included within the general budget of the Union.
More budgetary control, more parliamentary control, means more transparency and more responsibility.
We cannot understand why our institution should be left out of such an important area.
We are therefore voting in favour of the Turchi report and the whole strategy it proposes.
Mr President, I support the proposals in the Linkohr report.
The situation in which we are seeing the Commission and Council fail to give Parliament codecision in relation to this Fund and the technical guidelines which will be produced in relation to it is not acceptable and there should be a change of attitude in relation to that.
It is a great pity that we are moving away from the social policy aspects of these Funds, which provided some relief for companies and, in particular, the workers of companies who were being restructured.
ISPAT in Cork, Ireland, which was formerly a state company, was bought over some years ago by a private company and is now in liquidation.
The 400 workers there are in receipt of statutory redundancy - a few thousand pounds for literally a lifetime's work - and yet when government and trade unions sought support from the social policy aspects of this Fund they were refused.
It is quite extraordinary that we have this situation.
It is even more extraordinary because ISPAT was a plant which recycled scrapped steel: the objective of the new Research Fund is to improve environmental standards and the impact of the steel industry on the environment, and here was a company that was actually doing that.
It must be emphasised very strongly that, insofar as this Research Fund has any impact, it must be on safety at work.
In January this year there was an unfortunate case where a man lost his life in this steel factory.
The company had failed to invest in fire-fighter training and to provide for escape hatches and this man lost his life as a result of the company's negligence.
We need to ensure that health and safety regulations are strictly enforced.
Mr President, I would like to welcome and endorse my colleague, Mr Linkohr's report, particularly his comments on the involvement of Parliament and on the evolution of European Union democratic structures.
This Treaty, along with the Euratom Treaty, remained outside the treaties establishing the European Union and therefore outside democratic scrutiny and control.
This is totally unacceptable, particularly at a time when energy installations, both nuclear and non-nuclear, could be a focus of terror attacks.
Therefore health and safety should be our foremost concern.
As other colleagues have pointed out, the lack of parliamentary scrutiny has made the Commission's proposals unacceptable and the Greens cannot, therefore, agree to the Commission's proposal on the expenditure for the research fund.
For how could Parliament's Committee on Budgets discharge the budget without exercising its function to scrutinise the financial management and allocation of funds?
Finally, the expiry of the ECSC Treaty after 50 years reminds us that the Euratom Treaty, which has also existed outside the democratic scrutiny and control of this Parliament, is an anomaly as more and more Member States are moving away from nuclear energy and towards new forms of energy and that this anomaly, which happily will end with the Coal and Steel Community, still continues with the Euratom Treaty.
Mr. President, over the previous decade the European Coal and Steel Community has borrowed money from the markets and in turn has loaned funds for research activity in the coal and steel sector.
With the Coal and Steel Community now ceasing its operations, it was found during the winding-up proceedings that it still has a surplus of 1.1 billion euros.
Now, rules of the game are being created to govern how the yield on this money will be used for research activity in the coal and steel sector.
I regard the setting up of the Research Fund as a positive thing, while on the other hand the ending of funds for use in combating social ills is a bad thing.
According to the Commission proposal, the management of funds investment activities is being handled and research projects are being prepared by an army of about thirty officials, the maintenance of which will cost three and a half million euros; this gives the impression of an oversized bureaucracy, and therefore Parliament must take another look at the matter when it discusses the questions of releases of liability.
According to the revisions contained in Mr. Linkohr's report, a special European Research Foundation should be set up; the activity of the Coal and Steel Research Fund should be extended to other areas; and funding from the private sector should also be accepted.
Mr. Linkohr, this is a dubious proposal.
We already have the EU's Joint Research Centre and a framework programme for science and research.
I understand Mr. Linkohr's positive approach to research activity, but we must not create a new bureaucracy.
It is necessary to set up a Coal and Steel Research Fund, since the ECSC is winding up its operations.
It is justified that its funds be ploughed back to the sectors from which they were accrued, but the idea of a Research Foundation which would be funded by the money of the EU's taxpayers and of firms will increase the amount of inefficient bureaucracy.
It would be better for Parliament to demand the codecision procedure for the science and research sector, and to leave all aspects of implementation of the programmes to the Commission.
We do not question Mr. Linkohr's good will towards science and research.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a treaty expires, but the foundations remain, for the foundation, the ECSC Treaty, has long been part of the structure of the European Union.
We still, too, have the day of commemoration of 9 May 1950, that day when Robert Schumann presented the brilliant plan of Jean Monnet from the South of France and thereby laid the foundations of what we today call the European work for peace.
The ECSC Treaty has two successors: the subject of our speeches today and, as regards future coal mining, the aid issues with which we will deal later on.
I would like to make four brief remarks about the two reports before us.
First, the procedure proposed here is distinguished by pre-democratic conceptions.
This was tolerable in 1952, but it is of course no longer acceptable to let the Council alone decide when, in the meantime, the Union's citizens have elected us to be their fifth democratic Parliament.
We must be clear about that.
Second, it is right to use the annual revenue of EUR 45 million to support coal and steel research.
One could say in legal terms that it is an anticipated form of reinforced co-operation among a few.
It is of course just as right to consider how the committee recommends, on the basis of Mr Linkohr's presentation, to progressively make the fund into a foundation, because then the problem of new members will be easier to solve than if they had to have a share in the old members' contributions.
Third, the Commission has done the right thing in subordinating the Research Fund to fundamental rights, for the Charter of Fundamental Rights recapitulates the laws in force.
That means that everything that is to be organised at a European level must be measured against the yardstick of fundamental rights and is bound by them.
I find it objectionable that the Council, in its deliberations, struck out these three proposals by the Commission and wants to remove the text's reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
That constitutes an incredible legal scandal, which we must denounce, and for that reason I call it by its name.
So I come to my fourth point, and am particularly curious to know how you, Commissioner, will respond to it. Your Commission originally rested on a different legal foundation.
You now refer to the protocol to the Treaty of Nice, and that is pretty breathtaking, as the Treaty of Nice is not expected to enter into force before 23 July 2002.
On that day, however, the ECSC Treaty ceases to have effect, and we can hardly allow a lawless state of affairs.
So I would very much like a reply from you as to how you intend to proceed and as to what you intend to propose, so that there will be no state of lawlessness from midnight on 23 July 2002, for then the gripping question would arise of to whom this money, which would then no longer have an owner in law, actually belonged.
Mr President, I agree with the many speakers who have criticised the lack of democracy in the continued administration of the funds.
As has been pointed out, the treaty expires on 23 July of next year.
This treaty formed the basis for the European Union as we know it today.
It launched the concept of the 'Common Market' and, with the introduction of the High Authority, a common assembly, a special Council of Ministers and a court, those institutions were established which now operate as the Commission, the European Parliament the Council and the Court of Justice.
I think it is worth mentioning this.
Where the political objectives are concerned, it has of course to be said that these have been fulfilled in many areas.
When we debated the future employment of the funds to be administered, it would have been desirable if a larger proportion of the budget could have gone on coal, and I am certain that the Commission will bear this in mind when the future arrangements for the Research Fund are discussed.
I think there is cause here today for expressing appreciation for the work done in those institutions, bodies and companies which, for 50 years, have been responsible for the ECSC' s activities and, specifically, for the contributions from the Commission and the advisory committee.
As has been said, more research will take place, and this research will be of benefit to the environment, industry and our electorate in the European Union.
First of all I thank Parliament's responsible committees and their rapporteurs.
These proposals are the final product of a long discussion process initiated by the Commission ten years ago.
The concept proposed by the Commission is to revert the ECSC assets to the remaining Communities upon expiry of the Treaty and to use the resources produced from these assets for the sole purpose of funding research in the sectors related to the steel and coal industry.
This concept has been discussed with industry, the social partners, the European Parliament and the Member States.
Eventually all stakeholders endorsed it.
The Member States have been very closely associated in this discussion, which is completely justified since together they are the owners of the ECSC assets.
If there were no agreement on the Member States' side these assets would simply revert to them, in line with the principles of international law.
The European Council has provided us with detailed guidance on the subject, firstly at the Amsterdam European Summit in 1997 and more recently at the Nice intergovernmental conference last year.
On this latter occasion the Member States adopted a protocol attached to the Nice Treaty which details the arrangements regarding the expiry of this Treaty.
The Commission is bound to respect the decisions taken in Nice.
It is in this context that the Commission has to address your amendments.
You have requested that all three decisions should be adopted through the codecision procedure.
I regret to say that the Commission cannot accept this request.
In the case of the framework decision, the decisional procedure has already been agreed upon by the intergovernmental conference in Nice.
For the two decisions on the financial and research guidelines respectively, the Commission has followed the same line as for other, similar proposals in research policy or regarding our financial regulation.
For example, the specific programmes of the European Union Research and Development Framework Programme are submitted to Parliament for its opinion, as is the case for the Financial Regulation.
If the Commission departed from this line it would not be consistent.
On the other hand, I would like to stress that Parliament's involvement in the proposed arrangements is much stronger than it was under the ECSC Treaty.
As regards the budgetisation of the funds after the expiry of the Treaty, the Commission agrees that the resources and the expenditure will be incorporated into the general EC budget.
However, they will consist of earmarked revenue which, according to our Interinstitutional Agreement, is not covered by the financial perspectives.
Therefore we could not go along with the proposal to simply incorporate the resources and the expenditure into Chapter III, internal policies of the budget, and to delete any reference to earmarked revenue.
You also suggested that within two years, by 24 July 2004, the Commission should make proposals to enlarge the post-ECSC research fund into a European research foundation covering all research sectors over and above steel and coal.
Indeed, I am aware that such a foundation has been suggested to us on several occasions.
I have noticed that the corresponding amendment refers to the draft decision on the research guidelines only.
From a legal point of view the research guidelines lay down the technical provisions related to the implementation of the research activities, but they cannot cope with an issue of an institutional nature like this one.
More generally speaking, the proposal to set up a research foundation has already been made to the Commission on several occasions, in particular in the course of the discussion in the Council, but it was rejected.
The first reason is that the management of the ECSC funds after 23 July 2002 will involve three aspects: firstly, the management of the ECSC commitments existing on that day until their expiry - and in some cases they will continue for 20 years or more; secondly, the financial management of the ECSC assets; and thirdly, the management of the research fund financed from the resources produced from this financial management.
The three elements are therefore closely interlinked and it is not possible to isolate any one of them.
Furthermore it is clear that a majority of Member States oppose the implementation of the research fund through a foundation.
Finally, the very small amount involved in the proposed research fund would not justify the creation of a foundation.
Therefore the most sensible solution is that the Commission, which has managed all ECSC operations so far, should continue to manage them all.
Finally, I have taken note with particular interest of your request that environmental considerations should be given priority in the operations of this coal and steel research fund.
I am pleased to say that current research projects financed under the ECSC Treaty already put much emphasis on cleaner technologies, energy saving and the protection of the environment in both the coal and steel sectors.
I can assure you that we will continue to attach great importance to these considerations, as well as the issue of safety at work, in the research guidelines which we are now proposing.
To conclude, let me answer Mr Mombaur's question on the specific issue concerning the legal basis of the three-year Commission proposals.
As you know, they are based on a protocol annexed to the Nice Treaty and we will now have to reflect on how to deal with the uncertainty surrounding the entry into force of the Treaty.
The Commission's services are currently exploring this issue and considering alternative scenarios.
So the answer is that we will have to continue to look at that particular issue.
Thank you once again for the careful analysis of the Commission proposals, your contributions to this debate and for your attention.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
(The sitting was closed at 8.55 p.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
I will give the floor straight away to Mrs Roure so that she can give us the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
Roure (PSE), rapporteur.
(FR) Madam President, on 14 November in this very Chamber I tabled a report - which Parliament approved - on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on a French initiative with a view to adopting a Convention on improving mutual assistance in criminal matters.
Today the Council is consulting us once again, this time on a new text of a draft protocol.
Following the Extraordinary European Council meeting of 21 September, which was devoted to the fight against terrorism, we are called on to make a decision on this as a matter of urgency.
Obviously I understand that current circumstances are impelling the European Union to strengthen cooperation as quickly as possible in the fight against terrorism.
Nevertheless, I should like to make a number of comments.
I will start by expressing my regret that the Council did not accept the amendment which we proposed and which sought to extend the non-invocability of professional secrecy to commercial activities and the financial advice activities of lawyers and other members of regulated legal professions.
I do actually still believe that this provision is essential to the effectiveness of judicial cooperation to combat money laundering.
I also regret the fact that the Council did not reach an agreement on dual criminal liability.
Having said this, I see that the text of the protocol contains much more precise provisions on monitoring banking transactions.
I also note with interest that in the future it will be Eurojust which will play a major role in ensuring that the mutual assistance system works smoothly.
Having made these comments, I can of course go along with the Commission and accept that the European Parliament should, in this exceptional case - without a report and in accordance with the urgent procedure - today approve the text which is before it.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
The item will be added to Thursday' s voting time.
White paper on reform of European governance
The next item is the statement by the Commission on the White Paper on Reform of European Governance.
Without further ado I will give the floor to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.
Madam President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, in the 51 years of its existence, since the beginning of the European unification process and since the Robert Schuman Declaration, the European Union can lay claim to a considerable success story.
In addition to establishing the common market, the single currency and the beginnings of a common foreign and security policy, we have also become an area of peace, justice and security, and in this we are a model for many regions of the world.
But why is it that our citizens do not see the actions of the various institutions of the European Union in a proper light, as we might expect?
Why is it that they so often fail to evoke a positive response?
The question that immediately comes to mind is of course why the European Union has such a poor external image and why it is so bad at initiating and implementing its policies.
These questions of course provide the basis for the Commission's White Paper of 25 July of this year, and we are delighted that the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is here to discuss this issue with us for the second time today and has just offered us cooperation within an interinstitutional working party.
I think this is an excellent suggestion that we should accept promptly and in a constructive spirit.
Another question is why our public image in the EU Member States is so patchy - I do not wish to say dismal - yet it cannot really be said that the European Union stumbles from one failure to the next.
I think that a key point here is what the Commission says at the beginning of the White Paper: it should go back to concentrating on its core activities.
The Commission should not allow itself to get tangled up in a mass of individual proposals and decisions so that in terms of overall policy strategy you cannot see the wood for the trees.
As I see it, there are a few more questions that we need to consider in some depth before we will find the appropriate answers.
We certainly recognise that the Commission - and I think that all the institutions need to do this - has subjected and is continuing to subject its actions to a critical review process, after which it can then adopt any changes necessary after discussion with us.
We also support the Commission's intention to focus on particular areas, but we have to say that the Commission should in that case undertake appropriate work with the press.
It should make it very clear to the public what European legislation consists of and how it has to be implemented.
There is also a second important issue here.
There is no point in the Commission setting up its own substructures in various fields, and I believe that it has in fact largely ceased to do this.
It should make use of existing public agencies at national, regional and local level to implement Community legislation.
There is no need for the Commission to arrange direct involvement in every local district and in every medium-sized town. Although it is important to keep citizens informed, suitable forms of interaction should be used.
Framework legislation produced by the Commission should provide for implementation at regional and national level, and it seems to me that the Commission's first proposal in the 25 July White Paper blurs the distinction between the various levels too much.
So what is needed? Joint regulation?
Open coordination?
To what extent are European agencies needed?
We need to address all these questions in our interinstitutional working party.
Madam President, Mr Prodi, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am very grateful for today's report.
We are moving ever closer and our views have more and more in common, but there is still a way to go, and there is one particular point on which I believe that we still differ.
Firstly, you have today clearly declared your faith in a form of parliamentary democracy that of course has important consequences for our work as a whole, and in particular for the role of 'civil society' .
That is another of those rather nebulous concepts rather like 'governance' , but 'governance' is used in contexts where there are no parliamentary democracies or cannot be, as in the case of 'global governance' .
In the case of civil society, and I think you were very clear about this, we need to stress that although it has a consultative role and a supporting function, it is the European Parliament and of course also national parliaments that are at the heart of democracy as we know it.
As you said yourself, they are an expression of the will of the people, and we must insist on that point.
The key point on which there are still differences between us is the issue of alternative forms of regulation.
We are not so presumptuous as to think that only Parliament can regulate and that only Parliament can create appropriate regulations, including detailed regulations.
However, the difficult thing is to decide on the framework, details, a political objective and technical implementation.
So I must insist that this Parliament is always consulted on this issue and that it is not the Commission that decides, but that there should be a joint decision, a kind of Interinstitutional Agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission.
This applies in particular to the issue of call back that we have also been discussing today.
Let me make this crystal clear: we need both things. We need a Parliament call-back procedure in connection with alternative forms of regulation, and we need to reform comitology.
We have nothing against the reform of comitology proposed in the White Paper, but it is not enough.
It is necessary if the decision-making process at parliamentary level is to become more democratic, but it is by no means enough.
Mr President, I hope I have understood you correctly in understanding that you will not present anything to the Laeken European Council unless it has been discussed with this Parliament beforehand and the views of this House have been sought.
You said this in general terms, and I welcome that, and I can see from your nodding that that is indeed your intention.
That represents a great step forward compared with the last time, and I would like to thank you very much indeed for that.
By way of conclusion, I would like to make one more thing clear. This is not about Parliament getting involved in the Commission's executive powers.
However, we very much reject any attempts on the part of the Commission - and they have been made - to get involved in the legislative process and to arrogate legislative powers to itself.
This emerges from many sentences and passages in the White Paper, and we must reject this.
The Commission has executive powers, but legislative competence is a matter for the Parliament and the Council and we absolutely insist on that!

Madam President, support for the European Union is decreasing in just about every Member State. In the candidate countries, enthusiasm for enlargement is in decline.
There is little confidence in the European institutions, and the individual citizen can feel that the gap between 'those in Brussels' and 'those of us at home' is extremely large.
We are all painfully aware of this, and I am very pleased to find such a large measure of self-criticism in the Commission' s White Paper.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the White Paper on Reform of European Governance.
These changes are an important part of the major work of reform we are facing over the next few years to make the EU more easily accessible, efficient and democratic.
We are very well disposed towards the start made by the White Paper. It points out the problems and shows where changes are required.
Some of the overarching proposals are entirely in line with what the Liberals have been pressing for over a period of quite a few years.
There must be an increase in openness and public control.
The new rules adopted earlier this year in accordance with Article 255 are a first step on the way.
The decision-making processes must be simplified and made clearer.
There must be regional, as well as local, involvement at an earlier stage of the decision-making process, and we must discover mechanisms for regular consultation at these levels for it is, after all, regional and local authorities that will be implementing the majority of the EU' s decisions.
It is also very encouraging that the Commission wishes to work more with framework legislation and strengthen the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
There is little that is very specific in the White Paper, however.
What, precisely, can be done about this?
How is the individual citizen to be made to feel more involved in decision-making?
And how, in particular, is the Commission to set about promoting the change of attitude or cultural revolution that has to take place in the Commission if all the reforms are to become a reality?
We are aware that many of Mr Kinnock' s proposed reforms have come up against pretty formidable resistance.
Bureaucracies - and the Commission is a large bureaucracy - change slowly, and many people are impatient to see results.
We cannot afford to fail.
The White Paper is now under consideration. I hope that many will feel prompted to respond and present their views before part two appears.
Parliament will produce a report.
In this connection, it was, moreover, extremely encouraging to hear Mr Prodi propose a joint working party, made up of representatives from the institutions.
I hope that the Commission, together with Parliament, will also be active in making the White Paper more widely known and not expect people just to find it accidentally on the Internet.
Thank you for this first part of the White Paper.
We look forward to seeing part two.

Madam President, Mr Prodi, almost everyone who has spoken has asked - as you yourself have also done - why the EU's image is not what we expect, and why people have ever less faith in it.
I am always surprised that this is commented on in a wounded tone as if we were misunderstood, as if all this were unfair, and even the answers on this subject have a very paternalistic ring about them.
They say that it is all about explaining things better to the public and presenting our policies to them more clearly.
Unlike Mr Swoboda, I do not think that we have really made any progress in this area.
The concept of good governance is very vague, and people do not really understand what you are promising them.
You are promising transparency, openness and consultation, but that is not what is at stake here, Mr Prodi.
The major misunderstanding - I might almost say a misunderstanding of historical proportions - is that this Commission does not have any conception of European democracy.
It has no conception at all of democracy at supranational level.
All these paternalistic ideas that you have presented here miss the point that you do not have the courage - and have not had the courage for years - to highlight the democratic deficits of the European Union with sufficient clarity, and to recognise that the Commission must forego some power if such a thing as European democracy is to exist, and that you need to work alongside this Parliament on many key issues, for example on preparing a constitutional process and the main elements of that process.
No, genuinely tackling the dissatisfaction that exists would mean addressing the state of crisis which exists as regards legitimacy.
We govern people with regulations because we do not have the courage to say that we have been making laws for years now.
We call them regulations because the democratic legitimacy of these laws is very fragile, because the separation of powers has not been achieved, because the principle of openness of legislation has not been achieved, because the process of committing the administration to laws has not been achieved, and because instead there is disproportionate scope for discretion, which cannot be reconciled with democratic principles, because we have an irregular administration in many areas, such as the committee structure. It is not regular, there are no staff regulations, there are no clear loyalties, and the processes for appointing staff in these areas are by no means transparent and are easy to manipulate.
Mr President, you cannot reconcile the idea of a good technocracy with a debate on democracy.
Just as there is no such thing as a good dictatorship, there is also no such thing as a good technocracy.
You will have to address the issue of a European democracy and the position of the Commission in this process.
Madam President, Mr Prodi, I am very pleased that we have another opportunity today to discuss the White Paper together, because European governance is indeed a pivotal theme and I would like to make it very clear that I believe that the whole future viability of the European Union depends to a large extent on this issue.
I am bound to agree with Mr Voggenhuber on this point: as far as I am concerned, the issue at the centre of the whole debate around governance is the question of democracy - strengthening democracy and above all strengthening the public's rights, especially under the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I say that because one thing is clear: the very best policy will achieve nothing if it does not impact on the public or if the present state of affairs continues, in which the public believes that what happens in Brussels is far removed from them and their day-to-day concerns.
I believe, Mr Prodi, that the public quite rightly expects two things: the first is transparency in decision making and the second is clarity as regards political responsibility for decisions.
I believe that this has to be the focal point from which our joint deliberations start, both for the Commission and of course also for the other institutions.
I would like to talk about transparency for a moment.
The White Paper talks about a cumbersome system of almost 700 consultative bodies supporting the Commission.
If I remember correctly, you yourself picked up this point in the White Paper on the reform of the Commission, and announced back in June that a list of these consultative bodies would be published.
In the White Paper before us, you promise that details of these bodies will be published by the end of the year.
I am very much in favour of that.
This is a question of transparency, and it could help to remove some of the prejudice against the work of the Commission and the other institutions.
However, publishing details of consultative bodies is one thing, and, as I see it, accepting political responsibility for decisions is quite another.
A second point in the White Paper that I would like to mention is the 'culture of consultation and dialogue' .
I certainly regard that as a very good proposal.
I think that the Commission on the one hand and the Council and Parliament on the other would be well advised to jointly consider how a new culture of consultation and dialogue can be achieved in terms of greater involvement for civil society.
I think it would be better if the Commission did not propose a code of conduct on minimum standards for consultation for itself, but rather if we could jointly consider whether there is not some scope for all three institutions to make a joint commitment under an Interinstitutional Agreement.
You spoke earlier about a dialogue of this kind, about the possibility of setting up a working party, and I am keen to accept that suggestion.
Madam President, President Prodi, I speak on behalf of the radical Members.
Mr Prodi, what impression do you think the citizens of Europe can have if, after the attacks on New York and Washington, they have seen Chirac, Blair, Fischer and all the European leaders marching off to Washington, and then the President-in-Office and President Prodi a good last, or nearly so - through no fault of their own, of course - and it even seems on Monday - and that is saying something - even Berlusconi may go?
All this in itself reveals a deep-seated problem for as long as we give that impression (and we either give it or not).
Therefore, in my opinion (and here I agree with Mr Voggenhuber), the Commission should stop talking so much and risking being misunderstood, especially in view of the Convention - which we hope will be a positive step and will give a boost to this Union. Instead, it should concentrate on crucial problems like representation abroad, which is its own role; it should reassume its role as the driving force behind European integration, something it is losing and may lose forever.
It should also be daring and make ambitious proposals, such as asking, for instance, what face Europe is showing to the outside world, since we cannot really have ten different faces on such international matters.
This, then, is my message to you, Mr Prodi: more concrete proposals, stronger proposals, particularly in view of the post-Laeken meeting.
Madam President, is not the real reason for this glossy brochure and this debate today the fact that the Treaty of Nice is dead?
The Irish people saw to that, and you know that if you ask them again they will reject it a second time.
It is interesting to note that they were the only people who were asked whether or not they wanted the Treaty.
That is why we have European governance and why you are seeking to push through the institutional changes, choosing a different method.
The only way that you will achieve the participation in this European project that you want is through consent.
By that I do not mean the consent of a House like this, but of the ordinary voters in Europe.
Let us have more referendums in all Member States.
That is the only way to achieve democratic legitimacy.
The way to address the democratic deficit is to give people a chance to express their opinions.
Madam President, there is every reason for developing ideas around the subject of how Europe is to move forward, but there is also a need to know what it is that has to be developed.
Not everything has to be included, but just those things that cannot better be taken care of at national, local or individual levels, such as the internal market, the common currency, external and internal security, borders, customs and certain environmental issues.
So far, the proposals relating to democracy are not sufficiently concrete.
We therefore need cooperation across the institutions in order to move forward.
We must build upon a clear division of power in which political responsibility can be insisted upon.
The objectives need to be clarified and the initiatives adapted accordingly.
It is necessary to be able to hold people to account in a democratic system governed by law, and the prerequisite for this is a common basis of values with clear guidelines.
An effective European democracy requires discussions across linguistic and national borders, together with an education system and media adapted in the light of these.
The proposed multi-level democracy can contribute to legitimacy and greater confidence in the institutions, but it must not degenerate into a democracy characterised by bargaining or corporatism and which is so often marked by corruption.
Cooperation with civil society can make political measures better suited to their purpose, but the role of politicians must be clearly distinguished from civil society.
We now hope that the Commission will in future comply with the values in the proposal and, faced with each new initiative, ask four questions: Is the measure proportionate, that is to say appropriate to the problems that are to be solved?
Is the solution in keeping with European democracy?
Is the proposal in line with the EU' s vision and basic principles?
Can people be held to account?
The more people are involved in European cooperation, the better.
Do not imagine, however, that legitimacy in itself creates democracy. Rather, it is democracy which creates legitimacy.
Madam President, Mr Swoboda has clearly formulated the stance of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and has presented a clear proposal to the Commission.
In my capacity of shadow rapporteur for the PSE Group for the White Paper on Reform of European Governance in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I would now like to explain our position from my point of view.
We welcome your proposal for efficient governance by setting up autonomous agencies, the proposals facilitating co-regulations and self-regulations, the will to consult representatives from specific sectors and the proposal on citizens' and the civil society' s right to information, participation and consultation.
We object, however, to a deal between the interested sectors and the European Commission without any parliamentary control.
That is not our idea of democracy.
We want to decide beforehand, in tandem with the Commission and the Council, when detailed legislation is necessary, when framework legislation suffices and when we can sanction a form of co-regulation or self-regulation.
It goes without saying that in many cases, it will be useful to delegate technical details to the comitology procedure, provided they are technical details, and the political component has been extracted completely.
Furthermore, the call-back mechanism, to which the European Parliament can refer, should this prove necessary, must be regulated in advance.
It is possible that the deployment of the social actors in the case of self- and co-regulation is a much more efficient way of working.
Not only should we consult the sectors about the decision-making process.
In certain cases, even social non-profit organisations could also play a role in the implementation.
But if the sectors are allocated certain tasks, the monitoring role by the European Parliament must always remain clear, and the European Commission must carry its responsibility.
Clarity always remains condition No 1.
The dialogue with social actors must be concrete and yield results, and must not become a talk shop which thrives on repetition.
For what the citizen and the PSE Group want is result: democratic control and recognisable political priority by the European government.
At present, decision-making in the EU is too diffuse and too sluggish, which leads to alienation.
The PSE Group, also in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is now offering to break this cycle.
That is possible and should be done before the Laeken Summit.
The Commission should then reach an agreement with the European Parliament which can be implemented by the end of the Spanish Presidency.
The ball is now back in the court of the Commission.
We count on you, Mr Prodi.
Madam President, President Prodi, at first sight the White Paper might seem tied down to its essentially technical content.
If, instead, we consider the reasons why it was drawn up - reasons that should have been given greater coverage in the text itself - we realise that it has a very solid and highly relevant political core.
In the G8 debate here in this House, I pointed out that, while globalisation is proceeding apace in all fields, it is hard for it to involve politics, which thus remains inadequate and slow compared with what is happening in other sectors.
This is undoubtedly one of the basic reasons for citizens' widespread mistrust of institutions at all levels, from local to European to worldwide.
Besides, what do the people of Seattle, Gothenburg or Genoa, leaving aside the more extreme positions, want of politics, if not to control globalisation?
What answer are we in a position to give, today, apart from our own inadequacy?
The European Union project is, of course, still the only concrete example that can meet these demands, but it has not yet expressed its democratic potential to the full.
The White Paper is thus a valuable instrument, provided Parliament shows the same willingness to specify those substantial organisational reforms that will enable it to reconstruct and revive European democratic citizenship.
Madam President, I would like to move the debate on to ground which has not been much talked about and to the remarks Mr Prodi made in his introductory statement about the regional element.
I would like to do so particularly from the standpoint of my own constituency, Scotland, but not only from that point of view.
It is interesting to note, when you reflect on Scotland, that about 80% of the competences exercisable by the Scottish Parliament concern domains in which the European Union has a shared competence.
When we make laws here, the Scottish Parliament and government are bound by them and have to put them into effect; that is quite right and it is the same across other similar regions.
But sometimes it can produce ridiculous results, for example when environmental laws are too detailed to allow sensible local discretion in adapting common principles to local situations.
The water problems of the Island of Islay or the Glen of Strathspey are hardly comparable with those of the Rhine basin.
A one-size-fits-all approach to water law can have absurd results, for example in respect of the Scotch malt whisky industry, despite its established environmental friendliness over 200 years.
The White Paper says, as did Commissioner Prodi this morning, that the Commission will consult regional and local government early in the policy-formation process and will seek to legislate so that local knowledge is effectively deployed in the implementation process.
That is quite right and very welcome, though it was a pity he only devoted one sentence in his opening speech to it.
Many of us had expected that the White Paper would contain a far stronger statement, especially in relation to the so-called partner regions exercising their own constitutional powers of legislation.
Europe will fail to regain or retain the affections of the citizens of the Union - and that includes the people in Scotland and our counterparts in many similar lands such as Catalonia, Flanders, Wales, Galicia, the Basque country - unless the regional and local governments with whom people there finally identify are fully respected partners in the governance of Europe.
We are the same size and population as many of the existing Member States, the same as many of the adjoining States and we are bigger than quite a few of them.
It is often said that big, important regions of large countries do better in the Union than small Member States.
I doubt it and nothing in the White Paper has yet persuaded me that is true.
Mr Prodi, your paper on European governance is an important milestone, but on a technical issue my colleague, Mr Dell'Alba, pointed out to you in a previous debate that, while the word 'governance' may be very common in the English and French languages, in Italian political culture it is to some extent opaque.
If that is the case, it may well be that we have to get the message through in each of the EU languages.
Perhaps attention could be paid to those languages in which the word 'gouvernance' , first used by Sir John Fortescue in England in the fifteenth century when the English political class spoke French, is less clearly understood than in English and French.
We ought to look at that point.
Reading your paper, it struck me that in a sense the first stage of recovery in the building of Europe is for the Commission itself to recover its self-confidence and poise.
I pay credit to you Mr Prodi, and to your colleagues Mr Patten, Mr Barnier and others, for having succeeded in restoring this poise after the resignation of your predecessors.
However, as you know - and you drew attention to this in your speech - there is concern in Parliament about giving respect to the institutional triangle.
There are fears about your use of civil society, which we all know really means consulting lobby groups.
The most effective lobby groups do their job, which is not to represent society at large - that is this elected Parliament's duty - but to represent their own vested interest.
So I am afraid the fact that you drew attention to this concern has not allayed our fears and we will continue to insist that it is we, the elected Members of this House, who represent the interests of society at large and you should not set up groups meeting directly with the Commission, evolving policy and then handing it down to us to rubber-stamp.
That is not our understanding of parliamentary democracy.
I am sorry that Mr Farage has left.
He obviously does not believe in parliamentary democracy.
He wants a referendum every five minutes.
It is absurd that in my own country, once the Prime Minister, Mr Blair, summons up the courage to confront the Chancellor, Mr Brown, we will be asked in a referendum to decide whether or not to join the single currency.
Can you imagine our financial and economic future being discussed in public houses up and down the country?
This is a job that elected politicians should do.
As regards your paper, the European Parliament and the Commission should be partners in the construction of Europe, not rivals.
If we remember the days of Jacques Delors, your predecessor, he had a clear programme, a vision: the 1992 single market.
He set out a time frame and turned that vision into reality.
We must do the same with enlargement and constitutional reform, widening and deepening.
Lastly, Mr Prodi, will you organise a public platform for the leaders of the candidate countries that will be joining the EU?
I know you have already met the new Polish leader, but the public at large needs to be able to see in practice that we have a vision of a fully complete, united Europe and that you, Parliament and the Council are working together to achieve this.
Madam President, I would first like to congratulate Mr Beazley on his excellent speech.
Mr Prodi, I would like to thank you for making it clear here today that you will not be bringing forward any proposals to amend the constitutional position unless you have the consent of the European Parliament and without a clear vote by Parliament as a directly elected body.
That is more than we have been told so far, and I am delighted about that.
At the same time I would like to thank you for trying to clear up any misunderstandings.
However, there are some things I am still not clear about.
I hope that you will be able to deal with those in your reply as well.
You said that fewer proposals would be emanating from the Commission.
There can be no objection to that, as long as you can tell us how this new vacuum is to be filled, because you know - just as my fellow Members and I do - that the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice stipulated very clearly the legislative role of the European Parliament and the roles of the Commission and the Council.
If you are now telling us that the Commission will be making fewer proposals, one of the implications of that is that you will be presenting framework proposals.
If that is what you intend, Mr Prodi, then you will have to ensure that there is a call-back mechanism and a comitology reform.
This is not just a drawback of the present system, as you just suggested, but rather an absolute necessity in the context of the ideas or proposals that you have for the future.
No one in this House wants framework proposals, but if you want them, then you must make sure they go hand in hand with proper democratic measures that do not adversely affect Parliament's rights.
You say that you want more modern measures such as voluntary commitments; no one in this House wants that.
However, if you still want that, you will have to protect democratic rights within the European Union and ensure that there is an Interinstitutional Agreement that leaves the rights of Parliament, the Council and the Commission intact.
You also said that the White Paper opens up the way for an interinstitutional debate.
It certainly does that.
But I would ask you, Mr Prodi, to state clearly before us that you do not intend to go back on the Treaties of Maastricht, Nice and Amsterdam, and that you share the views of the majority of the Members of this House about what I have said.
Not a single piece of legislation should go through without the European Parliament being involved.
There should not be any voluntary agreements and there should not be any framework agreements unless democracy is protected.
Mr President, I have three points.
Firstly, this paper is slightly more modest than its title suggests.
When you first titillated us with the prospect of presenting this White Paper over a year ago, we were all very excited at the idea of having some great constitutional blueprint.
In fact, you have very wisely produced a paper on good administration rather than a blueprint on governance or constitutional government as a whole, and that pragmatic and focused approach has much to commend it.
Secondly, I very much welcome your announcement today that you wish to establish an interinstitutional working party.
I have always felt it was a mistake to try to treat governance as if it were a piece of legislation which was first presented by the Commission and then batted between the institutions.
This is not normal legislation, but an intensely political debate that requires an intensely political and cooperative approach between the institutions.
My final point is one that you touch upon quite politely in the White Paper.
I will be less polite: we can do as much as we like at European level - in Strasbourg and Brussels - to improve administration and governance and make our decisions more comprehensible, legitimate and understandable.
However, as long as national political institutions and national political cultures remain frozen in the 19th-century mould and pretend that either the EU does not exist or is some far-off spaceship, we will never make great advances in this honourable enterprise of improving governance.
Governance can only be built brick by brick from the bottom, from the ground floor, from our nations and regions.
That is where we should all start.
Mr President, I think that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has expressed Parliament' s concerns in her main point.
Parliament does not think it is a bad idea for the Commission to set up all the consultative bodies it wants, that it should meet with all the non-governmental organisations it wishes, that it should consult everyone through the Internet, or that it should talk to all citizens on a personal level.
This seems like a good idea to us and we should probably do the same thing.
What worries us is the second part of the White Paper; or to be more precise, the proposals to improve Community regulations.
The Treaties of the European Union - as Mrs Roth-Behrendt pointed out - are based upon the principle of the division of powers.
Article 6 of the Treaty makes reference to national constitutional principles.
All national legislations are based upon the principle of the division of powers, by which legislative prerogatives are under the control of bodies elected by the people.
In the case of the European institutions there are two such bodies: the Parliament, directly elected, and the Council, comprised of Ministers responsible to their own national Parliaments.
The role of the Commission of the European Communities is to be the Community executive, and the role of Parliament is to support and strengthen the claims of the Commission to be an authentic Community executive.
However, if the Commission enters into the regulatory framework and endeavours to take on competences or powers that have been conferred or that should be conferred on the European Parliament by the Treaties, in these areas - as Mr Swoboda and Mrs Roth-Behrendt have stated - the Commission must remain in close contact with Parliament.
To be precise, Mr Prodi' s suggestion that the Commission could present the Laeken European Council with proposals on improving Community regulations, without waiting for Parliament to deliver its opinion, seems to me to be a dangerous thing.
I hope that the Commission, before putting forward any proposal to the Laeken European Council on improving Community regulations, enters into close contact with Parliament with the aim of listening to our point of view and in this way conveying to the Laeken European Council the Parliament' s concerns and interests in this matter.
Mr President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, this debate on the Commission's White Paper on European Governance in some ways comes at a bad time, and in other ways at a good one.
It is a bad time because any debate on the internal structure of the European Union and the way it functions, and on the legitimacy of the European Union itself will at present be dwarfed by the need to protect Europe's citizens against international terror and violence, with more arcane subjects being overshadowed.
However, it is also a good time for the same reason, by which I mean that the European Union has an opportunity at this precise moment to respond to people's fundamental need for safety within the EU, and for legitimacy combined with an ability to act outside its own borders.
Transparent, open and accountable decision making can accordingly help to make Europe's citizens more aware and at the same time conscious of the added value Europe can bring.
Your White Paper is a contribution to that added value, Mr Prodi.
Against this background, I particularly welcome those proposals in the Commission's White Paper that aim for a systematic dialogue at regional and local level, at a more active role for the Committee of the Regions, and the proposal that from 2002 onwards there should be an annual report on the implementation of the Amsterdam Protocol on Subsidiarity and Proportionality.
Subsidiarity and the Community method are not after all mutually exclusive.
The division of tasks between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament must be clear, just as a balance between the Member States, the regions and the EU needs to be struck under their institutional triangle.
It is obvious that the European Parliament and the national parliaments should play a central role in the public debate on the future of Europe.
That is why I find it amazing that in its White Paper the Commission does not consider the idea of a convention as requested in the report by Mr Leinen and Mr Méndez de Vigo.
An open convention which works out the decision-making basis for the Council, with representatives from the Commission and from national parliaments and from the European Parliament, together with representatives of the Member States and the candidate countries and from the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee sitting as observers, is an appropriate and essential forum for bringing the Union closer to its citizens and achieving transparency, and it must supplement and support internal reforms.
Mr President, it is indeed a shame that Mr Farage is no longer with us.
He obviously has learned nothing about public policy if he thinks that we can run the whole of Europe on a series of referendums.
This discussion is probably one of the most important that we will have before enlargement.
It is neither as hallowed nor as sexy as an IGC, but until we get the actual delivery mechanisms of democracy and public policy right, the boring, tedious administrative detail, then we do democracy an injustice.
We have to reform our governmental processes.
There are many proposals in the White Paper that cause nobody any problems, but issues like co-regulation and the delivery of public policy by external agencies do cause problems.
We cannot afford not to address these issues.
Our institutional overload, as we all know, is quite dramatic in the Union and with enlargement it will get worse.
We need to ensure, however, that when we reform those processes - whether it be issues concerning co-regulation or external agencies - we see democratic control as the key factor, democratic control in a democratic framework.
This will not be a resource-free exercise.
It will also require significant person power to deliver it, at least in the early stages.
The Commission has to face this.
It will not be a cost-cutting exercise by any means.
Finally, if there is a criticism that has to be made of the Commission, and I am glad it has realised the importance of this criticism, it is that its White Paper did not address the role of Parliament.
Now I realise that the Commission might be sensitive about doing so, in case it brings the wrath of this House down on it.
That represented a fundamental failure in the early discussions between the Commission and Parliament.
So I am very pleased that this has now been rectified and we can move forward to produce the sort of governmental structure which we require.
Mr President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, in support of what Mrs Stenzel has just said, I would like to add that it is never too late and never too soon to hold a debate of this kind.
At this particular point I believe that the events of recent weeks have brought more seriousness into politics and that the public is making greater demands on politicians.
This provides an opportunity to contribute to a renaissance of political matters and also to a significant renaissance of cooperation between leaders, those in positions of responsibility and the representatives of the people, that is to say the parliaments.
That is how we should approach this debate.
When you say in the introduction to your paper that the public feels greater distrust, more apathy and more powerlessness, I agree with you. However, in your second paragraph you say that this problem is acknowledged by national parliaments and governments alike, and that it is particularly acute at the level of the European Union.
I have a problem with this wording.
We - Parliament and the Commission - are acting as if national governments and national parliaments were on one side and the European Union on the other.
The public is particularly aware of this contradiction, with the Member States and the European institutions apparently on opposite sides.
We need to make it clear for once and all that we collectively are the European Union!
There is virtually no such thing as a European decision without the participation of the national governments, but there are a good many European decisions without codecision by the European Parliament.
Codecision leads to transparency and openness and facilitates dialogue, and is therefore the starting point for a clear separation of powers and allocation of tasks.
Your report talks about leadership.
I wish to call for more Commission initiatives based not so much on a minimum Council consensus but rather on what Europe needs.
It talks about cooperation with the regions, yet in the Belgian Presidency's proposal for the convention the Commission of the Regions is not even a full member of that convention.
Yet that is what we need.
We talk about more information, but our actions are limited to giving the Member States more money for their information work, while the Member States do not give their own parliaments sufficient information about their decisions in the Council, and therefore exclude their citizens from European decision making.
By way of conclusion, I wish to call for proposals for sanctions in the case of misuse of EU funds, because that leads to distrust about the institutions on the part of the public.
Wherever the EU is involved, that must be made evident, from the European institutions themselves to the smallest local council.
Mr President, Mr Prodi, the White Paper calls on Parliament to enhance its role in feeding the views of its electors into the political debate.
But this means, Mr Prodi, and I must stress this point, that in the twenty-first century democracy will continue to be associated with the word 'parliamentary' and not with the word 'consultative' .
We do not want to go back to the pre-parliamentary democracy era and the White Paper should not be associated with that idea.
Framework legislation and the use of other regulatory mechanisms can only be something positive if they are linked with appropriate guarantees.
In the case of framework legislation the effect of these guarantees should be to ensure that the power to define is not handed over to some agency or other, but is reserved to Parliament.
It is not only Parliament's privilege to insist on this, it is Parliament's duty.
You say that you want more transparency and consultation, but whom are you excluding and whom are you including?
Associations and non-governmental organisations that can pay for expertise will be better off than those who do not have these resources.
And in practice some people will surely be better able to make their voice heard than others.
Will this not mean that we are making the playing field for the various parts of civil society in the European Union still more uneven?
I believe in a level playing field for the various actors and institutions.
I believe that the White Paper is not clear enough about this.
I call on you to make this clear, because I have to say that when it comes to financial market legislation, the implementation of the Commission's financial action plan tends to give one co-legislator a stronger position than the other co-legislator, the European Parliament.
That does not seem a very promising road to go down.
This imbalance needs to be rectified, and at the next intergovernmental conference Article 202 of course needs to be amended by creating a call-back right.
However, the Commission could also demonstrate its good will at this stage and make it clear that it does not intend to surreptitiously change the balance between the institutions.
We, as a parliament, owe that much to society, because parliamentary activity does not just mean controlling things, but also shaping them.
I do not want to leave that task to a variety of committees chaired by people without any democratic legitimacy and who are not co-elected by Parliament, as is the case in the United States for example.
(Applause)
Mr President, I am very glad that you are being very tolerant on time this morning.
It is a well-known saying that 'if you don't know where you're going, then you won't get there' .
First and foremost we need to be very clear in Europe about what we are doing; our aim is not to create a single State of Europe, but to have a union of sovereign States that are cooperating when and where necessary.
Unlike Mr Farage, I believe there are many occasions when it is important that we cooperate in Europe.
Equally we all know that the none of the institutions are held in high regard.
That is not because they are bad. It is because they are complex, remote and not understood.
Frankly, we will continue to face the same problem, whatever specific reforms we come up with, if they remain obscure, complex and unexplained.
I say to my colleagues in this Chamber that one thing the people of Europe do not understand is why we oscillate between Brussels and Strasbourg.
It is up to us to listen to some of the problems that people express to us.
I was disappointed in President Prodi's White Paper.
He virtually neglected the role of the ombudsman.
After all, the ombudsman is in the front line of dealing with the complaints and concerns of citizens.
I was also disappointed last month by the response of Commissioner de Palacio, whom I normally respect, who was quite dismissive about the code of good administrative behaviour.
We must make sure that we have good administration.
That means that we must have an enforceable code common to all of the institutions.
The Committee on Petitions has asked the Ombudsman to report to us on the problems that citizens are presenting to him.
We want to listen to citizens.
I extend an invitation to President Prodi, if he really wants to understand what the citizens of Europe are finding difficult with the European institutions, European rules and regulations, to give up one afternoon and come along to the Petitions Committee to listen to what citizens are saying.
He would certainly have an afternoon's entertainment hearing what people really think.
In brief, what I am saying is this: listen to people; listen to those who know what they are talking about; be clear about your objectives; and then explain yourselves in clear and simple language.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Prodi for having clarified in his speech certain points which, from a reading of the White Paper, could have given rise to misunderstandings.
Today' s debate on governance is important because it aims at encouraging broader discussion on the meaning of European integration and its goals.
It complements the debate on the future of the Union, and thus it should concentrate on the connection between general objectives and the concrete actions seen by the citizens.
As we all know, what really lies at the basis of this deliberation is the realisation that the long-term credibility of European integration is undermined by the lack of mutual recognition between public structures and civil society.
We must therefore involve numerous sections and expressions of civil society to the greatest extent possible, because in this way the citizens will also be playing a greater part in policy- and decision-making. This is an important task that the institutions of the European Union must all make a real effort to carry out together.
To this end, I would recall that during the last Parliamentary term the European Parliament itself, and in particular the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, recognised the need to initiate and formalise a dialogue with civil society.
To do this an effort must be made to identify the most representative groups, so as to avoid an excess of consultations and overlapping.
We therefore ask for an Interinstitutional Agreement on this, which will lead to a division of labour and, at the same time, collaboration between Commission, Parliament and Council.
A second important point, which has already been hinted at, is the need to simplify Community legislative procedures, distinguishing, that is, between political and legislative decisions, which must not become detailed technical instruments; and distinguishing between Parliament' s prerogatives and competences that belong to the executive.
Something that you, Mr Prodi, have mentioned is therefore important: the need to specify a call-back mechanism for secondary legislation which can safeguard and strengthen the role of the European Parliament.
Mr President, as the last speaker from my group and as coordinator of the group, it falls to me to try and summarise the positions that have been expressed.
Listening to the debate I feel that our group's views are very much the centre of gravity of Parliament as a whole on this question.
If I could try and summarise this in two sentences, it would be to say 'yes' to better information, consultation and more systematic consultation of non-governmental actors and so on, but 'no' to delegating decisions to a sort of cosy deal between the Commission and industry.
We would say 'yes' to delegating technical and implementing legislation, but only if there is an adequate procedure to bring things back if they go wrong.
In other words, there is considerable sympathy in Parliament for much of what the Commission intends to achieve in its White Paper but genuine concern about what might be the real effects of some of the proposals therein.
Let me take the example that has come up recently of the self-regulation on pedestrian safety, where the Commission has made a deal with the automobile industry.
This is a very good deal in many ways and a lot of what has been agreed is a good step forward for pedestrians' safety.
But what if it were not very good?
What if it contained some outrageous things that would not be acceptable to this Parliament representing the citizens?
We represent all the citizens of Europe not just those who are organised in NGOs.
What if the automobile industry subsequently does not apply the deal, because it is not enshrined in legislation?
What can we do to remedy the situation if one or the other manufacturer does not respect the deal?
That is the sort of concern that is being expressed in this Parliament.
I welcome the commitment of the Commission only to take this forward once Parliament has given its view and to explore these issues further in an inter-institutional working party.
That is a very welcome development.
I am very glad you gave that undertaking today and I look forward to taking this matter further.
Mr President, honourable Members, I am very pleased with today' s debate, since it has shown that our positions are converging, we agree on most points and, most importantly, we share working methods.
I would say we have laid the groundwork so that, together, we can conclude this period of reforms under the present legislation.
A common concern has also emerged which, even though it was not part of today' s debate, is closely associated with it: a common concern for a Europe that should speak with a single voice and interpret people' s growing anxieties about the institutions. These anxieties affect not only our Member States but also the enlargement States, where there is a growing problem of distrust towards the European institutions.
In this respect, many criticisms have been raised concerning the plurality of the voices of Europe, a plurality which Europe took to Washington after the tragedy.
Let us not confuse this with plurality of presence.
The content was absolutely identical: in Washington we spoke with a single voice, and after the discussions we left President Bush with the European position, which was a highly operational position, with specific areas for collaboration in justice and internal affairs and the financial problem of money recycling, fields in which we proposed lines of action on which Europe should come together.
I believe part of the citizens' anxieties derive from the complexity of our working procedures and the fact that they are hard to understand, problems that the White Paper attempts to address - partially, at least - through enhancements to the democratic system and transparency and through greater efficiency and speed in decision-making, while fully respecting or rather increasing the prerogatives of Parliament.
I confirm, then, at the end of this short debate, that we intend to arrive at a clarification of our respective functions, but no one questions the role of the European Parliament and the Council in holding political control over the Commission' s executive work.
Not only do we acknowledge this control but - I recall what Mr Corbett said in the last speech - we believe this control is absolutely essential.
I also confirm - and here I must confess that the misunderstanding arose from a mistake by the Commission, something it expressed poorly - that the Commission does not intend to take any decision, either prior to Laeken or at any other time, without first listening to Parliament.
We had insisted on the need for decisions to be made quickly, but in every case we must first consult Parliament fully.
Anyway, today we have made some progress.
Mrs Kauffmann and others have made some extremely useful suggestions.
The idea of organising a joint Parliament-Council-Commission working party to establish a code of institutional behaviour in the framework of the existing rules is a path I think we should explore.
We need to be clear about this aim; that is, we must set up a procedure to streamline the decision-making process, because, I repeat, it is slow and poorly understood. The new procedure must make it unnecessary to systematically resort to committee procedures without detracting at all from the powers of Parliament and the Council, but rather enhancing their political responsibility.
The Commission is willing to examine this path.
With all honesty and without any ulterior motive, I wonder whether the Council will be willing to do so; we, in any case, are.
For this to happen, I ask Parliament to be politically determined and insist on this approach.
This discussion also prepares for the debate on the future of Europe, which is to be organised by the Convention.
If we start out now in the directions outlined here, I believe it will help us later to find the institutionally most appropriate solutions.
Today there was one point of formal divergence that we should discuss in the area we have described, which is the procedure termed 'call-back' .
I believe the current committee system is a distortion of democracy, which is why we have looked at it critically.
It mixes legislative and executive functions, without there being any real political control.
The call-back proposal apparently improves the situation, but in fact it makes the system more confusing because it makes it more difficult to separate our functions and see the difference between them.
I think this is an area we should focus on in a future meeting of the bodies we have proposed, in order to clear up this point: we must work together for a system in which the Commission executes and the European Parliament and the Council exercise political control before measures are adopted.
If there is always this possibility of call-back, Parliament will obviously end up taking on a strictly executive function.
I repeat: let us work on it, because not only am I being perfectly sincere but it is absolutely clear in my mind that this is an extremely delicate point of democratic control.
We should use the same methodology with the agency problem.
The Commission believes that in some cases they are necessary, but we must not multiply them ad infinitum. We should turn to them only when there are highly complex technical roles and they have an autonomy of their own.
We agree with you that democratic control over these agencies is needed, control that should take three forms: when the agency is set up, and Parliament plays a fundamental part in this decision together with the Council; when its budget is checked, and it is Parliament that checks it; and when a check is made on the workings of the Commission, which is the body responsible for these agencies.
This, then, is the Commission' s position.
Two other points have emerged here: these are points included in the White Paper or connected with it although not actually included in it. They are participation by civil society and the problem of participation by the regions and autonomous local areas.
I believe it is essential for the regions and local administrations to play an active role, and in the forthcoming Convention too.
If we really define Europe as the Europe of subsidiarity, we must be consistent to some degree at least, and on this I have no reservations at all.
On the problem of consulting with civil society, if we read the White Paper carefully there is no expropriation of Parliamentary, democratically elected bodies.
On the contrary, there is a different discourse: whereas now civil society is consulted privately and indirectly, we are proposing that such consultation should be transparent and in the open, so that everyone can see where particular ideas and positions arose or where certain suggestions come from.
This, to me, is a step forward.
I understand I may have created concern because, when faced with such clear evidence of a process, Parliament may say, 'But that is our job!'
I can assure you that we have the opposite objective: we must consult civil society because it is useful for us and it is useful for you, but consulting means consulting; it is absolutely unacceptable that this should be seen as an alternative form of decision-making that could be confused with or compared to that of Parliament.
I say this quite clearly because you will never have heard the Commission proposing, for instance, to bring civil society into the Convention in a role involving decision-making aspects.
I do think, however, that transparent, clear consultation is a step forward that we really should take.
I repeat: it has never been our intention to attribute an institutional or constitutional role to consultations with civil society, even though we are concerned to understand what is happening within that society, and thus to keep our eyes open and ears tuned, ever alert to whatever is happening.
In a certain sense it is like the suggestion made by Mr Perry to attend the Committee on Petitions, in order to keep our eyes open.
In any case, please remember that the Commission' s proposal has two objectives: first, a more parliamentary democracy; and secondly, a more efficient democracy.
In the discussion on the relationship with Parliament, the call-back problem lies in this context.
We want a more parliamentary democracy in which the role of Parliament is clear and precise, but also more efficient, one in which the executive role is not continually called into debate by procedures.
I believe this could be clarified with the proposal of working together on these issues over the coming months. This may be beneficial and lead to progress in future in our way of working, under existing legislation for the time being, in expectation of the great institutional reform process which should start after the Laeken Summit.
Thank you very much, Mr Prodi.
If I may, I would like to add that with the Charter of Fundamental Rights we had very positive experience of involving civil society, but we did not have any Members in the Convention.
Mr President, there has probably been a translation problem.
I shall repeat the sentence which is the key to the latter part of my speech: we have never said - and I confirm this today - that civil society can play a decision-making role.
That is reserved for Parliament and the Council - our institutions.
We simply want consultation to take place more transparently, more clearly and more comprehensively.
Thank you very much, Mr Prodi!
I think that really does make things clearer.
A few Members were actually somewhat surprised, but I think that we all know what was meant now.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you now have the floor.
As you know, if the Commission President wishes to add anything else, we will of course be happy to agree to that.
Asylum and immigration
The next item is the joint debate on asylum and immigration policy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and a great honour for me, in my capacity as chairman of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, to report to you on the work which we are doing on asylum and immigration, but also to inform you of the initiatives planned by the presidency for the coming weeks.
The fact that I have been given the opportunity to speak on this particular day is all the more appropriate given that your Parliament is being called to vote on two reports, which are of a very high quality and which are particularly important for our future work in the Justice and Home Affairs Council: Mr Pirker's report on the Commission communication on a Community immigration policy and Mr Evans's report on the Commission communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status, valid throughout the Union, for persons granted asylum.
When I introduced the presidency' s programme to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I mentioned the fact that our presidency had made these two areas - asylum on the one hand and immigration on the other - a priority, and said that there were several reasons for our doing so.
First of all, I note, echoing my European colleagues, that the public have a genuine expectation here, a legitimate expectation, and it is our duty as politicians to respond to this urgently, of course, but also, I believe, to provide some reassurance.
This implies managing migratory flows effectively and it also means that we need to take measures to prevent the asylum procedure from being abused.
We have to recognise that there is widespread concern about the upward trend in the figures which we are seeing more or less everywhere in Europe.
Secondly, the evaluation of Tampere, which will be carried out at the end of our presidency, should allow us to identify the areas in which progress has been made in the field of justice and home affairs, but also to propose measures with a view to remedying any shortcomings revealed as soon as possible, and we have to admit that there are some.
To avoid the regrettable consequences of these shortcomings, we think that it is necessary to relaunch the political process at the Laeken Summit.
To do this we will need to resolve several issues which, though in the guise of technical difficulties, are in fact the subject of political dispute.
I must in addition thank Commissioner Vitorino who always puts forward very sensible proposals, but has also proven to be very open-minded in his concern to make progress and who is willing for his proposals to be challenged if this moves the issue forward at European level.
With these two points in mind, the Belgian Presidency wanted even now to create the necessary political impetus to provoke a substantial debate on issues such as establishing a common and balanced immigration policy and setting up a European asylum system.
In other words, we are working with our colleagues in this presidency to ensure that the Council of Ministers is once again able to play its role as architect of the European edifice and thus focus on settling a number of political disputes.
Its legislative work should lead to visible operational activity and cooperation on practical matters between the law enforcement agencies and the immigration authorities.
I have to tell you that for my part I am convinced that a common European approach, based on solidarity, is the only viable approach to these matters.
We should remember that for a long time many Member States believed that they could tackle this problem on their own. They have to admit, however, that the results have not come up to expectations.
Let me take asylum first of all.
The right to asylum is, of course, a priority for all of our countries.
Europe' s dignity would not, I believe, allow otherwise.
We still wish to see the Geneva Convention applied in full and compliance with it reaffirmed.
It seems to me that in this respect our countries have nothing to be ashamed of.
The efforts which we are making to meet our international commitments cannot be challenged or called into question.
However, it is also apparent to all of us that large numbers of people are using this procedure as a way of entering the territory of our Member States for reasons other than those laid down in the Geneva Convention.
I therefore think that we ought to consider what action we might take in the light of these two observations.
In just a few months, the Commission has completed a significant task, producing the proposals for directives which we now need to examine and which concern: harmonising the conditions for the reception of applicants for asylum; harmonising the procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status; revising the Dublin Convention; harmonising refugee status and, finally, subsidiary forms of protection.
Although we need to see all of these texts as part of an indissociable whole, there is good reason to be self-disciplined about the order in which we examine them.
Bearing in mind the timetable set by the Commission scoreboard and the Commission communication on asylum which provides for a two-stage approach, the presidency has decided to focus as a priority on the three following directives: harmonising the common minimum conditions for the reception of asylum-seekers; the Community instrument to succeed the Dublin Convention and harmonising procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status.
The first two documents have had their first reading, which I might describe as encouraging and from which it was clear that Member States wish to make progress in this field as quickly as possible.
As far as harmonising procedures is concerned, I organised an exploratory debate at political level during the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 27 September, based on specific questions which required specific answers.
For example, the Member States had to give their views on how the directive should be structured, and in particular on the criteria to be used to distinguish between admissible applications and manifestly unfounded ones, the number of bodies involved in assessing these criteria, their nature, the appeals mechanism making it possible to refer the matter to them, and how precise to make the qualitative standards for the decisions and the authorities making those decisions.
It was proposed to ministers that the same working method be used to examine the directive on family reunification.
This exercise made it possible - although it is certainly difficult - to make some progress, particularly on defining the notion of the nuclear family.
It is clear that the diversity of the national systems in place in our Member States means that any moves to bring them into line with each other will indisputably and necessarily require significant efforts to be made on all sides.
None of the Member States can hope that the uniform system will correspond to what it has been familiar with at home.
Above and beyond these national differences, however, I did note with satisfaction that we are all working towards the same objective: establishing procedures which are fast and effective - this is very important - but which of course respect the rights of refugee applicants.
The presidency will, moreover, continue to make every effort, working in collaboration with the Commission, to meet this objective as soon as possible.
In addition, I welcome the recommendations made in Mr Evans' s report, which seek to flesh out the provisions in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere conclusions with a view to implementing this common European asylum regime.
Our response to this issue has to be a joint one, based on solidarity.
Europe needs to toe the same political line where admitting refugees onto its territory is concerned and needs to act together to stamp out the underground activity which this provokes.
If we ascertain that procedures are being abused, we obviously need to find solutions to situations of human distress.
Europe needs to work along these lines to improve conflict prevention, and also, through its cooperation programmes, to establish better living conditions throughout the world.
Organising information campaigns in the countries of origin should make it possible to combat illegal immigration, but also to thwart the plans of criminal organisations which are at the origin of this modern form of slavery and which do not hesitate to have recourse to any means, in particular violence and terror, to achieve their ends.
Exploiting these flows of refugee applicants for criminal purposes is an additional concern for the whole of the European Union and it is our duty to respond to this by adopting emergency measures to act as a deterrent.
It was with this in mind that we raised the issue of trafficking in human beings during the open debate with the accession countries at the Council meeting of 28 September and decided on measures to take in this field by adopting operational conclusions.
This package of measures can and must range from measures to protect victims to police-related measures such as reinforcing checks at Europe' s current and future external borders, while safeguarding the possibility for those who are fleeing persecution to find asylum in our countries.
Finally I agree that we need to draw a clear distinction in the measures which we put in place between asylum-seekers looking for international protection and those who want to enter the European Union for other reasons, which are incidentally sometimes legitimate.
At a time of openness and mobility, this is certainly not about transforming Europe into a 'fortress' but about reflecting on how we can manage immigration in a transparent, realistic and balanced way.
I do not have any ready-made answers to these questions; instead we have elected to organise - in collaboration with the European Parliament and the Commission - a European Conference on Migration, which will be held on 16 and 17 October in Brussels.
I should like, Mr President, to take advantage of the fact that this event will soon be upon us to thank you for the considerable support which this Parliament has given us in organising this meeting, which is, I believe, unprecedented, and which will bring together expert observers of these phenomena which are a real problem in today's society.
The Brussels hemicycle of the European Parliament is a prestigious venue and symbolises the fruitful collaboration between the European institutions, which, on an issue such as immigration, is quite obviously vital.
In addition, I hope that many Members of this Parliament will attend the conference, thus fostering a rich and productive debate.
This event, to which we will have the honour of welcoming ministers, senior officials from international institutions and politicians, will provide an opportunity to hold an in-depth political debate on migratory flows, the issues at stake and their consequences.
It will allow us to get a general idea of the way in which migratory flows should be addressed within a common European policy.
At the conference the floor will be open for contributions from all participants which should help us - and this is our political objective - to make some essential choices at the Laeken European Summit.
The idea is to reinject momentum into the search for a global approach towards migration.
Furthermore, we are all aware that these questions of principle conceal a certain tendency for people to exploit the phenomenon for economic and even political ends and we cannot ignore this.
Significant migratory flows head for Europe, either abusing the procedures which were designed for completely different purposes or, even, entering Europe completely illegally, which is of course just as reprehensible.
A large number of these illegal migrants also benefit from criminal help, both abroad and in our own countries.
Obviously these abuses of the system sustain those who try to exploit the migratory phenomena for economic purposes or to achieve political aims and we cannot remain indifferent to this.
I was pleased to see that the issues which will be debated during the conference are the same as those raised in Mr Pirker' s report on immigration.
How can we manage migratory flows successfully?
How can we draw a clear distinction between asylum and immigration?
What impact would relaxing the conditions governing the entry of immigrants have on illegal immigration?
Do our Member States need a new wave of economic migration?
Is this need felt to the same extent across the Union?
What consequences does the fight against the shadow economy have for illegal immigration?
What are the undesirable consequences of the migration of qualified labour and how can we counter them?
In which areas do we work together with the countries of origin?
What instruments can we put in place to establish a genuine policy of integration?
The presidency believes that this is not simply a question of resolving technical issues: everyone knows that these matters are highly charged, economically and politically, but also at a purely human level.
We need to take account of many phenomena, including underground ones, which makes establishing a common immigration policy particularly complex, especially from an economic point of view.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before drawing to a close, I should like to remind you of our desire to work in full institutional collaboration with you, the European Parliament, within the rules laid down in the treaties, in the hope that together we will be able to take further steps towards creating an area of freedom, security and justice which will benefit Europe and the people of Europe.
This is already the third time that I have had the pleasure of addressing you.
This is not an onerous task; it is an honour, and I am delighted to be able to work together with you.
(Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Minister, today' s debate has come at a crucial time: we are two weeks away from the European Conference on Migration, which has been organised by the Belgian Presidency, and two months from the Laeken European Council, which is tasked with carrying out the mid-term review of the Tampere agenda.
Both of these should be essential stages in the process of drawing up common immigration and asylum policies.
In adopting the two resolutions which are on the table today, whose quality and balance should be saluted - and I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Pirker and Mr Evans - the European Parliament will, I am sure, express clear and forceful priorities in good time.
Since the tragic events of 11 September, the European Union has been confronted with a new political agenda in the fields of justice and home affairs.
Thanks in particular to the determination of the Belgian Presidency, it has so far been facing up to this remarkably well.
The European Council of 21 September sent out a very clear message to us.
We should adopt as a matter of urgency the measures necessary to reinforce the internal security of our Member States and their nationals while making the fight against terrorism a priority.
At the same time, however, the European Council of 21 September emphasised that neither should we stop working on other issues set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam and thus towards our objective of safeguarding and developing an area of freedom, security and justice.
I am delighted that the European Council underlined the need to strike a political balance between stepping up police and judicial cooperation with a view to combating crime and terrorism, on the one hand, and establishing an area of freedom, security and justice, that is protecting the fundamental rights of the public, on the other.
I have always stressed in these debates here with the European Parliament, but also with the Council, that we need common immigration and asylum policies more than ever.
The relevance of both the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere conclusions has been repeatedly reaffirmed.
I am convinced that the public genuinely expects, and even demands, the addition of European value to national policies whose limitations are becoming ever more apparent, whether they be security policies or policies to protect civil liberties.
To achieve an objective of this kind and identify the European added value which we can bring to national policies, I believe that we should take into account both the security imperatives and the respect for values which are the common defining values of our European Union, including the freedom of movement which is guaranteed by the Schengen Agreement.
The Council has asked the Commission to evaluate its proposals on asylum and immigration in the light of the terrorist attacks in the United States of America.
We have already buckled down to this task.
The political will to move forward on these matters which was reaffirmed by both the European Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council should give us new hope.
As the Minister emphasised just now, it is true that the slow progress and the difficulties which we have encountered on certain dossiers could cast serious doubt on our ability to take substantial decisions within the very strict deadlines in the Commission timetable.
This new momentum should benefit all aspects of our cooperation on justice and home affairs, provided that the Member States recognise that it is impossible to have European legislation which is a faithful copy of fifteen national laws and that they will each have to give some ground in the search for a common solution from which they will all benefit.
As far as the substance of today' s debate is concerned, I note that there is broad convergence between the Commission' s views and those of Parliament, as reflected in the two excellent reports by Mr Pirker and Mr Evans.
Whether they concern the principles on which the common European asylum regime should be based or the components of a coherent approach towards the migration phenomenon, we do not have any difficulty in going along with most of your recommendations.
In some cases we have even anticipated them and several of your requests are already taken into account in our proposals on the legal status of long-term residents and on admission for employment purposes, or again in our communication of last July which followed on from the one of November 2000 and went into more detail on some of the guidelines.
In other cases, we are preparing to follow them up, for example in the communications which I intend to propose to the Commission for adoption in the coming months, the first of which concerns the fight against illegal immigration and the second repatriation policies and external border checks.
I also share your concern about the need to develop practical proposals to build a real partnership between the Union and the countries of origin and transit.
We have started work on this by setting up a high-level group, whose mandate will be extended thanks to the implementation of a new budgetary instrument with the strong backing of the European Parliament.
Nevertheless, people may feel that this work and the implementation of the action plans adopted by the Council are not bearing sufficient fruit.
I therefore agree that in general we should recognise the significance of these migratory phenomena by giving them greater consideration when we are formulating the European Union' s external policy.
To a certain extent we have to recognise that we are hostages of the division between the second and third pillars, which is completely unjustified because on closer inspection the very close links between the European Union' s development and migration policies become apparent.
I should also insist on the fact that a genuine European policy on immigration and asylum will not exist - over and above the legislative framework - unless national policies also converge in practice and in pursuit of common objectives.
This, then, is the aim of the Commission's proposed open coordination policy, which is similar to the method already used - incidentally with success - for employment, for example.
An open coordination method of this kind seems to me to have the advantages of flexibility and transparency as well as respecting subsidiarity, while providing a powerful incentive to harmonise legislation and national practice - even spontaneously I would say - and being a good indicator of the areas in which Community intervention is really essential.
It requires the Member States to agree in the Council on common guidelines proposed to them by the Commission after a broad process of consultation.
They will then have to implement them at national level using the national legislative and administrative means at their disposal.
The Member States will be invited to draw up national reports every year in which they will have to take stock of the progress which they have made in implementing these common guidelines.
The Commission's summary of these reports should make it possible to identify, on a case-by-case basis, the weak points in the essential convergence exercise and, if necessary, to refine and add to the common guidelines.
In July, we put forward a first set of guidelines concerning the management of migratory flows, the admission of economic migrants, partnership with third countries and the integration of third-country nationals into our societies.
Further proposals will be made for asylum when we publish the first report on the follow-up to our communication of November 2000, which will be sent to you in the coming months.
The Commission hopes that the Council and the European Council will give these new guidelines their blessing so that implementation can start immediately and a first complete round be conducted in the course of next year.
In conclusion, I should like to come back to some fundamental principles which in the current circumstances it is, more than ever, important to reiterate.
First of all, asylum is a right which is guaranteed and regulated by international instruments and confirmed by the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
No one will dispute the fact that it may be abused.
And it is up to us, as politicians, to put a stop to this, not by further weakening the position of those who really need international protection, but - and this is a better bet - by aligning the procedures and criteria applied at national level and making them more effective.
The introduction, in the medium term, of a one-stop shop, which you support in your resolution, would, therefore, unquestionably be a significant step forward in my opinion.
In the meantime, it would seem to be essential to endeavour to improve the quality of initial decisions, as recommended in our proposal on asylum procedures.
Secondly, we cannot deny that immigration occurs.
It would be eminently regrettable if some people were to take advantage of current feeling to revert to a policy of slogans.
Slogans will not resolve the immigration problem.
Above all, name-calling, which is an accessory of racist and xenophobic sentiment, must be avoided.
What we do have is a genuine policy to manage migratory flows at both national and European level.
And the terms of reference would appear to me to be obvious.
Legal immigration channels need to be clearly identified and the possibilities which they represent need to be quantified, not on the basis of the unexpected whims and uncertainties of the economic cycle, but on the basis of a realistic assessment of our societies' structural needs and how many immigrants they would be able to accommodate.
A dialogue with the countries of departure is necessary and it is important to take into account the different types of immigration with which we are faced.
Some immigrants are long-term and are expected to stay in their host societies for good, but others - and there are increasing numbers of them - are part of cyclical migration flows, which implies - and this should be encouraged - that they will maintain a stronger link with their region of origin.
Finally, the credibility of a proactive immigration policy must be consolidated by an effective campaign to combat illegal immigration and the trafficking in human beings which is associated with it.
We should give serious thought to creating a major new Community instrument, alongside those which are designed to combat exclusion, which might, for example, address the specific problem of integrating immigrants.
Today, cultural pluralism is becoming a characteristic of our societies, particularly in urban areas, which raises very serious challenges.
It may inject real dynamism into society if it is based on genuine mutual tolerance.
But it may also be the source of confrontation and social division.
This mutual tolerance and respect will be one of the keys to social balance and cultural progress in our European societies.
I should like to thank the European Parliament for helping to enrich this debate, which I sincerely hope will be brought to a positive conclusion.
Through the impetus given by the Belgian Presidency and with the personal commitment of the Minister, Mr Duquesne - whom I should like to thank and whose efforts to reach compromises in a true European spirit I can vouch for - I hope that Laeken will constitute a major step towards establishing the area of freedom, security and justice.
This is not a dream; it is a reality which the public is increasingly keen to experience.
Mr President, as we all know, the last few weeks have been very difficult and we will continue to live in challenging times for many months and years ahead.
Therefore, this is a very important debate, and I am delighted that not just the Commissioner but the President-in-Office, Mr Duquesne, are here in person, recognising the importance of this issue.
As Mr Duquesne implied in his contribution, if the recent happenings have shown us anything, it is that we cannot turn a blind eye to events around the world and hope that they will go away.
The problems of people wanting asylum, the situation and the plight of the people of poor and troubled countries all over the world are our concerns and they manifest themselves on our doorsteps, on our shores and in our parliaments if we do not address them.
At one level these problems manifest themselves as debates in this and other parliamentary assemblies. At the worst level we find bodies in lorries at Dover, on the beaches of Spain and other countries.
This is the plight of desperate people seeking desperate measures to start a new life.
But these people are not resorting to this sort of action lightly; they are escaping from terror, war, torture, rape, vile regimes posing as governments and, of course, in some cases, poverty.
So there can be no more appropriate time for countries to be working together to confront these humanitarian challenges.
I congratulate the EU Heads of Government for having brought asylum into the Community competence and setting a progressive agenda at Tampere.
I congratulate the Commission on these proposals, which have started the debate on how a common asylum policy should be shaped.
In my report before Parliament today I am asking for a common and wider interpretation of the Geneva Convention of 1951, a clearer definition of who should be recognised as a refugee and one that is consistent across all 15 countries.
Let us also harmonise the treatment asylum seekers receive; let us establish Europe-wide common standards and then make sure that we enforce them.
If we adopt this report we can start to establish minimum basic rights, as the Minister and the Commissioner have said, for refugees, for access to welfare, housing, education, health care - things that we in the privileged world take for granted.
In recent years it sometimes seemed that EU countries were competing to become the least attractive to potential asylum seekers.
Common, Europe-wide standards will inevitably create a more balanced distribution of asylum claims throughout the EU.
That must help my city, London, and all the major cities of Europe.
It must also stop countries being able to lower their standards, which will be good for asylum seekers, who can be more confident of a fair hearing.
That is something of which we should be proud and not ashamed.
In addition and crucially, Europe must collectively do far more to address the root causes that lead to people seeking asylum and becoming refugees.
Governments must make concerted efforts to help create peace in the troubled parts of the world, however difficult, and to increase aid to developing countries - strong measures that in time will work towards countering the pressures that force people to migrate.
It is for the same reasons that we must press ahead with the enlargement of the European Union.
As Commissioner Verheugen said recently, we cannot ask ourselves the question: can we afford enlargement of the European Union?
Instead we should put the question: can we afford not to enlarge the European Union?
In committee, many centre-right and right-wing Members voted against my report in whole or in part.
I challenge those Members who are sitting opposite today, not to just give a prepared speech or ignore what I am saying now but to tell us why they are opposing certain parts of it and why they want to diminish the rights of a fair appeal, which is Amendments Nos 6 and 8 by Mr Schmitt.
How will this make the system better?
To those - perhaps the British Conservatives - who will vote against this report in its entirety, if they were here I would ask them to explain to Parliament how we can address the current asylum situation in Europe without Europe-wide policies.
They must recognise that this is a global issue and one that cannot be dealt with on an individual basis in each country.
I sympathise with Amendments Nos 11 and 12 by the Green Group, but I cannot support them.
We could support them in another report dealing with those escaping from hunger or environmental disasters.
However, this is a compassionate report, one with which we can be satisfied but not complacent.
In conclusion, I should like to thank my colleagues from my own and other groups for their help and support for this report and for their cooperation.
I thank my own group staff for their hard work and I pay tribute to the NGOs that have contributed valuable ideas.
I commend the report to Parliament.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to start with I would like to say, Mr Duquesne, that I regard it as very positive that you are taking part in this debate yourself as the Minister for the Interior and are not being represented by your Minister for European Affairs.
We have noted that you have a good grasp of the issue and are interested in really achieving something here.
If this can be done in conjunction with the Commission and Parliament, then we can look forward to some real progress.
The European Union is now clearly taking things seriously and is for the first time making a genuine attempt at a systematic approach toward migration policy. We have accordingly clearly established that there are three groups of migrants requiring different measures and different legal arrangements, and that there are also issues which cut across the three groups.
Let us look at the three groups first.
We have economic migrants, and my report addresses how they are received in the individual Member States, depending on the facilities and needs of those Member States.
Then we have asylum-seekers, who are recognised as refugees under the Geneva Convention.
I firmly believe that the Geneva Convention should on no account be watered down or departed from, either by extending or by diluting the grounds for granting refugee status.
What we need are swift and safe decisions for refugees and European minimum standards for the procedures involved.
The third group covers war refugees, that is refugees who come to us temporarily and need a different kind of help again.
Issues which cut across the three groups include family reunification and combating trafficking in and smuggling of human beings and illegal immigration.
That means that we have a complicated system before us.
My report is concerned exclusively with immigration on economic grounds and was adopted with six votes against, so that it achieved a fairly broad consensus.
I would like to express my sincere thanks for the extremely constructive and positive cooperation between the wide variety of political groups in this House, which made it possible to create a broad basis for a new approach to immigration into the European Union on economic grounds.
What is at stake here is controlling the immigration of workers and maintaining social, economic and political stability in the European Union.
However, in view of the events of 11 September, we also need increased vigilance when it comes to the hospitality, aid and freedoms offered by the Union, to make sure that these are not abused by individual elements to breach the security of Europe's citizens or of the world as a whole.
It should also be clear to us, as I stated at the beginning of my report, that we cannot counter demographic trends by means of immigration alone, but that the only really good and meaningful approach is, of course, an enhanced education policy and family policy.
It must also be clear that we have to give the integration of third country nationals living here legally higher priority than new immigration.
What are the core issues in my report?
It is evident that when it comes to immigration the European Union can only take on certain tasks and that a great deal must remain a matter for the Member States.
Another issue that must remain in the hands of the Member States is what workers and how many workers should be given residence permits and work permits for a particular Member State, depending on that State's needs and facilities.
It is also evident that if integration is to be successful, factors such as the availability of suitable work and housing must be taken into account.
Another important issue for the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is what we expect of immigrants, by which I mean their willingness to integrate and to recognise the Community of values.
Conversely, there should also be an obligation on the Member States to provide an appropriate level of support for integration.
At EU level it is a question of determining conditions for the entry and residence of these migrants and drawing up a coherent system for granting visas, of regulating the ability of third country nationals to move between Member States and the introduction of measures to counter trafficking in and smuggling of human beings and illegal immigration, and also cooperation and information campaigns in and with the countries of origin.
The committee in principle welcomes all the Commission's proposals on the immigration of workers.
I hope that the broad consensus that we achieved in committee will be repeated when we vote here in the plenary.
.
(NL) Mr President, when the report by Mr Evans was being written, we were still oblivious to the tragedy of 11 September.
In the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights and Defence Policy to this report, however, a number of recommendations were made which, precisely against the backdrop of 11 September, are very pertinent indeed.
This Parliament has often called for a common and unambiguous policy on evaluating whether or not countries are safe.
It is not acceptable that some Member States should declare countries safe, therefore refuse to receive refugees and asylum seekers, while other countries do.
The security services and embassies of our Member States should join forces in this respect.
Since 1992, there has been a structure in place, comprising CIREA and the High Level Working Group, but they do not operate well together.
And they certainly do not work well with the Member States.
We are therefore asking for an improved and transparent structure to be introduced in this field.
In addition, in a Union with open borders, discrepancies in admissions policy are untenable, and a joint foreign policy is also totally inappropriate if we fail to sing from the same hymn sheet.
In that sense, I would make an urgent appeal to the Commission to do something about this.
Afghanistan is, in fact, a good illustration of how things can work.
A second observation pertains to the aid to those countries that receive large groups of refugees.
We should provide far more aid to those countries, and especially the UNHCR.
In principle, it is better for people who flee to remain in the vicinity of their own country, so that they can return quickly.
But they do need support.
However, the UNHCR resources have been cut back drastically by the European Commission, and we believe that this situation should be improved promptly.
Moreover, we also believe that people should receive more education in the camps so that they do not fall victim to radicalism and crime.
Finally, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would like to point at the need to be a lot more pro-active in terms of conflict prevention.
It would be of great benefit to us if we could close the ranks better in the EU in this respect.
In that way, conflict could be prevented.
The recommendations made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy have been adopted unanimously in the committee.
It would be unfortunate, in my opinion, if Mr Evans' report would lead to diversity.
I would like to dare him to work closely with the other groups in order to reach unanimity.
We would then, at least, be able to support his report.
Mr President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy welcomes the Commission' s communication on Community immigration policy and unanimously saw fit to recommend the inclusion of a set of measures based on five premises:
One, to take on Europe' s shared historic responsibility for this problem.
Two, to consider immigration as a positive and irreversible phenomenon.
Three, to consider the harmony that should exist between the free movement of capital and goods on the one hand, and the free movement of persons on the other.
Four, the application of the whole range of human rights in political, social, economic and cultural terms to all people, including, of course, immigrants.
Five, to take advantage of the opportunity for the European Union to play a positive role in eliminating international inequalities, strengthening the economic links of countries in which immigration originates.
From this, again briefly, the Committee drew five main conclusions:
One, to have an EU immigration policy based upon human rights and mutual benefit with countries from which migratory flows originate.
Two, to promote multiculturalism, respect and positive regard for the contribution immigrants bring to our society and economic development.
Three, to speed up the legalisation of all immigrants and in this way fight against the mafias involved in the illegal trafficking of people.
Four, to have a coordinated common European foreign policy that serves as an instrument for eliminating poverty in countries in which immigration originates.
Consequently, five, to increase the B7-667 budget line and its effectiveness with the aim of limiting illegal immigration and strengthening democracy and the rule of law, in addition to launching integrated development aid programmes.
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
(ES) Mr President, I think the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission have given us two very good speeches.
The President-in-Office of the Council told us in all honesty that Council is at present rather confused about asylum and immigration policies.
Commissioner Vitorino, who has undertaken magnificent work in this field, told us that, in the area of immigration and asylum, Community institutions currently find themselves caught between two stools: that is to say between the first and the third pillars.
That is to say that immigration and asylum policies, at this moment in time, appear on the one hand in the Treaty establishing the European Community and yet there is no clear Community competence in the field of asylum and immigration.
Also, it is very strange that the Heads of State and Government in Tampere made grandiose statements about a European immigration policy, but we do not know if these will actually be converted into Community Law.
We, in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, have highlighted the inconsistencies between the declarations by the Heads of State and Government in Tampere and the commitments given in the Community Treaties.
I think that the Conference on immigration, which the President-in-Office of the Council informed us would take place within the next two weeks and at which I think there will be significant participation by Members of the European Parliament, will be an opportunity for the three Community institutions - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - to formulate, or to at least start to formulate, the need to give a Community legal basis to the problem of immigration, for, in this case, we have a genuine Community-wide problem.
With regard to immigration we cannot talk of subsidiarity.
The problem of immigration is, at this moment, common to all European countries, and Commissioner Vitorino, in carrying out the work on the Commission communication on a Community immigration policy, is moving in the right direction.
I think that the Commission' s strategy is suitable, but we need to strengthen it from the constitutional angle with the appropriate modification of the Community Treaties.
Mr President, as the Vienna Monitoring Centre showed last year, there is a need for a progressive policy and leadership in both areas under debate today.
I welcome the recognition that a restrictive approach to immigration has not worked and is counter-productive.
We have only to look at the increase in trafficking and the difficulty in recruiting skilled professionals to demonstrate this.
It is obvious that there is work available in the European Union for people from third countries.
In many of our countries they are crucial to agricultural production and many major companies employ third-country nationals in senior executive posts.
Yet there is still an attitude around that we are doing such people a favour by allowing them to enter the EU to support our economy and our social security system.
Let us be honest: we want them to help maintain our standard of living.
If we get it right, it should be a mutual benefit.
As part of that, we need to ensure equal treatment for third-country nationals, not least in the workplace.
The implementation of the Article 13 directives on anti-discrimination is also crucial.
Why work here, if you then face racism and xenophobia?
Business tells us that recruitment needs to be made easier and more flexible at all skill levels.
This calls into question work permits attached to a particular job and company.
Unfortunately, the lead committee did not take this on board.
Recruitment is also hampered by restrictions on family reunion, business tells us.
My political group has tabled amendments relating to that human factor.
The working rights of partners also need to be improved.
We have also to recognise the fact that some migrants will wish to stay and settle.
This is important in terms of continuity and stability for individuals, society and business.
A constant turnover is problematic on many levels and we have to remember that we are human beings, not cogs in an economic wheel.
Mr President, immigration over recent decades, which is measurable in millions, has taken place largely despite the arrangements put in place by the Member States.
In most cases, the hallmark of national policies on immigration is a lack of vision and creativity and a fear of domination by foreign influences.
However, there is now no disputing that immigration has taken place on a substantial scale and that immigration will and must take place in future.
The detailed reasons for this are to be found in the 28 pages of the Commission communication.
The Commission's shift to an active immigration policy is very much to be welcomed.
The Commission recognises that pressures to migrate will continue and that regulated immigration can be advantageous for the EU, for the immigrants themselves and for their countries of origin.
This change in policy does, however, also mean that decisions will have to be taken and that it is not sufficient merely to administer immigration by hiding behind general political guidelines, or, in the words of the rapporteur, on the basis of the cornerstones of immigration policy.
That would mean that we would never achieve a Community migration policy as laid down in the Tampere conclusions. Instead, immigration would remain a national responsibility for Member States, with all their shortcomings, with just a basic framework at Community level.
Overall, a long-term immigration policy can reduce the pressure from illegal immigration, from trafficking in human beings, from illegal employment and from the economic exploitation of migrants.
Third country nationals must be given the same rights as EU citizens, as the Commission assumes in its communication, and they should be able to contribute to the local economy through their work; only in this way will the sort of integration we want take place.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission communication on a Community immigration policy with common standards and a common status for recognised asylum-seekers has provoked a much-needed debate and you deliberately arranged for an open debate at the outset, Commissioner Vitorino.
Various possible scenarios have been presented and the possibilities for a common procedure and common principles have been investigated.
I deeply regret that in contrast to the Pirker report it was not possible to achieve a broad compromise in committee.
Unfortunately, in the case of the Evans report, instead of a reasonable consensus emerging, it was ideology that won the day.
It is intended that both the grounds on which asylum is granted and the procedures involved should be extended across Europe. This is despite the fact, as you mentioned, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that at present some 90% of asylum-seekers apply for asylum on purely economic grounds and are therefore rejected, and despite the fact that the present checking procedures can take up to eight years.
I am sure that it is only possible to agree to extensions of this kind if you have totally lost sight of the position in your own country.
What will the impact on us be if arrangements of the kind Mr Evans is presenting to us today become a reality, and if in future persecution by non-State agents and gender-related persecution are recognised?
In practice this would amount to granting an unlimited right of residence in the EU to most families in the Islamic world.
Why is that?
Let me explain.
No one would deny that in every Islamic country there are fundamentalist groups that use Islam to discriminate against women's rights, from the perspective of our system of values.
Which means that any woman in an Islamic State can make a valid claim of persecution by non-State groups.
If this were to be recognised in the EU, she would then be able to bring her entire family to join her.
So the question we need to ask here is this: do we want to and are we able here in Europe to solve the problems of the Islamic world and the problems of the Islamic view of women?
I have a clear answer to that: no!
And the picture is even clearer now that we are all aware of the problems and risks that have arisen over the last few weeks.
At the same time, Mr Evans, contrary to his original statement, wishes to abolish the concept of a safe third country and thus burden the in any case protracted procedures with additional checks.
My own conclusion is therefore that in its present form the Evans report is irresponsible.
It gives the Member States sufficient arguments for refusing to give us the right of codecision when further EU reforms in this area are being considered.
It is evident that there is a majority in this House that is not yet mature enough to be given such responsibility.
Mr Evans, if you are advocating an extension of the right of asylum here, then I would ask you what steps your own party, the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, has taken in this direction in recent years?
I can tell you that it has certainly not dealt with things in this way.
That is because it does not have the support of a majority of the population for such steps and Labour could otherwise expect to be voted out.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to be quite explicit about this, and it is obvious in any case: if we try to standardise every detail of the right of asylum across Europe in future, we will be unable to achieve agreement on this in the Council of Ministers.
That is why I am specifically asking you and advising you to limit harmonisation to the necessary minimum standards.
Mr President, Europe is experiencing tension between low population growth and a genuine demand for manpower in the labour market, on the one hand, and a population that is distrustful of immigration on the other.
Faced with this situation, political decision-makers can react in two ways: either by exploiting people' s fears to their own advantage, at least in the short term, or by attempting to manage the different aspects of immigration as best they can, bravely explaining the reasons for this phenomenon, the benefits it brings our societies, its more problematic aspects and the policies that are necessary.
We have seen some examples of this first approach right here this very morning.
In its two communications, the Commission has, fortunately, positioned itself firmly in the second camp, and we can only congratulate the Commissioner for this and show our approval.
It has also achieved this - I would like to stress - in accordance with the agreements and mandates reached at the European Council in Tampere.
Whilst I fully subscribe to everything my friend and colleague, Mr Evans, said about asylum, I would like to focus during the short speaking time available to me on the communication on immigration and the report.
Both define a clear path to be followed.
The communication discusses, and the report also focuses on, the external and internal causes of immigration, the need for codevelopment policies and a new partnership with the countries of origin, a common European legislative framework to organise entry in a fair, transparent and straightforward way, residency and integration, which to me means rights.
Only after this does it talk, once these standards have been established, of addressing the subject of illegal immigration, because we need legal channels to do this.
Lastly, the report speaks, and we shall be discussing this here in detail when we see the legislative proposals, of establishing new immigration policies in the twenty-first century for a new society and a new economy, that cannot simply be a rehash of guest worker policies from the industrial societies of the 1960s.
I hope that the Council will also align itself with those politicians who want to broach this subject clearly and courageously.
I really hope this will be the case and I say this in the full knowledge that, on the subject of immigration, we are speaking with both our minds and our hearts - I say this knowing that listening to me today are EU citizens, some by birth and others through choice, all invited by my colleague Mr Aparicio, and who have high expectations of this debate.
Parliament will try to prove equal to events, and, despite the fact that on occasions events make things difficult for us, we are going to try, and this is something that has never been done by the PPE-DE Group with regard to asylum, to give strong support to this Commission communication and we hope in exchange, Mr President, that the European Council at Laeken will be able to once again initiate a dynamic and robust policy that will allow us to tackle this much needed common immigration policy.
Mr President, my group strongly supports the report by Mr Evans and welcomes its call for a high-quality common asylum policy.
It is a curious feature of the construction of Europe that more opportunities for cross-border cooperation have been taken by commerce and criminals than by civil servants, and it is about time our national public administrations made a real effort to get out of their bunkers.
The situation at Sangatte, near Calais, has featured often on television screens in my home country in recent months.
The UK can reflect on why so many people wish to come to our country and especially to my city, London.
I like to think, at least in part, that this is a compliment to our free and diverse society, but we cannot just have an open door, and maybe the French authorities need to reflect on whether their system could be improved.
There must be an equal balance of effort and sharing of responsibility to prevent both forum shopping by asylum seekers and 'pass the parcel' by Member States.
We also need consistency.
It is illogical to be dismissive about people fleeing Iraq or Afghanistan, implying that they are undeserving scroungers, when by common agreement the regimes of those countries are deemed brutal and depressive, and even deserving of military attack.
Even if not everyone from such countries can be judged refugees under the strict Geneva Convention criteria, but only as escaping mere misery, there is no call to demonise them.
We must also be consistent about our attitude to women.
If we think, as we do, that women's human rights in Afghanistan are grossly denied, we must take account of that in deciding asylum claims.
Finally, we must not weaken or lower the standards of our asylum systems under the guise of fighting terrorism, as the British Home Secretary is threatening to do.
There are adequate powers to detain and deport if security is threatened.
Speedy decisions are those based on high-quality procedures and efficiency such as that offered by the functioning immigration service computers which the UK lacks - not on removing appeal rights for all applicants.
Mr President, when a Community competence in immigration and asylum was enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam it certainly raised hopes, chief among them that of seeing a policy on immigration and asylum founded on values associated with democratic freedoms and respect for human rights, especially fundamental rights.
In this respect, we welcome the two Commission communications, which examine these complex issues in great depth.
Thus, instead of ineffective, inappropriate immigration policies which make illegal immigration an inherent part of the system, they propose a flexible approach with provisions for managing flows and integrating third-country nationals.
It is regrettable that our rapporteur on immigration should have focused on exploiting the management of migratory flows for the economic and demographic ends of the countries in the Union, without showing concern for the human factor.
To implement these proposals on an intergovernmental basis, as Mr Pirker wishes, would not only be a step backwards compared with the Treaty of Amsterdam; it would also show contempt for the need to make immigration and asylum policy a Community instrument and above all it would be a refusal to recognise what is really happening on the ground, which can be seen every day at Sangatte and elsewhere.
Furthermore, we urgently need to correct the misconception that, 'immigration equals workers' .
The notion of a 'migrant worker' does not actually take account of what really happens when people immigrate with members of their family, including students or retired people.
Let us remember that the right to live as part of a family is a fundamental right which no country can deny.
There is therefore a strong case in favour of talking about 'residents' and - why not - 'European citizens' , assuming that they participate fully.
It is the Member States' duty to take the necessary measures to ensure that all European residents are fully integrated; they achieve this by making sure that everyone has the same rights, including political ones.
As far as illegal immigrants are concerned, the only solution that we know of is for the Member States to be responsible for legalising their situation so as to combat all forms of crime, including that committed by traffickers and unscrupulous employers.
Mr President, while stating that our Group is fully in agreement with the Evans report, I should, however, like to highlight two aspects. First, the procedure for examining refugee applications needs to be speeded up.
Member States should be aware that many of their problems, but especially many of the immigrant refugees' problems, would be overcome if these applications were dealt with quickly.
A great many refugees - a great many people who have every right to be recognised as such - wait for months or years without receiving aid, deprived of work, gradually sliding towards illegality and often sucked into areas of organised and other crime.
It is therefore necessary to shorten these excessively long time periods.
Secondly, it is important to understand and establish the fact that the notion of a 'safe country' is one that may be overturned by specific evidence of the treatment an individual receives in his or her country.
I mean that the notion of a safe country must be a relative assumption, because many refugees flee from a safe country because they are personally persecuted.
This notion must not, therefore, be an absolute notion, but the conditions to which the individual refugees have been subjected - in other words, the conditions that have led them to flee to another country - should be examined on a case-by-case basis, and they may lead to the above-mentioned notion of a safe third country being overturned.
Mr President, I should particularly like to thank Mr Pirker for the work he has done.
Now more than ever, as the rapporteur has stressed, it is essential to reformulate Community immigration policy: not just aseptic rules allowing or forbidding entry, but a broader and more responsible approach based above all on economic and demographic assessments and evaluations of social and cultural integration.
We therefore need to lay down a strategy for a sustainable immigration policy in which national and local institutions can play a major part in using objective criteria to identify occupational needs and the availability of jobs, accommodation, social services and training for all those who ask to come and live and work in our Member States.
Setting limits and strict rules means ensuring they get the best possible welcome and are fully integrated, with mutual respect and benefits for both European citizens and the immigrants. It means avoiding painful social conflict, and it also means being tough on illegal immigration, which all too often is associated with crime and exploitation.
Above all, Europe cannot confine itself to taking a passive role and attitude towards immigration as if it were just a traffic policeman directing traffic.
Europe must act with greater political awareness so that it can also interpret fully the strong motivations underlying these phenomena.
Very often, or almost always, people from third countries come to Europe out of desperation, poverty, hunger or marginalisation.
Their desperation is such that there are mothers who leave their own children and come to our countries in order to earn something for them.
For this very reason, and also because of its geographical situation, Europe cannot play a merely bureaucratic role, encouraging or limiting immigration.
Europe must choose to play a strong, responsible, political role, aware that behind the policy choices to be made regarding immigration there lies the possibility of also being a player in the serious international crisis we are going through.
We must be aware that it is only by making greater efforts through Third World development programmes and by preventing the so-called brain drain that we can implement the best peace policy of all, which is the fight against poverty and injustice.
In conclusion, Mr President, we must be aware that well regulated immigration can bring great benefits to the European Union, to the immigrants themselves and to their countries of origin.
But we must be wary of the demagogy of those who propose too permissive an immigration policy, a policy that would encourage Europe to open its borders indiscriminately, reduce controls and extend the right to asylum to an absurd degree, but then to selfishly close our eyes - as we have been doing for years - towards what is happening in the Middle East and the southern countries, as if it had nothing at all to do with us.
September 11 showed that what happens in those parts of the world affects us closely, and so we should really be convinced, with a little consistency...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, seeing as there is no rule guaranteeing to the inhabitants of one country the right to enter another if the second country is opposed to this, I would like to voice some considerations and one deep concern on the subject of immigration. This concern springs from having seen communities, and individuals belonging to communities of immigrants, celebrating after the tragic attacks in the United States, and from the knowledge that terrorist cells have been sheltered and supported by certain communities on ethnic and religious grounds.
At this point, with the greatest respect for the majority of immigrants who are respectable and honest, I feel that it would be appropriate, in future, to adopt more stringent criteria when assessing immigrants, based on the precautionary principle, in order to avoid even just the potential risks which some immigrants could introduce into our Europe.
With regard to Europe, in Italy, we are preparing a fairer, more severe, more appropriate law on immigration.
We need to prevent European legislation conflicting with our national laws because we do not want left-wing permissiveness, which was rejected by the Italian electorate, to penetrate our legislation via Brussels.
In Denmark, it has recently become public knowledge that Danish authorities have provided residence permits to outright war criminals, in particular the General responsible for the massacres of the Kurds under Saddam Hussein in 1988.
This is, of course, scandalous, as the Danish right wing also acknowledges, but ought not the right wing to be content with the fact that the Danish NATO government has obtained military and political benefits from giving shelter to a war criminal?
Ought not Saddam' s General to have earned his fare home long ago?
Naturally, he has been debriefed by the CIA. That goes without saying.
Very discreetly, of course, just as more and more crucial aspects of political life take place in ever more hermetically sealed rooms.
This baroque situation reflects one of the ambivalent features of Mr Evans' s report, which is otherwise full of engaging features.
The report endorses and further develops the finest legal principles we know.
The Evans report centres upon persecuted human beings in a way that Mr Pirker' s, which is of course an expression of undisguised worker imperialism, does not.
This is appealing and necessary.
The problem is that these sound principles are part of political and legal contexts which will in practice reduce them to ideological window dressing.
The common asylum and immigration policy is being used first and foremost as an engine for homogenising countries' extremely different legal traditions by creating an area of freedom, security and justice that is the crucial link in the European superstate.
The loser in this disagreeable game is democracy, and the benefit for refugees is doubtful unless one is a general in Saddam Hussein' s army.
Mr President, the Commission communication on a Community immigration policy is extremely disappointing.
I am talking about the written communication, because both the oral statement which Commissioner Vitorino has just made and that given by the Council were very interesting and much more balanced than what we are accustomed to hearing in this House, and they give us hope that there will be a change in policy following the attacks of 11 September.
The written communication in any case is marked by a certain lack of a sense of what is really happening on the ground, the same shortcoming which is responsible for discussions in the Council on the proposals on family reunification being at a standstill today, a fate which may well be reserved in the future for the proposals on asylum which I have criticised, in particular during our last part-session.
The written communication focuses on legal immigration, but - apart from a few allusions - it minimises or forgets illegal immigration and the essential fact that today one in every two people emigrating to the industrialised world does so illegally.
Of course, I am aware that papers have already been tabled on illegal immigration, in particular on trafficking in human beings and on the liability of hauliers, but these are specific texts, tabled, moreover, for the most part by Member States by virtue of their right of initiative, which they still have for the time being.
These texts do not show any evidence of an overall grasp of the problem; they are not equal to the challenge.
The Commission has just announced that it is going to table further papers following the attacks of 11 September.
So much the better.
In the meantime, however, if anyone wants to read a good document which clearly sets out the real problems associated with immigration and their possible solutions, they have to refer not to the Commission communication which is being examined today, but to the strategy paper on asylum and immigration, the amended version of which was tabled by the Austrian Presidency on 19 November 1998 - yes, I did say 1998.
I would invite listeners of good faith to compare the two texts; they will be staggered by the differences in approach.
For example, reading from the Austrian document: Generally speaking, it is no longer only issues related to asylum and the problems of temporary protection but also, and especially, general migration issues, the problems posed by the fight against illegal immigration networks and issues related to expulsion which are at the heart of the political debate.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I ought to read it to you in full, but time does not allow and this sentence on its own shows what the real priorities are.
(Applause from the right)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, taking as a starting point the reports by my esteemed fellow Members Mr Evans and Mr Pirker, I would like to talk about the communication from Commissioner Vitorino which is at the heart of this. He is a colleague whom we hold in extraordinarily high regard on the basis of our joint work in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and whose opinion I have very little in common with!
A fundamental debate is taking place about asylum and immigration in Europe.
It is about guidelines for asylum and immigration in Europe.
We need to be clear about two things: first about the quotas to be applied and secondly about the content.
As far as the methodology is concerned, European directives on asylum and immigration can only set minimum standards.
It is only possible to oblige the European Union as a whole to accept minimum standards.
Anything going beyond that will not be accepted.
One example of this is that Commissioner Vitorino's proposals on family reunification may suit some people, but it is not possible to stipulate a binding solution for the entire Union.
Some revision is needed here.
As regards content, we need to limit and control immigration.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned the concept of 'fortress Europe' .
It is precisely because we do not want to erect a fortress Europe and could not do so anyway that we must control and limit immigration.
The approach proposed by Commissioner Vitorino does not meet these requirements.
A couple more examples: by adopting the concept of the safe third country, we in Germany have been able to reduce the number of asylum-seekers from some 450 000 to well under 100 000.
Commissioner Vitorino has virtually given up this concept, by making its use dependent on conditions which make it almost impossible to apply in practice.
My second point is that binding material grounds for granting asylum are laid down in the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.
It would be giving asylum-seekers an incentive if we go beyond the binding framework of the Geneva Convention, as in the case of persecution by non-State agents for example.
There are some very worthy individual arguments in favour of this, but we cannot allow a higher level of asylum than at present.
The problem of asylum is with the procedure.
It is still a fact that 90% of all asylum-seekers in Europe are not victims of political persecution.
So we need to get the procedure under control.
If we can manage to bring the procedure to a rapid conclusion, we can be more generous when it comes to grounds for the granting of asylum.
However, this does not sit well with the three-stage asylum procedure that Commissioner Vitorino is proposing, for example.
Commissioner Vitorino, if Mr Schily, the German Minister for the Interior, who as you know does not belong to the same party as I do, behaves in the same way in Council as he does in Germany then your proposals have no hope at all!
Mr President, notwithstanding the events of 11 September, the Commission communication on asylum basically remains not only appropriate but more necessary than ever.
The Evans report, for its part, is no less topical or relevant.
This is not the time to step back and it is, therefore, crucial to work towards a solution common to all the Member States with regard to the criteria for assessing requests and to cooperation between national administrative systems.
I can see that we will have to confront certain challenges in order to come up with effective regulations.
This effort must not only involve the European dimension, however, but also cooperation with third countries, specifically with the asylum seekers' countries of origin.
In order to avoid the 'Kafakaesque' situations often described in the European press, it is crucial that we adopt - and we are not asking for much - minimum standards that will ensure faster and simpler procedures for granting asylum so as to prevent the demoralisation and uncertainty that beset asylum seekers.
The creation of a space of freedom, security and justice will inevitably involve the need for the mutual recognition of judgments.
In order to reach this stage, however, we must first of all harmonise asylum procedures.
Mr President, this communication, for which Commissioner António Vitorino is responsible, is making a timely appearance on the agenda.
On the basis of the framework defined in Tampere, we are committed to create a common policy in the field of asylum, which I am sure will have the support of the Council and of Parliament.
Through a joint effort by the Community institutions and civil society we will achieve a platform of understanding, so that by 1 May 2004 the objective outlined by the European Council will be complied with.
Mr President, we have a historical responsibility to take this decision and there is no time for hesitation.
I wish you the best of luck, Commissioner.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino on the immigration policy that the European Commission has presented to this Parliament.
The proposal to agree common admission conditions for migrants and to set up, in addition and alongside this, a policy instrument whereby Member States indicate target figures for work migration, receives the support of the ELDR Group.
My group would like to make a few observations with regard to the proposed system.
Firstly, we reject the policy of zero immigration, but we also reject the policy of completely open borders.
A responsible compromise must be struck.
Secondly, the immigration system must be flexible.
Quotas should not be forced upon the Member States from above.
Thirdly, we must take account of subsidiarity, that is to say regional and national differences with regard to the labour market.
Fourthly, a common immigration policy must also be accompanied by a common fight against illegal immigration.
Fifthly, we must strike the right balance between the need for work forces in industry on the one hand and the unemployed within the European Union on the other.
In summary, the ELDR Group calls for a balanced European immigration policy.
The Pirker report, for which I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, is on the same wavelength.
Mr President, these will be my last words in this House since I have now been appointed member of the Council of State in the Netherlands.
I would like to thank the fellow MEPs for their kind cooperation and wish them all every success.
The European Parliament is a very important institution, which I will always continue to support.
Mr Wiebenga, we wish you all the best, and I am sure that the State will be in good hands if you are a member of the Council of State!

Ladies and gentlemen, I must ask you to stick strictly to your speaking time, as we are dreadfully behind schedule!
Mr President, I should first like to pay tribute to Commissioner Vitorino, because I believe that it is thanks to his tireless work that today we are able to draw a clear distinction between asylum-seekers and immigration, and this is to be welcomed.
I would also thank the representative of the Belgian Presidency, who has just definitively abandoned the idea of a fortress Europe, which it is neither feasible nor desirable to achieve.
Finally, I should like to thank our colleague, Mr Evans, for his painstaking work.
I believe that it is by applying clear, fair and precise standards that we will not only ensure that refugees are protected but also fight to release them from the grasp of criminal organisations.
In my opinion, Mr Evans's painstaking work is in stark contrast to the partisan vision presented by Mr Pirker.
Mr Pirker poses some complex questions, but the answers are inadequate and even dangerous.
This internal report by Mr Pirker, comprising reflection, analysis and proposals, is one of the weakest which we have had to discuss in this Parliament.
Firstly, it contains a series of commonplaces.
After a time, it says, immigrants adopt the birth-rate pattern of the host country.
As I see it, this is a sign of integration and proof that attitudes change.
Instead of being delighted about this, however, Mr Pirker expresses concern about the fact that the destiny of women from the third world, female immigrants who have come from the South, is not confined to having children.
He also recommends a policy to recruit a set number of workers which, he says, is supported by the Member States as a way of reducing the labour shortage in certain sectors.
For him, immigrants are like Kleenex: you use them and when you no longer need them you throw them away.
This is a vision of the human being, more particularly black and African, or dark-skinned, human beings who come from the South, which I do not share.
Mr Pirker's report deplores family reunification.
Mr Pirker's report does, I believe, in many respects, stand in total contradiction to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice.
Faced with an issue of this complexity, instead of saying that the tragedy in Dover opened our eyes to the possible consequences of immigration, we would have preferred him to consider taking measures against the hauliers who are the real proponents of modern slavery and against the slum landlords ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the dramatic events in New York have, it seems to me, made us free to discuss certain subjects which have, until now, been taboo.
Those who claimed to forbid any value judgments on civilisations are suddenly waging war on Islam.
Others, who rejected any criticism of immigration, are suddenly seeing a potential terrorist in every foreigner.
I can tell you straight away that this is not the position of the group of right-wing Europeans.
Immigration is a phenomenon on a scale such that it cannot be seen on the same level as acts of terrorism, on which immigrants do not in any case have a monopoly.
It is not the immigrants who are guilty, it is those who bring them here for economic reasons, and it may perhaps surprise you to learn that, on this point, I agree in part with what our colleague, Mr Sylla, has just said.
It is also those who let themselves sink into a policy of fait accompli, and Mr Pirker' s recitals - I am thinking of recitals M and N - alas give us an example of this, alongside making some positive points.
I note in particular, for example, that Paragraph 13 of the report, "takes the view that the various historical, economic and social features in the individual Member States make it impossible to lay down a uniform requirement in labour from third countries which would cover the entire territory of the Union and that, furthermore, the Union has no powers in law in this field."
So, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why are conclusions not drawn from this Paragraph 13?
And why not restore sovereignty to the Member States in this regard and with it the legitimate right to protect our borders?
After all, the dramatic events which we have witnessed have quite clearly shown that protecting borders was key to security, because this is what the government of the United States immediately did when it found itself in an emergency situation.
Finally, I will close by saying that immigration should not be seen as a solution to the falling population which we are seeing in Europe.
If the people of Europe abandon to others their duty to give life to new generations, they also abandon their right to live as free nations on the territory of their ancestors.
We do not accept this.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, I would like to do something that I rarely do for reasons of time, and congratulate Mr Pirker on his well balanced report, although I believe that he is at present not in the Chamber.
Social integration of economic migrants in the Member States is, as he stressed, absolutely essential if we are to avoid social tensions.
And a greater degree of contact between immigrants and the indigenous population will perhaps also help us to recognise 'sleepers' and so help to fight terrorism.
I also believe that in view of all the measures proposed it is important to give the Member States the option of fine-tuning the entry and residence of third country nationals in accordance with the requirements of their own labour markets and demographic trends, because these questions in particular can only be dealt with at local level.
It will also be important to take into account the imminent enlargement of the EU when planning immigration policy.
The rapporteur took all this into consideration.
I wish his report every success, and we will certainly be supporting it.
Mr President, for the first time ever in this Parliament we are talking about economic migration and asylum in distinct and separate terms, which could be considered to be a wise move by the European Commission in its respective communications for it will help us to give the debate a sense of order and clarity.
This was one of Parliament' s requests that has now become reality.
I would like to briefly share two thoughts with you on the issues that are the subject of this debate: firstly, that the migratory movements toward Europe we are now seeing correspond to a mass exodus of citizens who, in their own countries, do not enjoy the minimum conditions necessary for survival and who are being tragically exploited by the organised mafias who traffic in them.
This has already been discussed here in Parliament.
The cases in Dover and on our own Andalusian coast are clear examples of this.
However, illegal immigration of this nature is fertile ground for the social exclusion of this immigrant population and for the exploitation of their labour, in addition to the outbreaks of xenophobia and racism that are taking place in certain parts of Europe.
This problem can only be resolved by close cooperation and collaboration with the countries of origin, otherwise, any policy in this field will be condemned to failure.
Community programmes such as PHARE, TACIS, MEDA, or the immigration and asylum action plans themselves are absolutely necessary.
Yet at the same time, and I would like to put particular emphasis on this point, it must also be stressed, from a political angle in particular, that the countries of origin should make the most of their natural and human resources and, most of all, guarantee political and social stability so that their citizens can have confidence in their own leaders.
This is, therefore, an issue of shared responsibility and not only the responsibility of the Member States or of the European Union itself.
Countries such as Morocco, Algeria or Tunisia are an example of what I have just been referring to.
On the other hand, with regard to the communication on the common asylum procedure, the main problem with which Member States are confronted is that of asylum seekers whose claims are unfounded. The Commission and this Parliament should, therefore, make a great effort to remove the major obstacles blocking the standardisation of solutions between Member States.
On this subject, it does not seem to be the right occasion to talk about a common procedure, distinct from the mandate contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam that refers to a common asylum procedure.
It is not the same.
Furthermore, both the communication and the Evans report fail to define concepts such as persecution by third parties, persecution in cases of conflict or gender related persecution, for example, given that the difficulty sometimes lies more in the definition of the concept of the refugee than in the process of identifying it.
To be precise, we are on the right track: faced with a phenomenon such as asylum and immigration, a concern for many of us, cooperation, solidarity, clear legislation and realism are the necessary prerequisites for addressing one of the major challenges for the European Union in this new century.
Mr President, at a time when we have all, I hope, been scandalised by Mr Berlusconi' s statements, demonstrating as they do such suspicion and hatred of foreigners, I believe that now, more than ever, it is time to combat racism, and to combat it in all its most insidious forms.
The Commission' s communication on a Community immigration policy, and the vote on the Pirker report, give us an opportunity to do just that.
In that respect I welcome Mr Vitorino's statements.
We must not forget that for Europeans the Tampere Summit in October 1999, which sought fair treatment for nationals of third countries in comparison with citizens of the Union, was a very important event.
We must start from one important established fact, which we were reminded of just now: the myth of zero immigration can no longer be a realistic concept, and in any case demographic problems and labour shortages will have to make us change our ideas about immigration.
This is why, today, we must give our strong support to the Commission' s communication, because this future Community policy on immigration has a great many virtues, in particular that of combating all forms of criminal activity.
It has to be said that the rapporteur, Mr Pirker, has adopted a rather critical position regarding the Commission' s communication.
Unlike Mr Pirker, we socialists are convinced that our approach to this question must be a humane approach rather than an economic approach, because we are talking here about the fate of human beings, not about common merchandise.
We must also remember, and we can never remember it enough, that if people emigrate and suffer the pain of separation from their country and their loved ones, it is because they are obliged to do so. They are not simply doing it for pleasure.
The Commission' s position is fundamental inasmuch as it proposes a framework.
I shall end by saying, in addition, that in a European Union which is constantly becoming more integrated, and which now has the benefit of a Charter of Fundamental Rights, no Member State can now claim that its policy on admission is nobody' s business but its own.
I therefore reiterate my full and wholehearted support for the Commission' s proposal, at the same time taking a critical view of the content of Mr Pirker' s report.
As far as I am concerned, I defer the vote of the French socialist delegation on this report.

Mr President, I wish to discuss Paragraph 15 of Mr Pirker' s report which says, among other things, that immigrants are expected to respect the community of values - as set out in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights - and to show a willingness to integrate.
How is this to be interpreted?
A wave of Islamophobia is passing over Europe at present. In several EU countries, Muslims have been persecuted.
The most rancorous debate I have been able to follow is taking place right now in Denmark. Quite a few politicians have made astounding statements.
Mr Camre, a Member of this House, has said that all the countries of the Western world are being infiltrated by Muslims and that, while some of them are friendly enough with us, many of them are in favour of getting rid of us - in Danish, få os fjernet - that is to say, removing us.
That is a prejudiced and irresponsible statement.
My concern, as I address this House, is that the wording of Paragraph 15 might be in danger of creating further scope for this type of inflammatory statement. Is Europe not in danger of losing its diversity?
Are we not in danger of tampering with freedom of religion and freedom of expression?
Could not Paragraph 15 be understood as saying, 'Adapt, full stop. Otherwise, gather your belongings together and go!'
I wonder if Mr Camre might respond to this.
Mr President, I want to begin by fully endorsing both Mr Olle Schmid' s description of the political situation in Denmark and the request with which he concluded.
I also want to say that I think there are an incredibly large number of good things in the Commission' s proposals in this area.
It would of course be marvellous if we were to use our cooperation to strengthen the principles we talk so much about - democracy and human rights and, I might add, humanitarianism - instead of dragging each other down to the lowest common denominator.
I think there are quite a lot of good things in Mr Evans' s report.
I intend to support it and shall call for a vote in favour of it.
I think, however, that there are still a lot of problems with Mr Pirker' s report.
It was improved quite considerably by the committee' s reading of it. It is also, of course, reasonable to hope that it will be further improved in the course of today when we vote on it.
However, a lot more is required before I shall support the report, which is based principally upon the EU' s wanting to show solidarity with itself.
Mr President, Mr Evans has put a great deal of thought into his report.
Quite rightly, he raises the issue of the safe-country concept being based on human rights considerations, not on diplomatic links.
He underlines the lack of common approach between the Member States with regard to the concept of safe countries.
This is no longer acceptable.
Mr Evans concludes that the concept of safe countries needs to be defined unequivocally.
Although I agree with his motivation, we must admit that this approach is not a safe one.
I recall that our colleague, Mr Pasqua, as France's French Minister of the Interior, once said that 'La démocratie s'arrête là où commence la raison d'Etat.'
Mr Evans: as long as la raison d'Etat exists, there is no safe country.
Mr President, I am really sorry about this, because the debate is an interesting one which I believe demonstrates not only the complexity of the issue, but also its political dimension.
It would be unreasonable to think that it is merely a question of settling technical problems in the context of a generalised consensus, and I believe that these difficulties also demonstrate the urgent need to reach a consensus, at European level, on a certain number of essential measures.
First of all I think that it would be unreasonable and irresponsible to deny the extent of clandestine immigration and the fact that it is getting worse.
I believe that that would be unreasonable and politically tactless.
It is therefore very important, in addition to having measures of a regulatory nature, to develop an active policy of combating trafficking in human beings, because such trafficking constitutes, above all, the exploitation of a great deal of misery, poverty and fear, by organisations which are highly efficient and who not only traffic in human beings but also engage in other criminal activities.
For this reason, policing measures, and in particular the intensifying of border checks, are essential if we are to remain one step ahead and ensure that our future external borders will be protected.
I would remind you that the largest police operation that has ever been undertaken in Europe is now underway, on our future external borders.
Thirty countries are involved, from Finland to the Mediterranean.
I am sure I do not need to tell the European Parliament that, to us, asylum is a sacred concept, that it constitutes the dignity of Europe, and that is why, throughout the world, Europe still acts as a beacon and an example.
We cannot preach in favour of democracy and liberty if we do not set an example ourselves.
However, at the same time we cannot ignore the fact that this important value is being abused by a considerable number of people, who probably have, in human terms, legitimate reasons for doing so, but who do it to the detriment of those who are fleeing real persecution.
It is therefore a matter of urgency that we should first of all agree on the conditions for receiving would-be refugees into our territory, and not add still further to the attractive prospect which our prosperous and - though we tend to forget it - happy countries pose to those who know only wretchedness and poverty.
We must therefore agree quickly on the rules for allowing people to come in, if we want to avoid the phenomenon of asylum shopping.

Asylum is, of course, a right, but is it necessary, in order to have legal guarantees, that things should be complicated, thereby allowing procedures to be dilatory and resulting in a situation in which, in some countries, even after four, five or six years no one has proved capable of taking a decision, so that it is necessary to take measures to regularise the situation?
Respect for the law is not incompatible with rapid and effective procedures.
These were the questions we raised at the last Council, and I was pleased to find that, among the Fifteen, there was a very broad consensus on the need to reach a consensus on this issue.
Finally, of course, we must define a certain number of rules at European level. I was going to say minimum rules, but I shall not do so because to some people that would mean 'no improvement' .
What I am trying to say is essential rules which do not necessarily go into matters in detail but which translate into practical terms the fundamental political consensus that there has to be on this subject if we are ever to succeed in overcoming this problem.
We need to do this quickly, and that is why I said that we must, at the Laeken Summit, try to re-launch the European dynamic, because otherwise the outcome would be negative and not a true reflection of our opinions.
We must also decide how much solidarity has to be agreed on at European level because the mere fact that one country happens to be situated at an external border should not mean that that country should necessarily have to bear the whole burden of any measures that are agreed on.
It is true that immigration is another problem, but it is also true that we cannot claim that if we had a more or less unrestricted immigration system all our problems would be solved; nowhere in the world is there any example of such a policy being implemented, and even where the system is the most liberal, it is still not possible to solve all the problems, especially those that are still linked to illegal immigration.
It is therefore necessary to ask a certain number of pertinent questions, and this is what we shall be doing at the conference which will be taking place in a few days' time in Brussels.
How is Europe' s population going to develop?
Do we still have any requirements at economic level and if so, of what kind?
Will the situation be the same everywhere? Does immigration have to be subject to conditions?
Is it to be permanent or for a limited period?
Should we demand a certain number of qualifications, risking savage consequences for the countries of origin, which often have a need for precisely those qualifications?
Would there not be the risk of an increase in the number of unemployed people, at least in the long run, which would only make budgeting more difficult?
If we want to find successful solutions to all these questions, we must have the courage to ask them clearly and to come up with some serious answers, and I hope that that is what will happen at our conference.
Finally, I must tell you that the Belgian Presidency - we may be a small country but we are, I think, a realistic one - would like to draft proposals that bear the stamp of realism, because we believe that such realism is the only thing that will enable us to make the progress that is so essential.
If we get lost in ideological or technical considerations, we shall still be debating the question fifteen years hence and we shall still not have made any significant progress.
However, there is an enormous risk, because the people of Europe are waiting for some answers. They have confidence in Europe.
They believe that this is a useful, perhaps even essential, dimension in the solving of such problems.
If we do not succeed in finding answers for our people, I fear that there is a dangerous risk that they will take matters into their own hands, and I am also afraid - and I hope that we in this House share this feeling, at least most of us if not all - that Europe may not be able to remain a Europe of rights and freedoms, a Europe that is welcoming and open, and also, because this is what our fellow citizens are concerned about, a Europe that is prudent and takes precautions, and a Europe that expects all those who find themselves in its territory to respect the rule of law.
Mr President, I am aware that the subject before us is extremely sensitive, particularly at this moment in history.
We have been working - and I refer to this legislature, of course - over the past two years to establish positive relations between citizens and immigrants, to make equal opportunities possible and to create a form of social cohesion.
Now, everyone can see the need to revise certain parts of the agenda we have been working on and, in particular, to identify how the revision of these points can be converted into positive Community legislation allowing us to grow into the kind of Europe we all want.
I would now like to make three points.
Firstly, we need to focus more on defining framework legislation to promote actions at regional and local levels, always in agreement with the Member States, in situations where an initiative is certainly needed to make it easier to balance the three factors which have always been the basis for our analyses of the issue of immigration and asylum. These factors are migration flows, which must be regulated and continuously monitored, integration, and the fight against illegal immigration which is often, sadly, a source of the more major concerns of crime and the exploitation of human beings.
Secondly, we need a thorough debate at European level on the issues which we consider to be vital for our policies such as cooperation between police forces, judicial cooperation, common forms of control and common information systems.
We must make it quite clear what financial resources we should consider adequate and quantifiable in these areas.
Thirdly, we may well have disregarded or underestimated the importance of one of our tasks.
We must insist on the need for the major educational programmes which are the foundations of our culture, and of multiculturalism, in particular: there must be schooling and education starting with foreign children, especially, irrespective of their legal position.
These programmes are fundamental for the policies of integrating and building the societies we want.
In my opinion, we must establish a substantial educational and cultural programme, a major part of which promotes communication between cultures, for that would be the first step along a path which will certainly bring about the sort of integration we desire.
Mr President, I would first like to thank Commissioner Vitorino.
Commissioner, you have listened seriously to the demands made by many experts on migration and NGOs and have made it clear in two communications how policy on refugees and traditional migrants is to be handled.
With your communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status valid throughout the Union for persons granted asylum you have brought forward some excellent proposals for harmonising asylum policy.
Your proposals will now help us to find some concrete solutions.
The rapporteur, Mr Evans, has made a fine job of this.
I regard the additions he proposes as enhancing the current debate on concrete directives.
You have also succeeded, Commissioner, with your communication on a Community migration policy, in making it clear how important it is that future migration in the European Union should be jointly controlled and regulated throughout the Union.
However, we will probably have to carry on debating the wishes of the Nation States, which I take very seriously.
They want to arrange the fine tuning of migration themselves, although their strategies have already been a failure at national level for decades.
I trust that we will soon manage to persuade our colleagues at national level that there is no alternative to Union-wide control of migration.
Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that after the tragic events of 11 September, asylum and immigration policy will be undergoing drastic changes.
In the light of this, it may have been more appropriate to postpone the discussion of these reports because they do not take into consideration recent international developments.
Particular attention should be devoted to the formulation of Paragraph 15 in the Pirker report.
The present document emphasises that the Member States are obliged to respect the rights and duties of third-country nationals.
In my opinion, this is a bridge too far.
Two-way integration is not feasible as long as there is no reciprocity and mutual recognition.
In other words, only if reciprocity and mutual recognition are secured in third countries can two-way integration take place.
The Pirker report has the merit of being frank. It presents immigration as a simple problem of merchandise linked to the needs of the capitalist system.
In effect, the report regards as positive the view that immigration should be envisaged from an economic viewpoint, as a function of the needs and capacities of Member States.
Article 23 could not be clearer. Each Member State has the freedom to define the skills profile and number of workers required on the basis of the needs of its labour market.
In other words, the proposed Community policy on immigration is a quota policy.
By adopting such a position, Europe shows that it is still a long way from recognising the right to immigration.
What we have here is residence permits restricted by the requirements of the bosses and the fantasies of the demographers.
Even the issue of keeping families together is going to be subject to different rules for each group of immigrants, which is the exact opposite of freedom of movement, freedom to select one' s place of business, and the right to live with one' s family.
Massively overexploited, immigrants are the victims of liberal deregulation.
I shall end by saying that only the general regularisation of the position of illegal immigrants plus citizens' rights will enable us to combat effectively the modern slavery which we are being invited to support.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are fully aware that this debate addresses one of the most important and 'hottest' issues at European level: Common asylum and immigration policy.
This situation is the result of two separate factors: firstly, it has come about because the Treaty of Amsterdam granted new competences to the Community, opening up new possibilities for action on a European scale; and secondly, because there has been a considerable increase in migratory pressures from third countries, the devastating effects of which have been highlighted by certain recent tragic events, such as the massive influx of refugees from the Kosovo crisis and the tragedy at Dover.
It is therefore necessary, for both humanitarian and economic reasons, to define a global policy that is able to effectively manage these migratory flows, which currently constitute a legal vacuum, to which the European Union cannot fail to provide a response.
We must take account of the fact that three different types of people are involved in this problem: asylum seekers, temporarily displaced persons and economic migrants.
Although the symptoms are similar, it is important to distinguish the causes and find different answers.
Confusing the status of these people does not help to solve the problems we are facing, and actually makes them worse.
We also know that this external pressure adds to the internal pressure felt by States that are facing a decline in their own population, caused both by a slowdown of population growth and a reduction in the population of working age, with an increasing population of those over the age of 65. Concern is also growing about the sustainability of social security systems.
The answer cannot be to make vain attempts at preventing and halting immigration at Europe' s borders.
The answer lies, instead, in managing and freezing it at current levels. Hence the need for a carefully thought out, clear and coherent common European policy for the management of migratory flows.
In order to prevent new problems emerging, we will have to consider the real labour needs of each Member State and the resources available for the reception and integration of these immigrants.
It must be understood that we incline more to the approach advocated by Mr Pirker.
I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino on his announcement today that, within a month, he will be presenting two initiatives on combating illegal immigration and on repatriation.
Lastly, I wish to emphasise that we need to adopt a prudent approach to a sensitive issue that requires intelligent answers.
It makes more sense, for example, for us to give priority to legalising immigrants who can be integrated into the labour market and who are already on Community territory than encouraging a new wave of immigration.
Mr President, at this stage, the European institutions and this Parliament in particular are fully aware that due to the complexity and importance of the subject we are dealing with today, a legislative programme is needed that will only be effective within the framework of a common and coordinated European approach.
There are many points of agreement between the Commission communication and the reports we are debating today.
We need to develop a more proactive policy which recognises that pressure from migration is set to continue and that properly planned immigration can bring benefits to Europe, to the migrants themselves and also to their countries of origin.
Our aim is to improve the management of migratory movements within the framework of close cooperation with countries of origin and of transit, strengthening the fight against illegal immigration and combating the criminal networks involved, guaranteeing, at the same time, the rights of victims.
What is required is a more open and flexible policy which, in addition to providing greater coordination of policies aimed at reducing migratory pressures and strengthening border controls, could have the benefit of achieving a reduction in illegal immigration that would be advantageous to those very people who truly need the protection that refuge and asylum affords.
We should maintain these levels of protection at all costs, as envisaged in the Geneva Convention, for this is also a sign of European identity that fills us all with a sense of pride.
I would encourage Commissioner Vitorino to continue his good work and to keep to the timetable that has been fixed, and the Council to be equal to the position adopted at Laeken, thereby fulfilling the commitments made at Tampere.
It is time to take practical decisions and not to make statements that are only balanced because of their ambiguity.
These are the hopes and needs of Europe' s citizens.
Mr President, we cannot talk about immigrants and immigration without distinguishing between the different types of immigrants. There are at least three different types of immigrants: political refugees, refugees from war zones and economic migrants.
Once this distinction has been made, it immediately becomes clear that a single asylum law cannot cover all three categories, as Mr Evans proposes.
Not only does this document fail to correspond to reality, it even goes so far as to demonise the Member States which demand the right to decide whether to recognise the right to asylum on a case-by-case basis, depending on the way the society of the country in question is structured and the adequacy of the reception facilities available, without incurring negative repercussions for anyone.
Instinctively, all of us have always been supportive of those who find themselves in the dreadful situation of being forced to leave their own country and apply for asylum in another, but the level of danger to which the rapporteur would have it conceded that all applicants are exposed in their countries of origin is not always acceptable. He is compelling governments and Member States - to put it in colloquial terms - not to make a fuss and to open their gates without delay, invoking the Geneva Convention as if it were a magic password, a skeleton key, rather than what it actually is, a series of guarantees that place those seeking and those granting asylum on an equal footing.
Mr Evans' proposal to establish a common minimum standard - as he calls it - actually invalidates this principle by making it too permissive.
The same may be said of the proposal to introduce a single procedure - as it is called - which, in practice, takes away from the host State any possibility of verifying the suitability of the applicant, who cannot be denied any right, mind you, and whose only obligation is to produce his credentials, as happens among respectable people.
The problem is that refugees and exiles often provide easy cover for decidedly undesirable guests such as drug dealers, traffickers in human beings and terrorists who pretend to be immigrants and then train as pilots and destroy skyscrapers and all the people working inside.
The caution and controls that the rapporteur is denying the States are the fundamental elements of basic, legitimate protection of the States and their citizens.
The Pirker report, which I do support, on a common immigration policy, is much more responsible, not least because it is more balanced, does not make concessions to cheap populism and respects safety measures.
Lastly, to those Members of the left who have attempted once again to bring up the usual controversy against Mr Berlusconi today, I would point out that they are at least a day late.
They should read the Arc-en-ciel; although they have missed the debate, they are still on time for the train of cheap populism and pointless political speculation.
Mr President, thank you for allowing me to take the floor after such a long and full debate.
I believe that there is no doubt at all that the two reports we have seen today prove that we need a common policy on migration and asylum.
I should like, in passing, to pay tribute to the Commissioner' s statement and to all the work that Parliament has carried out, which shows that we attach real importance to these issues, particularly in the current circumstances.
I believe that here today we have been able to make our different views clear, and perhaps we have also made clear the difference between asylum and economic migration.
I am not sure, however, that we have entirely avoided confused thinking.
On the subject of migratory flows and the right of asylum, we must make it clear, in the face of all opposition, that rights and obligations have to be shared, by both migrants and host Member States.
We must not have a situation in which certain people can take advantage of the loopholes in our harmonisation in order to create an underclass of Europeans by introducing second-class workers or deferred citizenship.
It seems to me to be important that the rights of workers, of whatever origin, should be asserted and given tangible expression in order to combat the trafficking in human beings, by which certain people exploit misery and distress.
As for our asylum policy, it will gain in terms of quality and justice if we can agree to recognise that it needs to be supplemented by other compulsory cooperation policies which enable everyone to live with dignity and self-respect in their own countries.
In all cases, asylum policy should reject arbitrary criteria linked to the current situation.
I should also like to ask, simply, that we should also give political rights to those whom we welcome for their work.
Mr President, I would ask Members to ponder one question: is it viable in today's world for all matters of asylum policy to be decided within the parameters of the Geneva Convention?
The Geneva Convention drafted in 1951 was conceived as a temporary measure.
It was negotiated in a very different world - a world still haunted by the shameful failure of Western countries to offer sanctuary to the victims of European fascism.
It was designed first and foremost to ensure that refugees from communist tyranny would have access to safe havens.
But the world has moved on.
Mass air travel has facilitated unprecedented migratory flows.
The great majority of those seeking better lives in new countries are actuated by understandable - indeed laudable - economic motives.
But the terms of the 1951 Convention, and specifically the requirement to assess all claims individually, even if the applicant is manifestly coming from a safe country, encourage economic migrants to seek entry as refugees.
This clogs the system to the disbenefit of those genuinely fleeing from injustice and wrong.
I support, as Mr Pirker's report does, a degree of controlled primary immigration.
All countries can benefit from the energy and enterprise of people who are prepared to cross whole continents in search of a better future.
For such a policy to gain public consent it must be fair and transparent and it must be open to account.
It cannot be right for the judiciaries of our Members States, by applying a peculiar interpretation of the 1951 Convention, to operate an immigration policy beyond the control of elected politicians.
If we want to manage a sustainable policy of legal immigration and, at the same time, protect the rights of those most in need of sanctuary, we must take back control of our asylum laws from the judges.
Far from enlarging the scope of the Geneva Convention, as Mr Evans suggests, we should scrap this outmoded accord and replace it with something more suited to the modern world.
Mr President, today's debate on asylum and immigration is extremely topical, what with insecurity and fear about military operations in the Middle East giving rise to mass movements of desperate people.
Waves of refugees have already reached the European Union, their first port of call being Greece, which is the European Union's closest border with the Middle East.
Ladies and gentlemen, Greek islands are under pressure from an unprecedented influx of refugees and asylum seekers, mainly from Afghanistan.
Greece is having to shoulder a burden which is out of proportion to what it can cope with, which is why the European Union urgently needs to take its share of the responsibility, in this specific case by helping Greece to draw up an integrated joint plan to protect the right of asylum and ensure that the Geneva Convention is fully applied.
Obviously, the sacred right to asylum must not, under any circumstances, be undermined by the measures needed to combat international crime and terrorism.
In any event, mass movements of people will be dealt with under a fairer global policy to reduce inequalities and resolve differences using peaceful means.
Mr President, the increase in the number of asylum seekers over the last few years is causing grave problems for Member States, which are having serious difficulty in coping with the situation.
As Deputy Mayor of the city of Lyon, I see this problem every day.
In my city, the number of conventional asylum seekers has doubled in a little less than a year.
The two Commission communications that we are debating today are certainly an important step forward.
However, we must go further and put an end to the current situation, in which some Member States allow in refugees coming from certain countries whereas others do not.
We must ensure that the countries that receive refugees really do have the means to do so.
In recent times, however, those means have been reduced.
We can no longer receive asylum seekers with dignity.
In our cities we have families living under canvas.
This is absolutely unacceptable. Winter is approaching and we are heading for a catastrophe.
In order to make progress, however, I invite, above all, the governments of Member States and the Council to take the courageous decisions that are necessary.
Insisting on maintaining positions which are too national will end up becoming indecent and irresponsible when the lives of thousands of refugees are at stake and when certain districts in our major European cities are at risk of turning into ghettos.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be very brief, because I know that voting time is approaching.
First of all, I wish to thank you for all your contributions to this debate, including the critical contributions, and clarify two points of criticism I think are important.
First: with regard to the comment by Mr Nassauer, the Commission has not abandoned the principle of the safe third country.
It has not abandoned this principle at all and in fact we are working, in Council, on a definition of a safe third country and I am sure that, as Mr Nassauer said, Mr Schilly will continue to be as tough a negotiator on this matter as he always has been.
With regard to the second aspect, I should like to remind you that the Commission has given itself the task of reviewing its proposals in light of the international situation that has arisen following the terrorist attacks in the United States of America.
The review is now underway.
We shall undertake this task with the utmost rigour and the results will be submitted to Parliament. The Commission does not take a positive view, however, of the implication that there is a link between terrorism and immigration.
The Commission has put forward proposals that respect rights and seek to manage migratory flows. There are also proposals on combating illegal immigration.
Any attempt to portray the Commission as having no initiatives on fighting illegal immigration is unfair.
The proposal for a framework decision against trafficking in human beings adopted by the Council last week is a Commission proposal. The communication on illegal immigration, the communication on repatriation policy and the communication on the joint policing of borders have been on the 'scoreboard' since May 2000 and are part of the Commission' s work programme that was submitted for debate in this Parliament this year.
These are not the result of emergency measures arising from the terrorist attacks; they are an integral part of this Commission' s coherent and consistent immigration policy.
Lastly, I wish to thank Parliament for its support.
I hope that, with the clear ideas that have emerged from this debate, the Laeken European Council will be able to take a step forwards.
These measures provide added value at European level and I thank the European Parliament for its contribution.
(Applause)
Mr President, I feel I must request the floor because I find this situation intolerable and wish to protest at the great number of speeches from large political groups in this Chamber that have sought, this morning, to link terrorism with immigration, asylum seekers and, more than once and in a direct manner, immigration of Islamic origin.
This seems a very irresponsible attitude to me, a time-bomb threatening peaceful coexistence, and I would like to remind you all that many a terrorist with white skin has been born to the world from our own European continent.
Mrs Terrón i Cusí, I am afraid that was not a point of order.
I will not permit any further discussion of this.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
VOTE
Then I suggest that you make an exception and sit in another seat; perhaps the device there works.
I again request the House's services to send a technician to you.
(Parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0303/2001) by Mr Turchi on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty concerning:
1. Amended motion for a Council resolution [COM(2001) 121 - C5-0165/2001 - 2001/0061(CNS)] on the adoption of provisions for the implementation of the Protocol to the Treaty of Nice concerning the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and concerning the Coal and Steel Research Fund
2. Amended motion for a Council resolution [COM(2001) 121 - C5-0166/2001 - 2000/0363(CNS)] on the adoption of the multiannual financial guidelines for the administration of the assets of the 'ECSC in liquidation' with, following completion of the liquidation, the 'Assets of the Coal and Steel Research Fund'
3. Communication from the Commission to the Council [COM(2000) 518 - C5-0204/2001 - 2001/2095(COS)], the European Parliament, the Advisory Committee of the ECSC, the Committee on Economic and Social and the Committee of the Regions - expiry of the ECSC Treaty: financial activities after 2002
Before the final vote on the first proposal
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the reasons I expressed yesterday and considering the fact that you have adopted my legislative amendments, I call upon you to postpone the vote on the legislative resolutions until the possibility of an agreement with the Commission and the Council increasing Parliament' s role, pursuant to Rule 69 (2) of the Rules of Procedure, can be ascertained.
I therefore call upon you to vote on the motion which is not a legislative resolution, to make the political positions of this House on the matter quite clear.
We now come to a proposal, in accordance with Rule 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, to adjourn the vote, and we shall now proceed to vote on it.
(Parliament adopted the proposal) President.
The matter is accordingly referred back for reconsideration to the committee responsible.
Before the final vote on the second proposal:
Mr President, I repeat what I said just now, that is, I call upon you not to vote on the legislative resolution but to vote on the following motion, which is not a legislative resolution.
We now come to a proposal, in accordance with Rule 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, to adjourn the vote, and we shall now proceed to vote on it.
(Parliament adopted the proposal) President.
The matter is accordingly referred back for reconsideration to the committee responsible.
(Parliament adopted the motion for a resolution)
Report (A5-0297/2001) by Mr Linkohr on behalf of the Committee for Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the guidelines for the research programme of the Coal and Steel Research Fund on the amended Council motion for a resolution [COM(2001) 121 - C5-0167/2001 - 2000/0364(CNS)] on the adoption of the multiannual technical guidelines for the research programme of the Coal and Steel Research Fund.
Before the vote:
Mr President, in view of the Commission's response to the debate last night and, in particular, to my colleague Mr Mombaur's point on the expiry of the Coal and Steel Treaty, the protocol attached to the Treaty of Nice and the legal uncertainty now surrounding that, I would ask the rapporteur to comment on this point.
Would he be in favour of referring it to our own legal services as the Commission is apparently about to do?
Mr Linkohr, as rapporteur, has the floor.
Mr President, as rapporteur I cannot but agree with that.
Not being myself a lawyer either, I would be interested to know what the Commission's position would be in the event of Nice not being ratified before the Treaty expires, for then, or so my reasonable human understanding tells me, a legal vacuum results, and that is something we should have looked into.
In that respect I would like to support Mrs Ahern in what she has said.
Having already, however, been called to speak, I wanted to point out to you that Amendments Nos 1 to 5 are founded on a misunderstanding.
We did not vote on them at all in committee.
They may well be substantially included in the Turchi report - there is no need for anybody to worry about that - but I recommend that we should not vote on them today, and, insofar as I am entitled to demand such a thing, I demand that.
I would gladly submit that to this House's decision.
I shall call for a vote on Mr Linkohr's motion, but not on Amendments Nos 1 to 5.
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
Before the final vote:
In this instance, I ask for a vote on the legislative resolution, in particular because of items 8 and 9, on which we have just voted.
In my judgment, it is sufficient if we proceed to examine the Turchi report, but because of items 8 and 9, I would really attach importance to us now actually voting on the resolution.
I ask you to vote in favour of it.
(Parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution.)
Explanation of vote - Turchi Report (A5-0303/2001) and Linkohr Report (A5-0297/2001):
. (FR) The two reports on the expiry of the ECSC Treaty state - and deplore the fact - that the Council is asking Parliament to give it discharge regarding activities which it has no means of controlling.
In other words, Parliament may vote for what it wants but it will be the Council who decides.
That is certainly one way of recognising that Parliament serves only to give the stamp of democracy to decisions which are not democratic.
These two reports also state that the so-called social aspect of the ECSC is to be abandoned, precisely when we are envisaging the accession of countries on which the European Union intends to impose the restructuring of their coal and steel sectors so as to make them profitable, profitable, that is, to possible Western investors.
In spite of this 'social aspect' of the ECSC, the restructuring of coal and steel in Western Europe has resulted in the dismissal of hundreds of thousands of workers, a disaster for many people.
Some regions, such as Lorraine, have taken years to recover from the companies that were closed down and the jobs that were lost.
We can imagine what it will be like for the workers of Poland, the Czech Republic or Hungary, who will not even have the chance of compensation or early retirement.
Rather than using the balance from the liquidation of the ECSC as a research fund, which will in one form or another profit the bosses, the sums released in this way should be used in their entirety to continue to pay the wages of the workers who will be thrown out onto the street as a result of future restructuring programmes.
We have therefore voted against these two reports.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.24 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Arms exports
The next item is the report (A5-0309/2001) by Mr Titley, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Council's Second Annual Report according to Operative Provision 8 of the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports [13177/1/2000 - C5-0111/2001 - 2001/2050(COS)].
Mr President, 11 September showed us that the world we live in is very insecure.
We discovered that the world's security, stability and economy are much more fragile than we previously believed.
Wherever we look - whether at the fight against terrorism, the horrors of the Balkans, the nightmare of a small town in Switzerland, the virtual anarchy in parts of Africa - one common theme emerges everywhere: the huge number of weapons which are freely available.
That is one of the main causes of instability in the world, and we must act before the tidal wave of weaponry overwhelms us all.
The Code of Conduct on Arms Exports was a significant development in controlling this trade.
It is clear from the second annual report that there is rapidly growing cooperation between Member States, both in terms of implementing the code and of achieving greater mutual understanding of the interpretation of the code.
It is also clear that arms export policy in relation to security is becoming more closely aligned.
There is much greater transparency in arms controls policies.
Most EU States, except for Austria, Greece and Luxembourg, now produce their own annual reports, albeit with a huge variance in the quality of information provided.
It is worth noting that the NGOs' Safer World holds up the UK's annual report, first introduced by the then Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, as an example for other countries.
The code's influence goes beyond the EU: all the accession countries, the EEA, EFTA States, Canada and Turkey now subscribe to the code's principles.
Member States are also seeking to apply those principles in wider international fora.
It would be a mistake to underestimate the importance of what has been achieved or the considerable mindshift that is taking place among Member States in this field.
Nonetheless, there are areas where the code needs to be strengthened.
The principles of the code will be constantly undermined if action is not taken to control and license arms brokers.
It is beyond belief that in many countries you need a licence to own a shotgun but not to trade in weapons of any type.
Some arms brokers are legitimate businesses; many, however, are little more than merchants of death.
Action in this field must be an absolute priority.
Similarly, controlling the activities of EU armaments companies will inevitably be compromised by the uncontrolled licensing of production outside the EU.
We further need a more harmonised system of end-use data provision, certification and enforcement.
Controls of official exports are important, but the illegal trade in arms is our biggest problem.
I welcome the work of Member States towards a UN Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons, reminding Parliament that the definition includes things like shoulder-carried, anti-aircraft missiles.
I very much regret the attitude of the USA to that conference and the influence of its gun lobby.
We can only hope that recent events will cause the USA to reflect on the need for global partnerships to remove the causes of insecurity.
We must have a global crackdown on this illegal trade.
Greater transparency is the guardian of our security in this field.
Despite the rapid advances made, I would like to see all countries producing publicly available annual export reports in a commonly agreed format.
The Council's annual report ought to be more detailed, as I have set out in my report.
We would naturally encourage greater scrutiny of arms policies by Member State parliaments.
I was delighted that last year Member States agreed a Common List of Military Equipment to which the code applies.
We now need a common list of non-military security and police equipment, and I am happy to accept the amendments on that subject.
The list, however, has to be meaningful and provide the basis of effective action in this field and not be a statement of general intent.
We will not win the war on terrorism - which we are all talking about at the moment - unless we control arms, the tools of this deadly trade.
That is the challenge confronting us now and it is even more important today than it was this time last year when we debated the first annual report.
Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Titley on his very sound and constructive report.
His efforts, as well as useful contributions by other fellow MEPs, have enabled this Parliament to reach more or less consensus on an otherwise very sensitive issue: the control of the arms trade.
In light of the attacks in America, there is growing awareness of the fact that the vast distribution of arms worldwide leads to unstable countries which form the breeding ground for terrorism.
The Titley report rightly points out that the 1998 EU Code is a major step forward towards a more coherent and transparent European policy on arms exports.
At the same time, however, a number of shortcomings and flaws have been flagged, five of which I should like mention.
First of all, the annual reports of the Member States are not harmonised.
Some countries, including Great Britain and Ireland, give a detailed account of the permits issued and of the amount and value of exported arms.
Other countries, such as Austria and Greece, give no information whatsoever about the licences issued.
In that way, an efficient, effective assessment is, of course, difficult.
The annual report would, therefore, need to meet a number of standards.
Each permit issued should be accompanied by a detailed description of the material, the addressee and end user.
For permits refused, the reason for refusal should be explained in more detail.
Secondly, in my opinion, the monitoring procedures concerning the end user of the exported arms should be stepped up.
In Africa, Togo and Burkina Faso are officially the end users of arms supplied from Bulgaria, whilst in reality, these are passed on to Liberia and the rebels of Sierra Leone.
Embassies of EU Member States could play a more supervisory role in situ.
Penal measures should also be introduced for transit countries that violate arms embargos.
Thirdly, I am of the opinion that tighter controls should be in place for the production of military equipment under licence abroad by EU companies or in the framework of industrial joint venture agreements.
It is not acceptable for a certain country to be refused a licence for weapons and for arms manufacturers to be able to circumvent that ban by supplying arms components which are then assembled on site.
A fourth shortcoming is that there is no control whatsoever on private arms dealers, the number of which is rising all the time since the end of the cold war.
Of the five hundred million light arms in circulation worldwide, forty to sixty percent of these are illegal, according to the UN.
A final serious shortcoming of the EU Code of Conduct is that it is not legally binding.
At the moment, it is a no-strings-attached gentlemen' s agreement.
Sanctions cannot be imposed on those who breach the Code.
Finally, I should like to express the hope that the EU Code of Conduct will form the basis for a worldwide code on the export of arms.
It makes no sense whatsoever for Europe to be committed to controlling the arms trade, while China and Russia continue to export weapons to crisis areas without any restrictions.
In that sense, the UN Conference in July was a missed opportunity, and I believe that this topic must remain a permanent feature in the transatlantic dialogue.
Mr President, Mr Titley has lived up to his reputation and has produced an excellent report on the Code of Conduct concerning arms exports, on which we would like to congratulate him.
Needless to say, the report receives the full backing of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
That is why I should not so much like to confine myself to the technicalities of the report, but rather to a number of general observations.
On 11 September, the first reports rolled in about the horrific attacks in the United States during the vote of the Titley report in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
The European Union has reacted adequately and coherently.
All available means are being deployed right across the pillars.
One would wish for the same promptness of action in other areas too.
The EU can do anything if it puts its mind to it.
Where the arms export is concerned, we have to make do with a Code of Conduct which is considerably restricted by Article 296 of the EC Treaty which protects national security interests.
That is such a vague concept that Member States, if they so wish, can more or less do their own thing.
In fact, it has never been clear to me in what way national security interests can be different from those of the European Union.
The arms export agreements are also typified by a large degree of voluntariness, but also, for example, by inconsistent agreements on the end use of exported arms.
That is why an EU-wide and effective approach is lacking.
Not all relevant information is made available, which obstructs the transparency of the policy.
Annual reports are useful, but joint action is preferable, of course.
Mr Titley' s report mentions a few areas which require attention, such as the destabilising distribution of hand-held weapons.
That causes great chaos in some parts of the world.
The trade in these weapons also sustains phenomena such as child soldiers.
My group would like to turn this into a priority, also in cooperation with the candidate countries, the countries of the Stability Pact and countries such as Ukraine and Russia, for we know that many of the hand-held weapons which are in circulation in the world originate from those countries.
The EU must make every effort, together with those countries, to tackle the often criminal trade in weapons.
Here too we require a new international coalition.
In the light of 11 September, it is important to tighten the agreements on the export of so-called dual-use goods.
I am curious about the discussions which are undoubtedly already taking place behind the scenes.
The citizens would like to know how the export policy will be adopted to prevent the wrong expertise from falling into the wrong hands.
I would quote the reports on terrorism and the use of weapons of mass destruction in this connection.
Here too, better cooperation with Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States is necessary.
What will happen to the export of encryption software?
Will new arrangements be made in this connection?
The least we can ask from the Council and the Commission is to indicate the role which can improve the organised arms export policy in the fight against terrorism.
As far as I am concerned, the debate on Article 296 can be re-opened.
Arms export must form an integral part of the new EU security policy.
Only then will it be truly effective.
Mr President, I welcome much of what is in the report, particularly the need for transparency, the issue dealing with the end use of weapons and the illegal trade in arms.
As Mr Titley mentioned, the control of small arms is important.
It is a major problem, as we have seen from the tragic events in Switzerland.
There needs to be a mechanism to control non-military security and police equipment.
But I do not support the idea of a European defence industry and we need to look at getting rid of the defence industry.
The recent tragic events in the United States have actually given a shot in the arm to the arms industries.
I will mention one in particular because it is relevant to Ireland, and that is Raytheon.
This company has seen a 40% jump in share prices as a result of the events of 11 September and thereafter.
We must look at the whole issue of arms production in the first place.
I mentioned Raytheon because it is ironic that, in spite of the peace process in Northern Ireland, Nobel peace prize winners stood on a platform welcoming into Derry Raytheon, one of the world's biggest arms manufacturing companies.
It is appalling to encourage manufacturers of weapons, or their components, into a place where people are killing each other every day with weapons so that these products can then be transported to other parts of the world to cause havoc and deprivation.
We do not want peace here and wars in other parts of the world.
We should look at ending the trade in weapons completely and the idea of government support for an industry that is responsible for death and destruction around the world is unacceptable.
As regards torture weapons, we have a situation where these weapons are being sent to certain parts of the world with an EU stamp on them.
This is completely unacceptable.
In my own country, Ireland, there has in recent times been an increase in the arms industry, mainly involving US-based arms manufacturing.
This manufacturing comprises mainly components, but irrespective of whether components or end-use weapons are concerned, we should not accept the production of weapons.
There are far more beneficial ways of creating employment for people in a given area than the production of something that is used to kill another human being.
Mr President, in principle our group agrees with the report by Mr Titley, who has done an excellent job in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
There are some aspects of the report that we do not agree with, such as that referring to the defence industry, but, generally speaking, this effort to achieve transparency and for the EU to play a crucial, I would say leading, role in the process of world disarmament and also in achieving peace is positive, and, for this reason, we think that it is a good report.
However, there are various aspects that could be improved, especially following the sad events of 11 September, since when North America has been promoting the indiscriminate sale of arms to all those it considers to be potential allies in the fight against terrorism.
We think that this is an appropriate moment to adopt clearly transparent behaviour that would avoid these double standards, and for this reason we, through our colleague Mr Brie, have tabled several amendments which seek specifically to prevent such problems - such as cases, for example, in which arms are indirectly sold to countries that contravene EU agreements through third countries, as is the case, for example, with Turkey, or Israel, bombing or attacking the Palestinians, or Pakistan. For this reason it would be a good idea to have more control over these sales.
We also think that it is important - as stated by Mr Titley in his speech - to include terrorism as an objective.
Lastly, we also think it imperative, in order to improve transparency, for the Commission itself to draw up a report that clarifies this series of measures so that the role of the EU can be much greater and more decisive in achieving a world at peace and without arms.
Mr President, those who declare that they are dedicated to fighting terrorism need to cleanse themselves of all hypocrisy and must condemn those who carry out the worst acts of bloodletting under the guise of freedom fighters.
In Dublin this weekend, Gerry Adams boasted that the IRA campaign of atrocities were the acts of freedom fighters and not the acts of terrorists.
No wonder The Wall Street Journal the other day carried an article with Adams and bin Laden linked together.
Actions, not words alone, can cleanse the hands of those nations in Europe which have both armed and furthered the aims of terrorists and have then refused to extradite those criminals for proper trial.
Mr President, until a few weeks ago, the distinction between conventional weaponry such as light and heavy arms, on the one hand and weapons of mass destruction on the other, in other words, nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, seemed relatively clear.
Now the very concepts of what constitutes a weapon are in doubt, when a civilian aeroplane can become a missile when guided by a murderous ideal.
We may be tempted to adopt an attitude which is at once relativist, with regard to the means, and ultra-safe, with regard to actions.
I would say, however, that there is now a greater need than ever to prevent tendencies that are not firmly anchored in politics.
Particularly at a time when, as is becoming obvious, we need to speed up the construction of our common foreign and security policy, which must be given the appropriate resources and be supported by an effective shared commitment.
This policy must go ahead on the basis of cohesion, which also means trust between Member States, and of coherence between the ideas that are put forward and practical action.
We are today discussing an issue, arms exports, to which these principles must be applied, today more than ever before.
It would, of course, be better if there were no need to discuss weapons, but, unfortunately, the world we live in is not like that.
The European Union' s Code of Conduct on arms exports adopted in 1999 is a key instrument for harmonisation and control in this field.
With regard to the Council' s second annual report, on implementing this Code of Conduct, the rapporteur himself welcomes the greater transparency and the convergence between Member States arms exports policies and the adoption of common principles by third countries. He also, however, highlights the need to go further, putting an end to illegal sales and exercising greater control over arms dealers' fees and on the destination of arms.
I therefore support the thrust of this report, although once again, I wish to emphasise the need for coherence and cohesion in this field.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is naturally useful to have a report on arms trade.
That is also true of a European Code of Conduct.
But I hope that the tragic circumstances in which we find ourselves will also galvanise us into action, for example in order to render this Code of Conduct compulsory, as Mr Titley rightly pointed out in his report, and finally to also make progress in supervising the arms trade.
For although that is what we intend to do, if we have no control over the end-user certificate, it is impossible to check whether that arms trade is legal or not.
Similarly, the production under licence by EU countries in third countries is another one of such issues.
Ultimately, we will need to reach the stage where we have black lists of countries to which we do not under any circumstance supply weapons.
This will need to be monitored and sanctions will need to be put in place.
Mr President, I congratulate Mr Titley on his work and acknowledge his endeavours to include the point of view of civil society on arms exports.
I would, however, mention certain negative points: firstly, light weapons.
The UN Conference in July was a failure: in my opinion, the EU should commit itself resolutely once more to enforcing a reduction.
As regards transparency, I feel that this is still too superficial and that Parliamentary scrutiny should be obligatory for arms exports.
Then there is no reference to the OCCAT Agreement which actually protects industrial cooperation and is the basis for laws such as Italy' s which make it possible to export arms without infringing human rights rules.
Then there is an arms exports control policy which must be in line with European common foreign policy.
In short, I consider the Titley report to be important, but I feel - this is my point of view and is not a criticism of the Titley report - that the European Union should, in these tragic times, set itself the target of disarmament, not rearmament.
You will excuse me, Commissioner, for addressing you alone, but the Council benches are empty.
I would like to say that I find the Council report very interesting. This Code of Conduct is also of major importance and this debate is very dignified, although we should ask ourselves how much we are actually achieving.
We must have the courage to go deeper into certain complex issues which are still to be resolved.
The first of these issues, which has already been mentioned by all those who have spoken, is the need to make this code law, that is to convert it into a legally binding instrument, seeing as, nowadays, everything depends on the good will of the Member States of the European Union, which are even free to decide whether or not to submit an annual report, which not all the Member States have chosen to do.
Another complex issue which has yet to be resolved is that of a Community system of controlling the end use, the final recipient of the arms exported and the brokers who, in the arms trade, in arms trafficking - the word trafficking may be more appropriate, more to the point - are the real money-makers.
It is a matter of serious concern that all this is not happening, that we do not have such a control facility, bearing in mind, for example, that the Taliban will probably be fighting in Afghanistan with arms supplied by the West, including some of the countries of the European Union.
Lastly, the candidate countries.
What guarantees will we have that the candidate countries will be able to respect this Code of Conduct properly?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as regards these questions, there is only one risk, which is engendered by our hypocrisy in disregarding - as has been pointed out - the great difference between a gentleman' s agreement and a law.
I will therefore close by reiterating that, until the Code of Conduct becomes law, we will be at fault, and this report' s due reference to the values of democracy and the protection of human rights is likely to be reduced to a mere, ineffective appeal.
Mr President, the report is more critical on the subject of the export of weapons than any previous report by Mr Titley.
Despite this, we must observe that its demands do not reach their target either as regards parliamentary scrutiny or as regards transparency.
As far as parliamentary scrutiny is concerned, there is no demand for formal provision for an opinion by the European Parliament, and that is the least we can ask for if we are to have some degree of influence.
I take an even more critical line on what is said about transparency.
Here, Mr Titley speaks of transparency in the form of a framework agreement.
We know, however, that the framework agreement between six EU States to promote the defence of industry and of a global defence market is precisely the most opaque procedure ever, that it clasps tightly what it used to give: no parliamentary scrutiny and no debate, even on the conclusion and ratification of this agreement.
That must be changed.
Mr President, one thing for sure is that the excessive profits reaped by multinationals, especially American multinationals, from manufacturing and selling arms far exceed the profits to be made from drug trafficking or crude oil.
Tensions, armed conflict and mutual genocide are being provoked and fomented in order to promote the production and consumption of all sorts of arms and munitions, thereby increasing sales and boosting profits.
And governments have no objection; in fact they are doing their utmost here, given that, as we all know, they cream off huge sums of money from manufacturers supplying arms.
Whatever Mr Titley's intentions as rapporteur, in today's general climate of militarisation and warmongering, with a new structure to NATO, with the militarisation of the European Union and, more importantly, with the shameless exploitation of the terrorist attack in the United States, codes like this, even if they do not pull the wool over the people's eyes, are no more than a hypocritical wish list.
We believe that strict controls are needed and that the manufacture of all types of equipment - and not just exports as the report suggests - should be denied, if not banned.
In the final analysis, however, this is a matter for the popular front, for the global and national peace movement which, as we have seen recently, is burgeoning - and thank God it is.
Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Titley for another excellent and characteristically intelligent report, which we have read with very great interest.
As his report and his speech have made clear, the issue of arms exports is tremendously complex and close collaboration is required by everyone in order to address its many different angles.
There were a number of good speeches in the debate, some of which referred to the relevance of the appalling events of 11 September and their aftermath.
I should like to respond to what Mr Paisley had to say.
As he is not in his place, maybe my remarks will be borne to him on angels' wings.
I agree with the definitional point he made.
It is an enormously important point for us to make.
Some of us from Spain or the United Kingdom have personal experience of this; some of us have friends who have been murdered by terrorists.
There is no such thing as a good terrorist.
There is no distinction between good and bad terrorism.
What is a terrorist?
A terrorist is a man or woman or, alas, a deluded child who sets out in the morning to murder innocent men, women and children to make a political point - the propaganda of the deed.
That is not justified.
It is never justified.
There are never extenuating circumstances, any more than there are ever extenuating circumstances from extrajudicial killings by a State.
So I hope that when we start talking about definitions we will remember what terrorism really is.
We will have views about the political roots of terrorism.
We will have strong views about the importance of trying to find political solutions to some problems.
However, I hope we will not be morally confused about what constitutes a terrorist act.
During the debate on last year's report, I stated that the ultimate responsibility for arms exports belongs to national governments.
However, it is also clear that some aspects of the arms trade lie within the remit of the common foreign and security policy, with which the Commission is fully associated.
The Commission is making every effort to move forward with the implementation of those recommendations which lie within Community competence and we stand ready to collaborate with Member States where joint responsibilities are involved, for example when one is talking about dual-use goods.
As Parliament is already aware, the associated countries of central and eastern Europe, Cyprus, Turkey, Malta, and our EEA/EFTA partners have issued declarations through which they align themselves with the criteria and the principles contained in the European Union's Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.
The Union has continued to assist the candidates in their efforts to bring their legislation and administration fully into line with the provisions of the code.
Furthermore, the European Union continues to urge the world's main arms exporters to subscribe to the principles and criteria developed in our code.
We would react most favourably to the idea of drafting an international code of conduct on arms transactions, on the condition that it is based on the same principles as the European Union code.
The Commission strongly supports the honourable Member's call for the establishment of common rules for European Union control of the legal trade in small arms and light weapons, as well as effective European Union controls to combat and eradicate trafficking in these arms.
In this respect we welcome the agreement reached at the July 2001 UN Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons.
Although the final text falls well short of the Union's initial expectations, it marks an important step forward. It represents a delicate and hard-fought compromise, which would not have been achievable only a couple of years ago.
If all parties involved were to adopt a more positive attitude, the agreement would become a more effective tool for addressing the concerns of all participants in the future.
For the first time the international community has set out some principles for national and international measures which might curb the illegal trade in small arms.
They aim to establish reliable controls on the production, export and transit of weapons; to apply reliable markings to them in order to trace their origin more successfully; to criminalise their unlicensed production and trade; to regulate the activities of brokers; and to destroy surplus stockpiles and all confiscated weapons.
A new conference will be held no later than 2006 - I suspect that recent events may bring that date forward - and in the intervening period, biennial meetings will consider the progress made on turning the objectives of the conclusions into tangible reality.
We will work hard with the Member States to ensure an active and ambitious follow-up.
The European Union's commitment to concrete action in the field of small arms is illustrated by a number of projects currently under way or under consideration in different parts of the world.
In Cambodia the European Union gives technical, administrative and financial support to the government and selected NGOs for actions aimed at promoting the collection, control and destruction of weapons.
We also support Operation Rachel, a joint South Africa-Mozambique project, to collect and destroy arms left over since the civil war.
We provide equipment to the Georgian and Ossetian police forces as part of a programme which consists of the voluntary handover and subsequent destruction of small arms in the region.
We also support the UN Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Lima, which works to promote the control of small arms in Latin America and the Caribbean.
We are also considering further projects in the Balkans, Africa and South Pacific.
During the past few months Commission services have begun drafting EC legislation on a number of non-military items such as instruments of torture, to which the provisions of the code should, in our view, apply.
Work is now near completion, and the Commission intends to submit a proposal to the Council soon.
This marks a first step in tackling the issue.
Compilation of a more extended list, which might include items that also have civilian uses - instruments of internal repression such as riot-control equipment, for example - would require the commitment of significant additional resources.
If we are going to take on such a task - which involves establishing the eventual end use of the items and, perhaps, the identity of the end user - then we shall need more resources.
However we will, of course, pay careful attention to what Parliament has to say on that issue.
Progress in that field is conditional on the willingness of Member States and Parliament to make additional resources available for these purposes.
So I repeat our gratitude to the honourable Member, Mr Titley, for an important report.
I hope that year by year we can continue to respond constructively to what he has to say.
Anybody who looks at the violence around the world, the violence often associated with the breakdown of States, from Somalia to Sudan, to Sierra Leone, to Afghanistan; anybody who looks at the situation created by the breakdown of States knows how much the trade and small arms is responsible for continuing the violence and making the violence far more lethal.
So this report is an important one, and I hope we can respond to it over the coming months and years with appropriately constructive behaviour.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Political and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan
The next item is the Commission statement on the political and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan.
I shall ask Commissioner Patten to take the floor immediately.
I should like to begin the Commission's contribution myself and then at the end of the discussion ask Commissioner Nielson to say something about the humanitarian situation in which he has been actively involved because of his responsibility for ECHO.
If I have to leave before the end of the discussion it is not for lack of appreciation of the importance of what we are discussing - I believe this issue is going to dominate the international agenda for the next few months - but because I have to attend an important meeting before the EU-Russia Summit with the Deputy-Premier of the Russian Federation to discuss the modalities for beginning discussions on a common European economic area.
We will try to agree the terms of reference of our work this evening before our summit with President Putin tomorrow.
There will be other reports on the Troika visit that I took part in last week with the Foreign Minister of Belgium, which holds the presidency, and with the Foreign Minister of Spain - the next presidency - which demonstrated our commitment to the issues we were discussing.
With my friend and colleague Mr Solana we went to Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria, all in the space of four-and-a-half action-packed, sleep-free days and nights.
I should just like to say two or three words about that visit and make two or three points about the political situation in Afghanistan, leaving the humanitarian issues, which are of such compelling importance, to Commissioner Nielson.
Then I would like to say a word about a draft regulation which the Commission has today adopted.
The main purposes of the Troika visit were three-fold.
First of all, we wanted to make the point clearly to the Islamic countries we were visiting that the campaign against terrorism is not a campaign of the West against Islam.
It is not a campaign of Europe and North America against the poorer countries of the globe.
It is a campaign of decent governments everywhere against those who would try to make their political point through murder and mayhem.
It is a fight, in my judgment, between those who stand up in favour of civilisation, of a number of different religious bases and those who represent the forces which have always been opposed to civilised values.
We made that point strongly in every country we went to.
For me, it is very important to recognise that if we are to make the point around the world that human rights are universally valid, including the right not to be murdered by terrorists - if we are to make that point successfully around the world - it is very important for us not to give the impression that we have a monopoly of virtue, that we in Europe are perfect when it comes to talking about these matters.
It is also exceptionally important for us not to concede that human rights bear a different weight according to the continent you are in.
It feels exactly the same to be tortured, whatever sort of country you are in.
It is exactly the same if you are locked up as a journalist or an editor because you disagree with the government, whatever country you are in.
Those sort of rights are universally valid.
It seems to me that we dilute the integrity of our argument if we give the impression that somehow different civilisations have fundamentally different approaches to human rights.
The second point we were seeking to make is that out of the appalling events, out of the atrocities of 11 September, we must hope that it is possible for some good to come.
Adversity sometimes produces an opportunity to be constructive, positive and to build better for the future.
One thing we said in Pakistan, Iran and elsewhere is that we have a chance now - taking account of the awful things that have happened - of opening some doors and windows which have been closed for too long.
Thirdly, we say that it is a cliché, a truism when people talk about 11 September to say - rather like the fall of the Berlin Wall - nothing will ever be the same again. But it is actually true.
Nothing will ever be quite the same again.
One way in which we have to make sure that nothing is ever the same again is to try to ensure this time that multilateralism, that international cooperation, works a great deal more effectively in the wake of those awful events than it perhaps has since the 1940s.
That is the challenge to us: to make sure that when we discuss conventions against terrorism in the UN, everybody signs them and everybody implements them.
Those are the sort of practical challenges that we are going to face for weeks and months and years in the future when these events are no longer on the front pages of the newspapers.
Those were three points that we - the only four-person Troika in the business - were making insistently at each of our stops.
Concerning the political situation in Afghanistan, which we were able to discuss both in Pakistan and in Iran, there were of course different views of the situation.
In Iran, for example, there are very strong views about the Taliban. That is not surprising given the number of Iranian diplomats that were killed three or so years ago by the Taliban in Afghanistan.
There is a general agreement that the political situation in Afghanistan remains extremely fluid.
There are reports from neighbouring countries that the Taliban are in terminal decline.
There are also reports that speak of some Taliban military successes and of a return to what passes for a sort of grim normality in Kabul.
The Taliban continue to show no real sign of being ready to give up Osama bin Laden or forcefully to encourage his voluntary departure from the country.
The opposition Northern Alliance has declared itself ready and willing to assist the United States and international coalition efforts.
Following the death of Commander Masood on 8 September - and I know he made an important visit to Parliament not long ago - there is greater uncertainty as to the cohesion of this alliance.
What is certain is that no wholly military solution is possible in Afghanistan.
In both Pakistan and Iran, where as I said there are very different views of the situation in Afghanistan, there was agreement that only a broad-based government made up of representatives of all factions and ethnic groups in the country, taking account of the security concerns of neighbouring countries, can begin the process of restoring Afghanistan to normality and pave the way for reconstruction.
The means of doing this may be through the Loya Jirga or Grand Assembly mechanism.
It would be for the Afghan people to decide what kind of Loya Jirga process they want and what role different political personages might play in such a development.
I repeat that there is a shared perception of what the outcome should be: a broad-based government.
How you get to that broad-based government is incomparably more difficult to work out, but there is also a shared perception that the world outside - even in the shape of the United Nations - cannot impose a political settlement on Afghanistan.
We can and should aim to facilitate a political settlement, and having facilitated it not then walk away.
We have to make sure that a better government, which will emerge from that sad, embittered country will be able to count on the long-term support of the international community to rebuild from the ruin of the medieval ferocity which has been unleashed on Afghanistan for the last few years.
I should like to make one other point.
We have in the Commission today adopted a draft regulation on specific measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating international terrorism.
The draft proposal includes all those individuals and organisations potentially related to the 11 September attack covered by the US Executive Order issued by President Bush last week.
But it takes the form of a framework regulation which could serve as the vehicle for a wider campaign against terrorist financing.
There is a considerable urgency to this regulation, which is put forward on the basis of Article 308, for reasons which I am sure I do not have to set out for Parliament.
In these circumstances we would be extremely grateful if Parliament could consider an emergency procedure, if possible completing the consultation process during this week's part-session.
We would then be able to put the draft regulation to the General Affairs Council next Monday.
I know that the President of the Commission will be writing to you on these lines, Madam President.
We understand the difficulties.
We do not want in any way to curtail examination of this important measure; but if it could be done very rapidly it would send the right signals.
It would be an opportunity to demonstrate that in exceptional circumstances the Community institutions can act with real despatch.
Not only would we thereby signal the strength of our determination to rise to the challenges presented by the 11 September attack, but we would show that the EU institutions are able to respond to crisis situations.
I will finish my remarks with that point.
So far, in the proposals brought forward by my friend and colleague, Mr Vitorino, a couple of weeks ago, we have demonstrated that though we are sometimes the butt of people's humour about the lack of speed of our reactions, when it really matters we are able to react very rapidly and comprehensively and we are able to demonstrate in practice what multilateralism should mean.
If there is any institution in the world, if there is any group of countries in the world that can demonstrate the benefits of multilateralism, of arguing about fish quotas or budgets, rather than murdering one another, it is the European Union.
That seems to me to give us a particular responsibility to show leadership in the coming weeks and months and I hope we will be able to do so with this regulation this week.
Madam President, as Mr Patten stated, with four aircraft carriers heading towards the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, the very least that can be said of the situation in Afghanistan is that it is uncertain.
Even the President of Pakistan - a country where over the last few days there have been huge demonstrations of support for the Taliban regime - has unambiguously stated that the days of the regime are numbered.
The offer to open up the government of three Afghan provinces and the exodus of people fleeing the country to avoid being mobilised against potential intervention by the international alliance clearly suggest that this is true.
If, to this fact we add the decision made yesterday in Rome to create a Supreme Council of National Unity instructed to form a provisional government and name a Head of State, we can truly arrive at the conclusion that the situation in Afghanistan is changing from one day to the next.
So, Madam President, in this context, what attitude should the European Union adopt?
Well, in my opinion, the European Union, faced with the crisis situation in this region, should present itself as an element of stability and moderation.
The EU should contribute to the establishment of a democratic government in Afghanistan.
The EU should encourage the full application in that country of respect for human rights and fundamental liberties, which the Taliban regime refuses to acknowledge, as proposed by the mission led by Commissioner Patten and the Troika.
At the same time, the European Union has to sign up to the international alliance referred to yesterday by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at their General Assembly.
Lastly, Madam President, the European Union should give its support to an enormous humanitarian task.
We should not forget that 25% of the 22 million Afghans will survive thanks exclusively to international aid.
However, Madam President, it is important that the European Union does not commit a series of errors.
Firstly, that of supporting governments that do not have sufficient popular support, as happened in the first Afghan crisis a decade ago.
Secondly, the European Union should not commit the error of carrying out indiscriminate actions and of not pursuing tangible objectives.
For we should not forget, Madam President, that our objective should not be to dominate a country that certainly holds a strategic position, but not to encourage the action of extremist elements that could cause the overthrow of regimes such as those in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan or Egypt that would make Bin Laden a martyr or a political military leader or, something that would be far more serious, a religious or spiritual leader.
I think that in conclusion, Madam President, we need to give our total support to Mr Patten' s proposal and behave with maximum diligence and efficiency to support the Commission' s proposals today.
Madam President, Afghanistan is a country with an average income per inhabitant of USD 800.
This statistic makes it the poorest country in Asia and the world' s fifth poorest country.
There are some five million people who rely on food programmes.
Millions of people live on the Iranian side of the border, millions of others live on the Pakistani side.
The borders are now closed, but it is expected that another million people will end up fleeing.
The hands of the WFP and UNHCR are tied, for they cannot work in that country.
There are a few other international NGOs which boast sound structures and can offer aid.
Over the past few years, the Commission has granted a great deal of aid via the ECHO programme.
I should like to hear Commissioner Nielson give us an extensive account on this in a moment.
We know that we are extremely limited in what we can do.
We, as Europe, must do more.
We cannot cross the borders.
We can use the structure in the country to some extent.
UNHCR and WFP are in the same boat.
I would actually like to echo Mr Lubbers, the High Commissioner of UNHCR who stated that 'in fact, we also need a new coalition which can cope, as it were, with the huge humanitarian tragedy which is unfolding before our eyes' .
I am consciously disassociating myself from tomorrow' s debate on security issues that is much broader still.
I should now like to home in on this particular region, however.
We will need to take action in Iran.
We, together with UNHCR, will also need to take action in Pakistan.
We will need to do this as Europe.
To date, each of our Member States has failed to earmark sufficient funding.
They are dallying and dithering.
The European Union has taken sound initiatives in that respect, for which I should like to praise Commissioner Nielson and the Commission, but now is the time to build this coalition.
For if we are not able to tackle this humanitarian issue jointly, we will be presented with the political bill in due course.
You are dividing the world into two.
You are on your own side but not on ours.
It is not 'them' or 'they' , but it is our joint responsibility to act in that region.
On behalf of the Socialist Group, I hope that the Commission, in close cooperation with all those involved, the international NGOs, UNHCR, WFP, in Iran, in Pakistan, with the political initiatives which Commissioner Patten indicated a moment ago, manages to send out that signal on time: a new coalition for humanitarian aid in the region.
Madam President, Commissioner Patten correctly said that we have no quarrel with Islam.
I say that we have a quarrel with those who abuse Islam and who turn the principles of Islam into weapons against the innocent.
In the same way, we have no quarrel with the Afghan people.
Our quarrel is with bin Laden who shelters in Afghanistan and with the Taliban, they seem to be almost one and the same, and we pity the situation of the Afghan people. They are already one of the poorest nations upon Earth.
Two million Afghan refugees are sheltering in the Islamic Republic of Iran and they have been for some years now.
It is sad to see how little international help has been given to those refugees or to their hosts, the Iranian government.
These refugees fled acute starvation and utter brutality in Afghanistan to find a haven in Iran and there are huge numbers of new refugees now on the move.
The psychological terror that our new alliance has properly caused against terrorism in the region is causing the new flight of so many new millions of refugees.
We must ask ourselves, how we can save lives?
We have always supported NGOs.
We have perhaps given less interinstitutional support.
I plead here to the Commission to look closely at how best to involve our work with that of the United Nations, particularly UNHCR and the World Health Organization, for only the UN, can command the volumes of support that are needed in such a situation, in terms of food, clothing, shelter and the provision of basic needs.
I ask the Commission to assist the refugees who have already fled and are in situ elsewhere.
May I also include the 3.5 million Iraqi refugees in the region.
We must do all we can to help.
Madam President, with regard to the humanitarian dimension of this disaster, I fully concur with Mr Van den Berg.
However, I would like to add one more aspect, which is at the same time a question, a question to the Council, who are not here.
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner a question instead.
A special area of concern when granting aid is the protection of the aid workers.
It is extremely dangerous to grant the necessary aid.
Is the Commission aware of any European countries being prepared to provide those aid workers military back-up?
Next, I should like to turn my attention to the political relationship between the EU and Afghanistan.
What is that relationship not?
Let us be clear about that too.
It does not aim to arm the Northern Alliance.
Neither does it aim to overthrow the Taliban by military force or play the role of Florence Nightingale, caring for the wounded and displaced once the American big brother has smashed everything to smithereens.
So what is - or what should be - the role of the European Union?
Allow me to quote three examples.
Firstly, I believe it would be beneficial if the European Union, as in the past two, three weeks, were to exercise its moderating influence on the United States, so as to prevent any unnecessary civilian victims from being claimed when the Taliban are brought down.
This is an extremely important condition for any broad coalition in future.
Secondly, I strongly urge the United States and Europe not to make the same mistake as we did fifteen years ago, when we supported the mujahedin in the fight against the Russian presence in Afghanistan by filling the country with arms and then walking away.
That is not acceptable.
Mr Joschka Fischer, Germany' s Foreign Affairs Minister, put this across very articulately, in my opinion, when he said that we can no longer afford any black holes on the global map.
Next, I should like to move on to my most important point. In my opinion, any aid, whether it be military, financial, political or economic, now and in future, to the Afghan opposition, whether it be royal or not, should be typified by at least one aspect, namely that this aid should be conditional.
It is not acceptable for Afghanistan to be lumbered with another regime which fails to observe democracy and human rights.
As far as I am concerned, the lesson we should draw from the cold war is, or should be, that not every enemy of our enemy is our friend.
It is friends, in particular, that need to be alerted in an open and critical manner to respecting democracy and human rights.
And that should therefore apply to any aid to any Afghan opposition.
Finally, if the Taliban are fought or overthrown in the name of fighting a strange regime which has been repressing human rights for the past five years, for example where women' s rights are concerned, then that is a fair motivation for this fight in my view, but we then also need to be consistent, and this must also apply to other countries in the region.
It is unacceptable for a country such as Saudi Arabia to escape our attention, because it now forms part of our coalition, for that country too violates human rights and operates an anti-democratic regime.
In my opinion, the real consequences of 11 September can only be drawn if we display the honesty to tackle that country and that region.
Only then will we have a truly justifiable argument against the objection which is currently being heard in that region that our anxiety with regard to Afghanistan would be one of selective indignation.
Madam President, I am able, as it were, to take up where my esteemed fellow MEP, Mr Lagendijk left off.
Who is it we are cooperating with when we wish to strengthen democracy and combat totalitarian regimes, and what is it we are cooperating about?
In the course of the next few days, we shall no doubt become much clearer about what is possible.
We still do not know, of course, how the United States will react.
We still do not know whether the United States will choose to use violent methods and first and foremost seek revenge, or whether we shall in actual fact be given the opportunity to engage in a radical fight against terrorism following the terrible events of 11 September.
With regard, however, to the issue of whom we are to cooperate with, I would urge us to focus upon the very special circumstance that what we have here is a population exposed to violent oppression and that we must be alert to the fact that half of this population is doubly oppressed.
I am talking about the female portion of the population.
I should like to emphasise that there are in actual fact women' s organisations which are still attempting, in Afghanistan too, to fight for women' s rights.
One of these organisations, RAWA, is trying to create the opportunity for both boys and girls to go to school, and we know of course that illiteracy is very high in Afghanistan - 96% in the case of women and 72% in the case of men - so that this is in itself a useful thing to fight for.
They are also attempting to put some documentation together and to do some fact-finding in Afghanistan so that those of us outside the situation have a chance of actually knowing what is going on.
When we find out, it is up to us to use that knowledge, and I should like to call upon us to do just that: to use the knowledge that there are courageous women, committed to democracy, and to cooperate with them in our attempt to eradicate the breeding grounds for terrorism in, for example, Afghanistan.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the response to recent events must be broken down into several different parts, and I will not focus on internal security or military solutions, seeing as I clearly do not have the necessary 'intelligence' , nor will I concentrate on humanitarian responses, for I am sure that the European Union and the international community as a whole will be able to respond generously, effectively and competently, as they have always done in the past.
The problem is not one of humanitarian efficiency or effectiveness, which have been proven for a long time now, but rather of deciding what political response to make to the matter at hand.
I am happy to be able to say this here in this Chamber because Parliament and the European Commission have been the only, rare exceptions among the institutions to pay constant attention to the issue of Afghanistan: in recent years, Parliament has been able to present to the Member States and the Council of Ministers a whole range of political and other suggestions.
We can only lament the fact that we were never heeded and our suggestions never taken up or even considered.
We have been trying to draw attention to the indisputable problem of the tragic violation of human rights for years and, since 1997, the Commission and the European Parliament have also been reiterating that there is a problem of terrorism and drugs in Afghanistan, that is, a major geopolitical problem.
All we can do is lament the indifference shown by the major international institutions.
At the present moment, however, I feel that we have to make a choice: there are moments in history when one has to stop hesitating and take sides, and if we are to do so we must not side with religious fanaticism, dictatorships or some other form of nationalism, but with the liberal democracies - with all their failings and imperfections, admittedly - but also with all their power and their capacity to operate systems which are better equipped to protect human rights in the world.
My concern is the political response.
I fear that it would be a mistake to think that our only enemy is terrorism and, in particular, possibly just Osama Bin Laden.
The issue is much more complex than that: our current enemy is that explosive mixture of authoritarian regimes and dictatorships based on religious fanaticism.
We must make an effort and go deeper into the matter rather than simply believing that if we catch Osama Bin Laden - which would be right and proper and is a legitimate, necessary thing to do - then the problem will be resolved.
A 'holy alliance' to combat terrorism is being formed, made up of a collection of unlikely, not to say dubious allies: there are a number of regimes which are likely to join this alliance, each for its own reasons, each maybe drawing up a list of its own genuine or alleged terrorists with the aim of suppressing its own dissidents, who may well be non-terrorist, democratic individuals.
We must be careful not to put everything under the same umbrella indiscriminately.
I wonder whether it would not make more sense and be more useful to create a world organisation of democracy, of liberal democracy as we know it - and, once again, I do not deny any of its shortcomings - for I feel that this is the institution which we should envisage in the medium term.
Today, when we talk about women or violation or female genital mutilation, we have no organisation to turn to for help.
This is the great challenge before us: to create, export and promote democracy and freedom.
Madam President, the people in Afghanistan, as well as the entire civilised world, stand to benefit from a drastic end to the Taliban regime.
At home, the Taliban keep the country under a reign of mental terror and prefer continuing the civil war to relieving acute famines.
Viewed from outside, their prompt departure from the political stage deserves the highest commendation, because the Taliban export terrorism.
The handiwork of their guest Osama bin Laden is a case in point, as is the fact that they export narcotics on a large scale.
However, Afghan history and today' s political reality prove that the Taliban can only be driven out by internal opposition forces.
That is why we deem the present Afghanistan strategy of the American administration to provide financial and material aid to the broadest possible coalition against the Taliban around the king in exile, Zahir Shah, to be the most plausible foreign contribution to this political and military tour de force.
That is why I call on Europe to lend its unconditional support to this strategy.
We are also delighted by the fact that President Bush has earmarked USD 100 million by way of aid for the immense damage incurred to the Afghan refugees.
May this gesture of compassion with the suffering Afghan people be the first step towards a Marshall plan for this country that has been completely razed to the ground by sustained armed violence.
In that way, the international community can discharge itself from its share of the blame for the present situation in Afghanistan and raise a dam against Muslim terrorism and drugs.
Madam President, Commissioner, as I take the floor in this debate, I would be failing in my duty if I did not pay homage, as you have done Madam President, to the memory of Commander Ahmed Shah Masood.
A number of our Members had the opportunity to meet him here just six months ago, at your invitation, and we discovered that not only was he a man of war famous for his tactics and his exceptional charisma, but he could also be a statesman, and a man of peace and reconciliation, the peace and reconciliation for which his country has been waiting for more than thirty years.
My hope today is that this man, my friend, who said that he was prepared to give his life for the sake of the people of Afghanistan, will not have died for nothing.
Obviously I regret the fact that he was not listened to sooner when he asked for international aid to rid his country of the iron rule of the Taliban, and when he condemned the development of that totalitarian movement of Islamic fundamentalism flaunting its desire for world domination.
What Mr Patten has just told us about the political situation in Afghanistan confirms my analysis that Commander Masood' s plan for solving the crisis in Afghanistan could be well underway.
Now that Pakistan has been obliged to stop giving political and military support to the Taliban regime, that regime should collapse under the pressure of the whole of the Afghan people, as Commander Masood predicted.
I think that proof of this has been provided by the agreement that has just been signed in Rome between the opposition forces and the former King Mohammed Zahir Shah, whose prestige is still as great as ever in his home country.
I also see proof of this in the statements made by Mullah Omar himself, when he announced yesterday that he might possibly be overthrown, and finally in the news that has just reached us about the defection, with seven hundred of his militia men, of the Taliban governor of the Javan region on the border with Turkmenistan, which has brought the province of Badghis under opposition control.
Carried away by the idea of realpolitik, the international community, and with it, I am sorry to say, the European Union, had adopted an attitude towards the Taliban that was at the very least conciliatory, working on the principle that they exercised the real power and that they could not do so without the support of the whole of the Afghan people.
At the time I compared this attitude with the attitude that the Western governments thought they ought to adopt towards the Cambodia of the Khmer Rouge before their abominable barbarism became apparent.
Thanks to that same blind tolerance, we have allowed this hornets' nest of Islamic terror to develop on Afghan territory. Its evil deeds were denounced by Commander Masood, and it must now be destroyed, something which I hope will happen very soon.
However, for the sake of destroying a hornets' next it should not be necessary to burn down the whole house. On the contrary, it is essential that the Afghan people should be spared, and given all the assistance, of whatever kind, that they need in order to establish a stable regime based on national reconciliation.
I have the feeling - and Mr Patten has just reinforced it - that this is the direction in which the Union' s efforts are heading, and I welcome this, but I do not forget the disastrous humanitarian situation that prevails in the region as a whole.
I am thinking of the hundreds of thousands of refugees waiting at the border with Pakistan, and also of the people who for months now have been completely without supplies in the northern provinces.
I know that the Russians have set up an airlift for emergency humanitarian aid, operating from the airport at Dushanbe in Tajikistan.
I would not like to see the European Union conspicuous by its absence in this undertaking, in which its assistance is also desirable.
What these people want is, of course, food, but in addition they want medicines, blankets and shelters, and above all they want us to demonstrate our solidarity.
In Bosnia, at the height of the crisis, Europe, acting within the Atlantic Alliance, was able to set up a scheme for parachuting supplies into the most isolated enclaves, those that were at greatest risk.
This is what the people of Panshir are now expecting.
Have we, and have you, Commissioner Nielson, the will and the means to provide it?
Madam President, I am very much in agreement with the majority of what has been said on this matter and I shall, therefore, not repeat what other speakers have said.
I do think, however, that all of it should be taken into account, given that the whole world is waiting to see the European Union' s reaction.
It seems to me that, given the condemnation of the situation in Afghanistan that this Parliament has already issued, and given the danger of the reduction in civil liberties, we have to remain united, as Commissioner Patten has said, and present a united front against terrorism.
I am also worried, however, by something else that has already been said: the tragic situation that has arisen since these attacks.
On the one hand there is the Afghan population, which is facing a serious crisis, as was very clearly stated by the Joint Committee of the FAO and the World Food Programme (WFP) that recently visited Afghanistan, and which has said that, at this moment in time, the country is suffering widespread starvation due to a serious crisis in agricultural production, that could cause the death of a huge number of people.
To this we must add the continuing danger to the farming population posed by the antipersonnel mines scattered throughout the country and the situation of the thousands of refugees in bordering countries - not only in Pakistan and Iran, but also in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan I would like to point out - that have to be dealt with.
However, what also worries me - and it is on this that I would like to focus, Madam President - is the situation of the populations in all the other developing countries, particularly the African countries, who will suffer the worst economic consequences of this crisis.
According to information from the World Bank, the terror attacks condemn ten million more people to poverty, as a result of economic slowdown and, particularly, from the loss of income due to decreased exports, a reduction in tourism, falling prices, etc.
It is true, Madam President, that the European Union and this Parliament now have to form a strong coalition against terrorism.
But we should also consider - and this would send a signal to the whole world - an international coalition against the poverty, misery and despair of millions of citizens across the world who very often seek protection from the very fanatics who organise these acts of terrorism.
I would, therefore, ask that, alongside this coalition against terrorism, we also send a signal, chiefly to the peoples of Africa and Asia, stating our desire to build a coalition against misery, poverty and despair.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Chairman of the delegation of the European Parliament for relations with Central Asia, I should expressly like to draw your attention to what is happening in countries such as Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.
These countries have been, and will be, the first to be affected by the refugee problem as a result of what is now happening in Afghanistan and in that part of the world.
There is, therefore, an unqualified need for European consultation on the provision of emergency aid, something which Mr Morillon was quite right to point out.
Central Asia is a vulnerable and very fragile region.
It is a vulnerable region economically speaking, in terms of respect for human rights and in terms of the fabric of the civil society and democratic institutions.
It is a region which, for years, has required our support in the fight against fundamentalism and the drugs trade.
That is why we need to ensure that we lend sufficient support to that region.
And what do we do?
In the 2002 budget, we cut back the budgetary resources allocated to that region.
I therefore urge the MEPs of the Committee on Budgets, together with the entire plenary session, to rectify that budget and to give Central Asia what it is entitled to.
This is my urgent plea.
Madam President, we are facing a war against terrorism that all freedom-loving people must embrace.
As you know, I was born in a country that understands terrorism, with 65 000 dead - please remember that the LTT suicide bombers in Sri Lanka are not Muslims - but the world has so far turned a blind eye on twenty-three years of terrorism.
The tragedy of 11 September has finally focused the attention of those that love democracy and freedom on the cancer that hides within. The cancer of terrorism.
A cancer that is fed, not by religion, but by greed, hate, envy and ignorance.
In Afghanistan, the 1963 Constitution as promulgated by King Zahir Shah is an exemplary document.
I salute my colleague, Edward McMillan-Scott, for taking the initiative to lead a delegation to Rome to initiate a coalition between the King and the Northern Alliance, which I am happy to say has now been signed, as General Morillon has just mentioned.
I want to congratulate General Morillon on inviting Shah Masood here, so that in April we had a chance to meet him.

The 1963 Constitution states that liberty is a natural right of each human being - this right has no limitations except the liberty of others, but freedom of thought and expression is invaluable - that every Afghan has a right to print and publish ideas, that education is a right of every Afghan and shall be provided, free of charge, by the State, and that work is a right of every Afghan who has the capability to do it.
What a far cry this is from the tragedy existing in Afghanistan today, where women are beaten, denied education, kept at home as slaves and with one in eight dying in childbirth.
It is a State run by ignorance using the stick of religion, of which they know little, to cower and terrorise their own people.
The war against terrorism is a war to free the people of Afghanistan from the twenty-eight years of slavery.
I salute President Bush and the British Prime Minister for their determination - shoulder-to-shoulder with a Democratic Party and Ian Duncan Smith, the leader of the Conservative Party who was here in Parliament today - to defeat and eradicate international terrorism.
But this must not be a purely Anglo-Saxon affair.
If the EU and this House are to be anything at all, they must have an involvement in ensuring this most basic of human activities; the right to live without being terrorised, the freedom to live without the daily sudden threat of death.
We should not think that we in Europe are not targets.
We already know of plans to attack Genoa, Paris and elsewhere.
When will we learn that is our war too?
Madam President, Commissioner Patten, Commissioner Nielson, I would firstly like to pay tribute to the thousands of innocent victims in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, victims of an attack on our principles, on our democracy, on our system of freedoms, on our way of understanding peaceful coexistence, on our economy, an attack, at the end of the day, on tolerance between peoples and ideas.
The European response has for once been fast and immediate in the case of this Parliament.
The response of the Commission and the Council has also been quick, as Commissioner Patten has just reminded us with regard to the mission by the Troika.
This is a response that should be firm, forceful, proportionate and selective, in cooperation with the United Nations, and which requires political, military and police measures by the intelligence, diplomatic, legal and economic services which have, in one form or another, already been or are in the process of being adopted.
These must be measures that can be adopted and upheld in the short, medium and long term.
I have to remind you that the magnitude and gravity of events is such that the decisions taken here a few days ago that have still not been implemented have already been superseded by events.
I remember several opinions expressed here by various speakers on the occasion of the Watson report on the European Union search and arrest order just three weeks ago.
Mr Massoud, who came to visit us a short while ago, has been assassinated and so will not be able to see to fruition the objectives he spoke to us about here in Parliament.
As a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation I would call for the implementation of a major humanitarian aid programme that must be put in place immediately to help the millions of displaced persons and refugees in Afghanistan, Pakistan and other countries in the region.
The humanitarian disaster that is on the horizon could be of a greater scale than any that has taken place in the past as a result of human barbarity.
I shall conclude, Madam President, by stating that the fight against poverty in the world, that we have highlighted on numerous occasions, is now particularly relevant and that we should make it one of our top priorities if we want to solve this problem in the short, medium and long term.
Madam President, the terrible pictures from New York exactly three weeks ago today have entered our souls to stay.
The speedy declarations of solidarity by Europe and the NATO allies have not been forgotten.
Now that the USA has demonstrated that it is not engaging in cowboy politics, but is giving very serious consideration to every step in the fight against the terrorists, we must not leave it to later to convey our thanks and appreciation across the Atlantic.
But what is being done in comparison?
Take us in Germany as an example: we find fault with the USA and make so bold as to set up rules of conduct.
We are already distancing ourselves from the USA, and an objectionable anti-Americanism occasionally puts in an appearance.
As a German European, I am ashamed of this, bearing in mind also that around 100 Germans were murdered in New York on 11 September.
I can understand why the USA, despite the announcement today that this is an issue for the Alliance as a whole, does not want, if possible, to involve its 19 NATO partners in the military counter-attack against the terrorists and their accomplices, with the exception of Great Britain.
You cannot fight and win a campaign with doubters - and I say that as an officer in the Parachute Reservists.
This is evidence of Europe's incapacity, all the more so as the wrecked twin towers in New York have their counterparts all over the EU.
Afghanistan may well be a target for the USA's counter-attack.
The inhabitants of this country battered over decades are leaving their homeland in droves, eking out an existence in refugee camps in Pakistan.
These people deserve the complete solidarity of the EU and of our Parliament.
Aid from the EU should be unbureaucratic and be given swiftly, bearing in mind that winter is very hard over there.
If we do not help now, it is to be feared that the many young refugees there will be easy prey for one fundamentalist or another.
The European Parliament should consider the advisability of sending a delegation of members of this Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation to Pakistan as soon as possible.
Impressions gained directly from experience are always better than voluminous reports.
Madam President, Afghanistan must be the ultimate example of a tragic and failed State and yet, in spite of this, the will exists for it to remain a unitary State across the ethnic divide.
It has now suffered 28 years of communist dictatorship, followed by fanatic Islamic theocracy, turning it into a pariah State as the Taliban harbours terrorists and executes thousands.
There are over 2 million refugees outside the country and some 5 million internally displaced persons, many of whom may flee if hostilities break out between the US and its allies and Afghanistan itself.
The World Food Programme is hampered by difficult terrain, destroyed infrastructure and Taliban policies which prevent female participation, and which have led to the arbitrary arrest of aid workers on charges of religious proselytising and a ban on communications with the outside world, so essential to an international aid programme.
In spite of this, some 218 tonnes of food got through to Kabul last week to avert a crisis.
It is clear that the West must now think of what can be done post-Taliban to bring permanent stability to the country.
Last week, with two of my fellow MEPs, I was privileged to meet in Rome, the former King of Afghanistan, who has lived in the European Union for much of his life.
We were the first Western elected politicians to visit the royal household since the crisis.
He demonstrated a supreme sense of patriotism and duty to his estranged country, and went as far as to say that he would serve Afghanistan in any capacity his people chose through their assembled tribal council, or Loya Jirga, which he has been working on for the last two years.
He confirmed that he has now received key support from the opposition United Front/Northern Alliance forces and will facilitate an internal settlement appropriate to his country.
He is the only acceptable Afghan figure who can unite all the warring factions and demonstrated the ability, when he ruled his country between 1933 and 1973, to rule constitutionally with tolerance and moderation, even using the English model of sport as a way to unite the disparate ethnic groups.
It was clear to me that Zahir Shah, in spite of his advanced age, was both cogent and fit enough to do the job, after conducting a lengthy one-and-a-half-hour interview with myself and my colleagues.
He has also wisely distanced himself from the restoration of the monarchy as an issue, leaving this to his people to decide.
I urge this House to support the King's mission in this tricky area.
Madam President, I condemn without reservation terrorism and murder.
I agree with my colleagues that there is no reason for it and no-one has a right to carry out such acts.
Terrorists choose violence rather than the ballot box, inflicting death and pain on innocent civilians, justifying their actions by flying the banner of religion, race or political sovereignty.
Islam, like other great world religions, such as Judaism and Christianity, is a way of life for over one thousand million people in this world.
These millions of Muslims, from Indonesia to Nigeria, from Central Asia to the leafy suburbs of California, knew nothing about Osama bin Laden before 11 September.
For these millions and for Islam there is no place for terrorists like him or any others, whoever they are and wherever they come from.
These terrorists have no authority to act on behalf of any people, race or religion.
Therefore, we must fight terrorism and act against terrorists, not innocent civilians who pursue their lives peacefully and who should have the freedom to believe in a religion of their choice.
Human life is precious and the death of innocent civilians, wherever it occurs, is simply not acceptable.
Reason without passion is sterile, passion without reason is heat.
Let us be firm and decisive.
Let us target terrorism: let us remove the causes that conceive, feed and sustain terrorism.
Madam President, the situation was already bad and now it is worse.
I totally agree with what has been said this afternoon on the situation of the people in Afghanistan.
We put Afghanistan on the list of so-called forgotten crises when we fixed ECHO's programme and priorities for 2001.
We had a spending level of some EUR 23 million, which would have covered the continuation until New Year of the very last activity that we were funding there.
In fact we had 29 European NGOs delivering humanitarian aid inside Afghanistan.
They were all there on 11 September.
On 11 September I was on my way to a mission to Afghanistan and to Pakistan.
I was supposed to meet Dr Masood, the Taliban leadership and to go around the whole country seeing the work of these NGOs that we are funding.
I had to cancel the trip.
The morning after, we took the train back from London to Brussels but our luggage was already in the aeroplane for Islamabad.
Now, as I said, the situation is worse.
Winter is approaching.
Winter is such a dominating feature of reality there that even in normal years military fighting more or less stops simply because getting around is so difficult.
So humanitarian aid now faces a really scary challenge.
The international staff of the different aid agencies and NGOs have all been withdrawn from the country.
However, it is very encouraging to see that the local staff is continuing to distribute food - if the food has not been taken over by the Taliban - and is still running health clinics and providing education where it is possible.
Obtaining real, true information is extremely difficult, but we can see that they are trying to keep these activities going even in this situation.
Of course the threat of an outside attack has resulted in large movements of population.
This also has the effect that we cannot rely on people accessing the different storage centres for food as they used to, because they have fled into the countryside in their millions and lost the access to food they had in the cities.
So the internal situation is extremely bad and the people who make it to the border look even weaker than they did before.
Some six million Afghanis are considered to be totally dependent on food supplies from the outside.
If no planting is possible before the winter sets in - and this is most probable - we are in for a very serious threat within less than half a year, even if things work out well in terms of stability.
The very logistics of what is needed down the line, even on the basis of the best case scenario, pose a formidable challenge.
We have supported the different UN organisations very actively, and participated at the meeting of the Afghan support group in Berlin on 27 September.
The UN has launched a UN-donor alert in support of emergency assistance.
The alert calls for some USD 580 million from now until March next year to ensure that delivery of humanitarian assistance and the protection of what is estimated to be around 7.5 million Afghans. USD 120 million is required immediately.
Funding of this appeal would, in fact, seem to be less of a problem than the overall question of accessibility to internally displaced people and refugees.
There are conflicting views in the discussion as to whether emphasis should be placed on keeping the additional migratory flows within Afghanistan or on encouraging Pakistan and Iran to open their borders, as the UNHCR intends to do.
My personal analysis of this is that we are only able to influence the choice of these people to a very small degree.
Things may happen and we will have to be very flexible in order to be able to do what we need to do as things develop.
We have never had to draw up a contingency plan with so few given elements and so many unknowns.
The need to keep food aid going was central to the discussion at this Afghan group meeting.
Everybody agreed on the urgency, but concurred that the prospects for actually delivering such aid were quite poor.
Most participants argued that food-aid distribution without the presence of expatriates could expose Afghan partners to undue risk.
My earlier reference to Afghan local staff continuing to do what they did before the expatriates had to leave relates to deliveries of existing food and other stocks.
It is a far more difficult and demanding task to manage the convoys of new supplies coming in, given the internal situation that exists today.
Things are different in the north-eastern part controlled by the Northern Alliance and in the rest of the country.
But from the humanitarian point of view it is quite evident that our activities must be targeted at the whole country.
That is how it must be.
We are using three financial tools to fund the aid to the Afghan population.
First - and this is to set the record straight - over the past ten years we have provided humanitarian aid of more than EUR 400 million to internally displaced persons in Afghanistan and refugees in neighbouring countries: ECHO funds, drought mitigation and response activities like food aid, agricultural rehabilitation, water and sanitation rehabilitation, assistance to internally displaced persons and to refugees in Pakistan, as well as prevention of displacements and support for returnees.
So this is more than just food aid.
ECHO and the organisations working with our money have managed to build up a portfolio of meaningful activities that they have been able to continue.
I add that one unfortunate international case is not representative of the situation of the 29 organisations that the Commission is funding.
It is a difficult situation but it is important to note that the organisations we are funding cannot be accused of the same kind of activity.
They were able to work with expatriates until 11 September and to build up a portfolio of activity, which I was very much looking forward to coming to see.
I pay tribute also to my predecessor in this job for laying the seeds of this kind of good cooperation with the European humanitarian NGOs.
We have, this year, committed EUR 23 million to ECHO, channelled through NGOs and different UN agencies.
As I said, this would have covered a continuation of this level of activity until the end of the year.
Then this terrible act of terrorism took place.
We reacted immediately with an additional EUR 4 million.
This is committed for action through the World Food Programme, UNHCR, and the International Red Cross.
Now our response has to go beyond this.
We will approach the budgetary authority in order to get the green light for accessing and using funds from the emergency budget reserve, as in earlier years when ECHO's normal budget did not cover the needs that arose because of terrible events.
We announced EUR 25 million a week ago in the Commission.
It will form part of this operation and be directed at the immediate situation of the refugees.
We will be asking for more money.
But this is covered by the normal procedure for accessing additional money.
The second line of support is EC aid to uprooted people.
Here we fund activities creating environments conducive to a sustainable resettlement of returnees and activities aimed at persuading people to remain in their villages.
This budget line will commit funds from October for a budget of EUR 19 million in Afghanistan, EUR 3 million in Pakistan and EUR 2 million in Iran.
Funds are channelled through Afghan NGOs and UN agencies.
The third line is EC food aid and food security.
Since the beginning of this year this line has committed 30 000 tonnes of food aid to the World Food Programme and 7 000 tonnes to NGOs.
A further EUR 7 million is now being requested by the Commission for the WFP Afghan programme.
Let me address some of the questions that have been asked.
Mrs Nicholson mentioned that we should do more through UNHCR and WHO to broaden the broad basis and improve the organisation of this assistance.
In relation also to Mr Van den Berg's remarks, from a commercial management point of view, if you will, the operation in Afghanistan is a good case of cooperation between the UN organisations and those very professional and relatively big and specialised NGOs which, for some years now, have formed part of the operation.
What we need now are operational plans for concrete action.
We hear in the media now about a convoy getting through the Khyber Pass and going north.
This is a 'pilot scheme' , so to speak, which may also progress towards Kabul and on, to try to see what is possible.
But there is no overall plan in place; this was a response to the UNHCR proposals in the discussion with donors for better planning so as to know what to do and not be burdened down with red tape, as Mr Knolle called it.
This is not the problem.
I would go as far as to say that in general this is not the problem with our work in the humanitarian aid area.
Please keep in mind that the totality of ECHO's budget is used every year and this year we are coming to you asking for more because of this situation.
The red tape here is minimal.
Protection was mentioned.
Here we are in a terrible dilemma.
We cannot push those voluntary organisations that work with our money into doing something that goes beyond what they want to do.
On the other hand, we have a problem as a funder, for example if they want to do something very daring that may get them into trouble and we just do what we can on the issue of security, no questions asked.
Chechnya is a case in point; the Russians are still denying our NGOs access to radios, and this is a real problem for the safety of the people there.
This is a balancing act and the responsibility that we have as the funder of the activity goes far into the issue of security.
Again, working with the UN is partly an answer to this, but working to deliver humanitarian aid now to the Taliban-controlled part of Afghanistan under some sort of armed protection is not an option.
There has to be a very open humanitarian mode of operation where suspicion about how one moves around in their country is not a factor.
But this is extremely difficult.
I agree with what Mrs Frahm and Mrs Bonino said about the situation of women.
This is the most extreme version of a denial and violation of human rights apparent to us.
It is part of the conflict that they are in the midst of, and one would hope that sanity emerges after what we are about to go through now.
Mr Belder mentioned the export of drugs.
It should in all objectivity be noted that the Taliban has made an incredible effort to reduce the production of opium and this may be one of the best cases globally that we have seen where they have done what the international community would like to see done.
It reflects a totally different agenda, but has in fact taken place, and so I believed I should mention it.
As regards Mr Morillon's reference to the deceased leader of the Northern Alliance, Ahmed Shah Masood, we have no better answer than the one very well presented by Commissioner Patten as our view of the need for a comprehensive sort of basis for shaping the future of Afghanistan.
This is the line to take.
Mr Morillon also asked me if I had the determination and the means to do what must be done.
We are relying on the international aid organisations to do what needs to be done on the ground.
We have not been hesitant in mobilising funds and are actively participating in the region with the people representing ECHO who are permanently stationed there.
We are participating in the debate on how to organise things and to understand the situation as much as possible.
In response to Mr Staes, consideration for the countries in the Central Asian region bordering Afghanistan to the north will be part of the package I mentioned and we are discussing resources in addition to the EUR 25 million that we have publicly mentioned.
In respect of the dialogue with the budgetary authority, we are not releasing figures other than this EUR 25 million, but this will be an element in that package which we will be coming back to quite soon.
Thank you for your patience.
This is an extremely demanding situation.
I see this as something that demonstrates to us that, looking back on the history of our own experiment in Europe, we got organised to do what needed to be done in Europe after the Second World War and we did it.
The problem we are discussing here today and the challenges it involves tell us that Europe now needs to get organised and find a way of achieving what the world needs to achieve.
Thank you.
The debate is closed.
Guidelines for the trans-European transport network
The next item is the Commission communication on Guidelines for the trans-European transport network.
I now give the floor to Mrs Loyola de Palacio, on behalf of the Commission.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its meeting today, the College of Commissioners adopted a proposed review of the trans-European transport networks, as well as the review of the Financial Regulation, which allows for a doubling of the Community funding in these projects, up to a level of 20% of those projects.
The trans-European transport network has been the backbone of our internal market since it was introduced by the Treaty of Maastricht and, thanks to the guidelines which we jointly adopted in 1996, the European Union has a structure of networks of European interest which allows the interconnection of our regions and aids the mobility of people and goods.
These trans-European networks are Europe' s first attempt since Roman times to treat its infrastructures in a truly global and integrated fashion.
The review we are proposing today attempts to update the development of this system and add new priority projects which respond to the problems of the challenges which our common transport policy has raised in recent years.
The liberalisation of transport systems and the increase in demand for mobility have caused an imbalance between the different modes of transport and have contributed to the creation of bottlenecks in certain areas of our infrastructures.
Both the Gothenburg Summit and the Transport White Paper adopted on 12 September have identified these failings and have demanded that the Commission implement urgent measures to overcome them.
In today' s proposal, the Commission recommends including amongst the priority projects, as well as the so-called Essen projects, eight new rail, combined transport, inland waterways and intelligent transport - specifically the GALILEO project - networks and withdrawing three of the initial projects which have now been completed.
The new projects would be: first, a rail crossing for the Pyrenees which would overcome the natural obstacle which separates the Iberian Peninsula from the rest of the continent.
Second, the high speed train, East-west combined transport, from Paris to Vienna, which will later be extended to Budapest and will complete our network by opening the door to enlargement.
Third, the navigability of the Danube between Straubing and Vilshofen, which will connect the North Sea to the Black Sea, thereby improving the interconnection between the Danube and the Rhine.
Fourth, the GALILEO satellite positioning system, which has been recognised as a priority by successive European Councils and by this House.
Fifth, the road connection between Germany and Denmark via Fehmarn according to the Oresund model, which will improve interconnection between the Nordic countries and the rest of the continent.
Sixth, the high speed rail interoperability of the Iberian network, by adapting it to the track gauge of the rest of the European continent, which will ease sky and land congestion.
Seventh, the extension of the Brenner project from Munich to Verona, as far as Naples, adding the Bologna-Milan line.
Eighth, the extension of the high speed train south as far as Nîmes, which provides a connection between the north and south of Europe.
The necessary global investment for these projects, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, will amount to more than EUR 66 000 million which must clearly be financed essentially through national, regional, private, public and also, where necessary, Community funds.
Geographically, they involve the whole of our territory and they will have a decisive impact on the competitiveness of our economy.
This review also includes in the trans-European networks certain minor technical modifications of existing projects which were left outstanding after the conciliation of the package of guidelines in 1996.
In the Transport White Paper, we committed ourselves to this review, which is the most urgent priority, being followed in 2004 by another which will include in more detail the projects of the new countries of the Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, it would be premature to do so now since, despite the preparatory work, which has made good progress, there is a lack of important information which we will only be able to obtain during the final phase of enlargement.
This Parliament will therefore examine the next review and this is a political commitment which I reconfirm to this House.
Mr President, I am very pleased to fulfil through this work the mandates of the Council and the new requirements of our common transport policy.
Now that the White Paper and the review of the trans-European networks have been presented, I trust and hope, within the framework of codecision, that this Parliament will make its contributions, the added value of which is evident.
Ladies and gentlemen, I know that, while this has been approved today by the Commission, there are currently other topical realities, specifically the consequences for the airline industry of the events of 11 September, which you will possibly be concerned about.
Of course, I will answer any question which you may ask me on this subject.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, thank you for giving us this interim report now.
We are dissatisfied with the Member States, which have practically left you in the lurch over the last eighteen months.
The interim report on trans-European transport networks has been overdue since 1999.
We thank you for presenting it now.
So, to our first question: in your report, you make it clear that you want to add new elements, but that you also want to insist on existing projects which the Member States are still working on - such as the Brenner Tunnel - now at last being finished.
I would therefore ask you how we are together to ensure, even with a possible change to the financial arrangements, that older projects as important as the Brenner Tunnel, but also new ones such as the Franco-Spanish link across the Pyrenees, or the fixed Femarn Belt link between Denmark and Germany actually get built?
Madam Vice-President, you have already alluded to my second question: when are you going to expound to us in committee or in this House what your policy will be on combating new competition in the form of subsidised air travel?
Alternatively, the question arises of how the airlines can be helped after the tragic events of 11 September.
Mr President, I think we can agree wholeheartedly with the Commissioner's main remarks.
I can endorse what Mr Jarzembowski said.
I would, however, like to ask the Commissioner, whether she is able to concur with our view that we can learn from our experiences to date with the Trans-European Networks.
One insight we have gained, for example, is that when the Heads of State and Government decide upon a list, it is not necessarily better than a list of priorities drawn up by Parliament.
Might we perhaps put this experience to use?
In any case, I find the Commissioner's approach in the White Paper, concentrating on rail and waterways, very much worthy of support.
The issue there is whether or not we should check all the financing instruments, not only the money we have for the TEN, with that in mind.
For if it is only in the TEN that priority is given to rail and waterways, then the other funds - for example the Cohesion Fund and others - will have to be looked at and checked with a view to their perhaps taking these new priorities into account as well for the sake of consistency.
Those are my two questions.
Commissioner, a moment ago, you listed a number of projects which will be followed up, for example the high-speed link from Paris-Vienna-Budapest eastwards, and making the Danube navigable.
I wonder whether the latter actually falls within the scope of such a thing as establishing trans-European networks.
I can understand why its repair would come under its scope, in a manner of speaking, for there is already a link there at the moment.
That was my first question.
Secondly, it has become increasingly clear to me that with regard to links within the candidate countries, requests are mainly made for north-south links, and not only for east-west links from Europe and beyond.
My question is therefore whether there are currently any plans to set up more north-south links in the present candidate countries?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your questions.
Firstly, I will reply to Mr Jarzembowski.
It seems to me extremely urgent that we present to Parliament and the Council a new system of charging for infrastructures and, in particular, a modification of the current 'Euro-disc' directive with regard to the funding of road infrastructures.
In this proposed new funding of infrastructures we will undoubtedly consider, amongst other things, that infrastructures should meet not only the costs of their own maintenance or construction, but also the so-called external costs, in accordance with the Costa report which was approved by this Parliament.
We are talking about costs such as congestion, accidents and certain environmental costs, which are clearly definable and quantifiable.
Furthermore, in this proposal we will introduce the possibility that in certain cases - I insist, not as a habitual system, but in certain exceptional cases such as the Brenner tunnel or certain large projects which involve very costly work with a significant environmental impact that must be reduced as far as possible - the so-called Swiss model may be applied in the European Union as well, that is to say that tolls, or part of a toll from an existing infrastructure be used to create a fund to finance the construction of an alternative rail infrastructure.
This is a fundamental issue.
It is by means of these formulae that we hope the most important projects for the structuring of the whole of European territory may be carried out.
Secondly, you are going to analyse the projects that appear here in the codecision procedure.
I wish to say that the fact the project appears in the trans-European networks allows the European Union to promote the idea that States - who in the end have to make the great investments - or regions should also plan their large-scale works not on the basis of national interest, but in the interest of trans-European interconnection and hence with a cross-border vision.
This is why I said that, since Roman times, the trans-European networks initiative is really the first rational proposal of this type.
It will be made possible by providing co-funding, up to a current maximum of 10%.
If the proposals being made here are approved this may go up to 20% for certain particularly important and costly projects, because appearing on these trans-European networks eases access to funding by the European Bank.
Lastly, I will say to Mr Bouwman that, in this new proposal, we incorporate not only the North-south routes, which are the ones that have essentially been included in the other trans-European networks, because they were the most necessary, but also the East-west routes, above all the basic Paris-Stuttgart-Vienna route, which will eventually provide a link with Budapest; we also incorporate the Danube and its best communication with the Rhine, creating a south-east-northeast route which crosses the whole of the Union.
There is no doubt that the 2004 review, when the new countries of the Union will also be integrated, will stress this East-west component even more, without forgetting the North-south, which must always be maintained, in any event.
Exactly, Madam Vice-President, we must not lose sight of the North or of the South. Sometimes, in Spain, we say that we should not lose sight of the North, that is to say we should not lose our way, but, on the other hand, we should neither lose sight of the South.
So that there are no doubts, I will now tell you the order in which you will take the floor.
The first group of three will comprise Mr Ripoll, Mr Izquierdo and Mrs Langenhagen; the second, Mr Varela, Mr Savary and Mr Rübig.
And following the reply of the Vice-President, we shall pass on to another item.
Mr Ripoll therefore has the floor.
Madam Vice-President, I would like to thank you for being here and ask you two very brief and specific questions.
Firstly, could you confirm that the whole of the Spanish high-speed network is included in the trans-European networks?
And secondly, if the answer is yes, what are the scope and consequences of its incorporation for European infrastructure and from a Spanish point of view?
Mr President, Commissioner, the merit of providing information quickly is to achieve an effect of surprise when giving good news.
And I must congratulate you on the news you have brought us today, which was directly related to my first budgetary question, which I now have to adapt.
However, I would like to stress the importance I attach to moving from 10% to 20% in the projects.
My question is, 'how have you done it?' .
Because this action is of interest to us in terms of future actions and requests by this Parliament.
So where did you get that 10% from?
Can the same be expected for other modes of transport?
Secondly, the environmental impact.
When you appeared before us in 1999, at your hearing as a candidate for Commissioner, you said that you would pay very close attention to the environmental impact.
Do you intend to maintain this level of attention in relation to these projects and not be mechanically subject to the will of the States, which normally incorporate truly harmful environmental effects into some of these areas?
Thirdly, we have still not been able to digest the projects which you have just mentioned to us, but I would like to ask you a question with no ill intention, but simply so that we may know your initial opinion: do you think that your proposal tackles the problems of the peripheral regions and is therefore of a cohesive nature?
Mr President, I believe that the terrible experiences in America are causing the European satellite navigation system, GALILEO to be looked at from a new political and economic angle.
The Member States have in the past supported this good initiative of theirs only with reluctance.
Do you believe that there is now a new readiness on the part of the Member States to implement GALILEO without delay?
Mr President, the whole of the European gauge high speed network of the Iberian Peninsula is, in fact, included in the networks.
There is going to be an enormous effort to integrate the Iberian Peninsula with the European rail network and this will bring about such interoperability, thereby making rail transport - for both people and goods - a genuine alternative to other types of transport.
Secondly, what I have just said will clearly serve to integrate the Iberian Peninsula more with the rest of the European Union, just as the Rhine-Rhone project or the Paris-Stuttgart-Linz-Vienna, and, later, Budapest, rail project will serve to integrate the East with the rest of the current European Union.
The same can be said of the link between the Scandinavian Peninsula and the European continent by means of the new alternative connection to the Oresund Bridge, to the Oresund connection, which is also approved in the new plans.
Therefore, Mr Izquierdo Collado, it does serve to integrate the peripheral areas with the centre and, in this respect, it is cohesive.
As for the aforementioned 10% and 20% thresholds, these are financing possibilities.
It does not mean that 10% or 20% will be granted.
There are times when 5% is granted and is the maximum limit.
Second issue. We will have to see whether the Council and Parliament support it.
Third issue. It works for all modes of transport, because these trans-European networks do not only include the elements I have indicated.
Generically, there is the interconnection between ports and their adjacent land area, that is, rail interconnections, land interconnections, the intermodal interconnection not only of the sea ports but also of river ports, the modal interconnections between rail and airport, for interconnection with the air sector, and the interconnection between rail and road, essentially in the freight sector.
In other words, there is another series of generic elements that I have not expanded upon, which are also included in these networks.
In particular, we have to solve the problem of bottlenecks.
In the case of bottlenecks, with much less action in terms of budget, we can achieve multiplier effects.
Ten per cent of the road network and 20% of the rail network is affected by habitual bottlenecks.
This does not mean that 20% of the rail network is a bottleneck.
But there are problem points within this rail network that eventually effect 20% of the European rail network.
Of course, we will try to ensure that funding is at the maximum level in these cases.
In relation to environmental impact, I maintain what has been said before.
We have prepared all of this in common agreement with the department of Mrs Wallström and with the Commission' s Directorate-General for the Environment and we have agreed that we will continue to work jointly on its implementation and promotion.
Mrs Langenhagen, we are going to hold a debate in relation to GALILEO.
Ladies and gentlemen, you are aware of my personal interest in this project, which I believe to be crucial in terms of European Union strategy.
In my personal opinion - although it is shared by the Services and by the Commission as a whole - what happened on 11 September gives us all the more reason to move ahead with this project.
Clearly, not all of the applications that increasingly depend on the American global positioning system can rely on a single system.
We need a second system that will complement and strengthen the current system, which is the American one.
It is not a question of competing with the Americans. It is a question of participating, together with the Americans, in order to make the whole system more secure.
In any event, you know that Council will have to give its definitive opinion on these issues at its last meeting in December and I hope that on that occasion we will finally clear up any ambiguities and doubts once and for all and we will move ahead with a project which is essential to the future of the European Union.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and congratulate her on having appeared so quickly before this House to give us this important information today.
Although she gave a general reply earlier in relation to Spain, I would like, if you will permit me, to ask about a specific aspect which has a lot to do with peripheral regions, or rather the most peripheral of the peripheral regions - the Galician Finisterre.
I would like to ask you whether these new guidelines approved by the Commission, in relation to Spain and the high speed railway, include connections with the Autonomous Community of Galicia and, if so, whether you can explain how.
Thank you, Commissioner, for this new information on the trans-European networks.
I should like to mention one issue, and at the same time take the opportunity to say that I welcome the fact that it has been included, and that is the crossing of the Pyrenees.
It is an issue that has received much less media attention than the Alps, but it is probably a more critical one.
Even now, the number of heavyweight vehicles which cross the Pyrenees every day between the Iberian peninsula and France is greater than the number crossing the Alps.
We shall therefore be faced with the development of a very critical situation, because infrastructures on the Atlantic side are lagging behind.
As for the actual crossing, or central railway tunnel, I believe that this is a very good thing, but we must not forget that this tunnel will certainly not be constructed in the short term, since the Lyon-Turin tunnel and the Brenner tunnel have to be built first.
I would like to make a personal plea - and I would like to hear your opinions on the subject - for emergency structures at either end of the Pyrenees, particular between the Basque Country and the Atlantic coast.
It seems to me that it is there, first of all, because that is where the people and the activities are, that we shall free the bottleneck in the road and rail routes leading to the Iberian peninsula.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, thank you for your initiative.
The citizens want enlargement to build visible bridges.
The Slovak government seeks a bridge in the form of the joining of Vienna and Bratislava airports into a mega-airport with a 'Transrapid' rail line to improve transport links.
This could well be the first stage of the Paris-Vienna route you have mentioned.
I believe it would be a very important initiative to take it onward as far as Budapest.
We also have, however, the shipping junction on the Danube, and in the long run this would become a triple junction.
Do you think this programme could also facilitate the financing of junctions of this sort?
Mr President, many thanks to Mr Varela.
If we are talking about the Galician stretches of the high speed network, yes, they are included, as are the interconnections with Portugal, insofar as, I insist, it involves adapting and modifying these constructions in accordance with the European gauge, whether they be new lines or adaptations of existing lines, and I should like to make this clear.
Furthermore, there is another series of projects which affect that part of Europe, such as issues relating to ports and other issues that I will not go into now.
Mr Savary, I fully share your concern about the Pyrenees.
When, as the person responsible for transport in the European Union, I look at a map to see what is happening, I see a barrier, a wall, with a pass on the right of the map, on the far eastern side, and another on the left, in the west, and in between there is nothing.
There is no railway.
It now seems that there is going to be a pass at Canfranc but, for the moment, there are just those two passes.
The Commission believes that, between now and 2010, we must provide a pass for a further 100 million tonnes between the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of the European continent.
We must now begin to discuss, prepare and work on a rail project that will create a great Pyrenean pass, not at the western or eastern extremes, but at the most central part; that will go further than the contribution of the possible creation of the Canfranc pass; that will create a truly significant rail route for goods.
We are talking about high figures.
As you say, undoubtedly both the Spanish and the French governments will have to consider alternatives, because for that great central Pyrenean pass we are talking in terms of around 2015 to 2020, that is, in 15-20 years time, and this type of project has to be planned that far in advance and they have to be dealt with and initiated within that timescale.
Apart from that, in any event, one of the Essen projects is still under way, which included the Basque 'Y' , which also involves a European gauge link via that entrance to the Iberian Peninsula.
I would like to say to Mr Rübig that the Vienna-Bratislava motorway is included in the projects (I have not mentioned it because it is a lesser issue), which includes the stretch of that motorway within Austrian territory.
A rail interconnection is not envisaged at the moment, but I would like to say that all of these aspects will clearly have to be looked at with care for the 2004 review, when enlargement has taken place, at least its first stage, if there are to be more stages.
Thank you very much, Madam Vice-President.
That concludes this item on the agenda.
Question Time (Commission)
The next item is Questions to the Commission (B5-0333/2001).
We are not going to have an hour and a half. We are going to have an hour and a quarter at the most.
I would therefore ask Members to cooperate so that we can get through as many questions as possible.
Mr Vitorino represents the Commission.
Part I
Question No 27 by (H-0700/01):
Subject: Illegal immigration into the European Union through Morocco What measures will the Commission propose in order to regulate illegal immigration through Morocco, with a view to preventing any recurrence of the kind of tragic events which occurred this summer in Community waters?
I am grateful for your explanations, but I wanted to stress the urgency of the issue.
Specifically, this summer thirty or forty people, that we know of, have drowned as a result of the operation of these illegal immigration networks.
It is calculated that last year four or five thousand people drowned trying to cross the stretch which separates Morocco from Spain.
I would therefore like to repeat the question, Commissioner, of whether there is any possibility that, without waiting for the result of the Barcelona process and the broader renegotiations on association, we can reach a very practical agreement in terms of policing and control so that the Moroccan authorities may prevent these deaths, which are reaching frightening proportions.
Mr President, I fully agree with Mr Medina' s belief that we are facing a human tragedy, that we cannot expect an ideal solution and that we will have to discover the solution as we progress.
In order to progress, however, the two sides must agree on the mechanisms to be applied.
This is something which is yet to reach a point which I consider acceptable.
We therefore have great hopes that at the Association Council next week progress can be made on the identification of specific cooperation mechanisms, including police cooperation on border control.
In any event, I would like to stress that in 2001 a very substantial proportion of the budgetary line which I mentioned has been dedicated to actions for cooperation with Morocco, increasing that country' s administrative capacity in the management of illegal immigration, which is not just a human problem: it is a political problem, especially for Spain.
But it is also a problem for Morocco, because Morocco is today a transit country in which there are many sub-Saharan illegal immigrants, with very harmful social consequences for Morocco.
I believe that after next week we will have better cooperation perspectives, which I hope will be the result of the meeting of the Association Council.
Question No 28 by (H-0730/01):
Subject: Release of Mr Albin Kurti and other Kosovars still being held hostage by the Belgrade authorities Of some 2000 Kosovars who were kidnapped and held hostage by the military and paramilitary forces belonging to the regime then in place in Belgrade in the days leading up to the international police operation in Kosovo more than 28 months ago, 229 are still being held in Serb prisons.
One hundred of them are being held for common law offences, while the remaining 129, including the student leader Arbin Kurti, are being held for their convictions or for 'political' offences.
In February 2001 the Serb and Yugoslav parliaments passed an amnesty law allowing the release of 30 000 Serbs and some 400 Kosovars.
At the end of April 2001, 143 prisoners were released from Jakova prison.
The Serb judicial authorities had stated that the cases of the remaining Kosovar prisoners would be the subject of a rapid judicial review followed by release.
Despite these commitments given by the Belgrade authorities, however, and despite the Council and Commission's repeated promises to intervene forcefully in order to put an end to this intolerable situation, the matter has still not been resolved.
Has the Commission decided no longer to consider it a priority to resolve this issue?
If not, what initiatives will it take in order finally to bring about the immediate release of Arbin Kurti and the 129 Kosovar hostages and the transfer of the 100 Kosovar prisoners still being held in Serbia for common law offences to the UNMNIK, which is the only competent body in this connection?
The European Commission remains concerned by this issue and I can assure the honourable Member that we are taking every available opportunity to exert appropriate pressure on those in a position to take decisions on this issue.
As the honourable Member recognises, considerable progress has already been made and we welcome this.
The remaining prisoners' cases are being reviewed and where convictions cannot be supported by evidence the prisoners are released.
Where there are grounds for conviction, appeals are being launched.
The ICRC monitors the condition of individual prisoners and maintains contact with their families.
As regards the transfers of prisoners from detention in Serbia to the United Nations' Mission's facilities in Kosovo, this matter is being discussed by the appropriate authorities.
Simultaneous reform of the judiciary with the help and advice of international organisations, such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE, which are now both present in Belgrade, is under way.
The rule of law and respect for minority rights are key conditions applying to relations with and assistance for the Former Republic of Yugoslavia and its neighbours.
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you.
Having said that, however, I should point out a certain number of things.
On numerous occasions, your colleagues at the Commission have talked about priority with regard to the transferring of the Kosovar hostages from Serbia to Kosovo.
They did so when the criminal Milosevic was still in power.
That was almost a year ago, and there has been a change of regime in Belgrade, so it is even more incomprehensible that these problems have still not been solved.
You talk about grounds for conviction, you talk about appeal procedures, but it has been established and confirmed, by this Parliament itself, that the Belgrade authorities were not competent, that only UNMIK was competent to deal with these cases, that the transfer had therefore already been accomplished, in law, and it was simply a matter of implementing it, and that has been the case for the past two years, Commissioner.
Well, that is quite a long time for us, but I think it is an extremely long time for those who are still incarcerated in the gaols of Belgrade.
In the case of Mr Arbin Kurti in particular, who was a student leader, I really do not understand what objections or other factors can still be preventing his transfer.
. (FR) On specific cases, I would say that direct responsibility for monitoring trials lies with the ICRC.
The Commission raises the question from a general political viewpoint, and I can assure the honourable Member that when speaking to the authorities of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia we have always urged the need for decisions to be taken as quickly as possible.
I must emphasise that there are some cases in which crimes have been committed.
In those cases, it is up to the law to decide what should be the fate of the accused, to charge them and to launch appeals so that justice will prevail in the end.
As far as political relations are concerned, I can assure the honourable Member that we have never ceased to urge a rapid resolution of all the situations that are being assessed, and I must point out that some progress has been made, but of course, any period of time is too long when one has been charged with an offence, especially when the charge is unjust, and the Commission, for its part, will continue to urge as rapid a solution as possible in those situations which are still being assessed.
Question 29 by (H-0737/01):
Subject: Trials in Kabul The trial began in early September before an Islamic court in Kabul, Afghanistan, of four citizens of a Member State of the Union, Germany, together with two US and two Australian citizens, all of whom are aid workers with Shelter Now International.
In accordance with the Islamic law of the country, the prosecutor is demanding the death penalty for conducting Christian missionary activities.
At the same time, 16 Afghan citizens have been charged with converting from Islam to the Christian faith, for which the prosecutor is also demanding the death penalty in accordance with the Islamic law of Afghanistan.
What representations has the European Union made to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to secure respect for the legal rights of all the accused and their protection in the context of the European Union's endeavours to promote religious freedom as an integral part of human rights, as enshrined in the UN Charter, the Council of Europe Convention and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the German government has specifically requested that the European Union should neither adopt positions nor take action in relation to the eight humanitarian aid organisation workers, specifically from the 'Shelter Now International' non-governmental organisation, who are currently on trial in Kabul, in Afghanistan, accused of attempting to convert Afghan Muslims to the Christian religion.
The governments of the three countries whose nationals are involved in this situation, Germany, Australia and the United States of America, have decided to act jointly at this stage and have stated that they would prefer to find solutions to this problem on a strictly bilateral level.
The honourable Member will be aware that the trial of these eight people is under way.
Given the current situation and climate, the Commission does not consider it to be appropriate, or even helpful, to make any further comment on this situation, since the decision must fall to the governments of the nationals involved.
I can assure you, however, that both the Commission and all of the European Union' s Member States will, of course, continue to follow developments carefully and closely.
Thank you for your answer.
Mr Vitorino' s reply made no mention of the sixteen Afghans brought before the courts and accused of having converted from Islam to Christianity. These people are threatened with the death penalty under Islamic law.
My question to Mr Vitorino is: have we in the European Union, in our fight against the death penalty and in support of religious freedom, in any way acted on behalf of these people who are in actual fact threatened by the death penalty?
In what way is the European Union taking action against all those Arab and Muslim countries - in practice, almost all of them - in which converting from Islam to Christianity is in actual fact punishable by death?
Irrespective of what happened in the United States on 11 September, we must be tireless in our campaign against the death penalty.
My question is: What has happened to these sixteen Afghans who are in danger?
Mr President, I do not think that the honourable Member can doubt my position or that of the Commission on the death penalty or on freedom of religion.
If he had the opportunity to hear what I said, for example, in the debates on the European Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights, he will find the answer there, not only in rhetoric, but also in clear and unequivocal laws.
I admit that we do not have any specific information on the situation of the sixteen Afghans to whom he refers.
Apparently, however, these sixteen Afghans will be committed to trial at a later date, in other words, not at the same time that the eight citizens of Germany, the United States and Australia are to be tried.
We support, of course, the statement by the troika, the 'Afghan Support Group' , a joint contact group, currently chaired by Germany which has issued an unequivocal statement of support for these non-governmental organisation workers, whether they be citizens of the States I have mentioned or Afghans caught up in this situation.
Thank you very much for your presence and participation in this Question Time, Mr Vitorino.
We will move on to the second part.
We have twenty minutes per Commissioner, not a minute more.
A very good afternoon, Mr Bolkestein.
Part II
Questions to Commissioner Bolkestein
Question No 30 by (H-0707/01):
Subject: Community trade mark courts When is action going to be taken against Member States which have not set up courts and tribunals to deal with matters relating to the Community trade mark?
Mr President, since the honourable Member, Mr Berenguer Fuster, raised a similar question last December, the Commission has addressed a letter of formal notice to Spain, France, Luxembourg, Italy and Greece in which it recalled the need to fulfil obligations regarding the designation of Community Trade mark courts.
The Greek authorities have informed the Commission that the relevant regulation, which designates the courts of justice for Community Trade marks, was approved in September.
France has stated that a decree on this matter will be approved before 31 October 2001.
The Commission services are currently checking this information.
As regards the three remaining Member States, Spain, Luxembourg and Italy, the Commission does not yet have any information proving that these Member States have adopted the necessary provisions.
The Commission is, therefore, considering launching infringement proceedings for failure to comply with Community law according to Article 226 of the EC Treaty.
Thank you for your information, Commissioner.
I am obviously referring to the case of Spain, since I clearly do not have sufficient knowledge of the cases of Italy and Luxembourg.
On 13 December 2000 the Commissioner responded to me in saying that, in the case where there was no satisfactory response, the Commission would open an infringement procedure in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty.
Today you have told us that the Commission has no news of these three countries including Spain which, to make matters worse, is the location of the headquarters of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, having begun any procedure to create what they committed themselves to, and that they have been non-compliant since November 1996.
If this is the case, if it was already taking place a year ago, if there has been no satisfactory response for almost a year, why is the Commission waiting to begin the infringement procedure?
I can well imagine the impatience, or shall I say irritation, of Mr Berenguer Fuster with the fact that the government of his country has not yet taken the desired steps in order to set up this court.
Indeed, it is true that this is an infringement.
May I point out that the Commission does not hesitate to pursue infringement proceedings, but only, as the Latin expression goes, as an ultimum remedium; in other words, only when all the avenues and possibilities of settling matters in an amicable way have been exhausted does the Commission take that step.
I take Mr Berenguer Fuster's point that his own patience, like that of the Commission, is close to being exhausted.
We shall indeed do what he proposes, and what the Commission is also intending to do.
Let us make a last effort to convince the Spanish government - particularly in view of the upcoming presidency, when it would not do if the Commission were to open such proceedings - to do so now before the Commission takes that ultimate step.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 31 and 32 will be taken together.
Question No 31 by (H-0728/01):
Subject: Letter of notification concerning implementation of Directive 89/48/EEC in Greece In reply to my question E-1336/01 on the recognition of diplomas under Directive 89/48/EEC in Greece, the Commissioner responsible, Mr Bolkestein, stated, among other things that 'A Commission decision on the matter is expected in the coming months, and in any case in autumn, following some supplementary details that may need to be checked with the Greek authorities.'
In fact, the press reported on 9 August 2001 that the Commission had sent a letter of notification to Greece which identified a problem with the Presidential Decree transposing Directive 89/48/EEC into Greek law.
What are the legal arguments on which the Commission bases its view that the failure to recognise diplomas awarded by educational establishments of another Member State under 'franchise' agreements in Greece is contrary to the Community Directive, and on which points is the Presidential Decree transposing Directive 89/48/EEC in Greece inconsistent with that Directive?
Has the Greek government answered the points set out in the letter of notification or are there any indications as to what its legal arguments might be?
Question No 32 by (H-0750/01):
Subject: Implementation of Directive 89/48/EEC in Greece The Court of Justice of the European Communities has ruled against Greece for its failure to implement Community Directive 89/48/EEC on a general system for the recognition of higher-education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of at least three years' duration.
Will the Commission say whether Greece has complied with the judgment of the Court and, if not, what steps it intends to take to bring Greek law into line with Community legislation?
Mr President, in reply to the Oral Question by Mr Alavanos, the letter of formal notice sent to Greece to which the honourable Member refers, concerns a recently initiated infringement procedure regarding the failure of Presidential Decree No 165 of 23 June 2000 to comply with Directive 89/48 in certain areas.
On the other hand, the procedure referred to in question E-1336/01 earlier more specifically concerns problems surrounding the misapplication of Directive 89/48 to the psychology profession.
The Commission considers that diplomas awarded in Greece by another Member State and the refranchising agreements do not relate to training provided from or by Greece, but to training provided from or by the other Member State, since the Greek establishment in which the training in question has been provided is merely an intermediary without any autonomy.
In other words, it is not the Greek establishment that awards diplomas, but rather the university in the other Member State, and consequently, if those diplomas relate to professional training within the meaning of Directive 89/48, they are covered by that Directive.
The purpose of the letter of formal notice is to obtain the Member State's observations on specific questions.
Greece has not yet replied to that letter of formal notice and, therefore, no firm grounds for infringement procedings have been established as yet.
Consequently, the Commission is not able to reply to that part of the question from the honourable Member.
Given the similarity of the subject matter, I shall now continue, if I may, by answering the question by Mr Hatzidakis.
In the judgment to which the honourable Member refers, the Court of Justice of the European Communities condemned Greece for its failure to communicate measures taken to implement Directive 89/48 - the Directive I referred to in my reply to the previous question.
The Commission thus initiated a new infringement procedure against Greece with a request for the fixing of penalty payments.
This second procedure was closed when Greece complied.
It complied with the Court's judgment by forwarding Presidential Decree No 165 of 23 June 2000 to the Commission.
As I pointed out in my reply to the previous Oral Question put by Mr Alavanos, the Commission considers that certain provisions of Directive 89/48 have not been implemented correctly.
The Commission has also received complaints from individuals who, even since the implementation of the directive, have not seen their rights respected.
The Commission has, therefore, initiated a new infringement procedure, this time for incorrect implementation and application of the directive, and the letter of formal notice to which I referred just now has been sent to Greece.
We expect to receive the observations of the Greek authorities very soon.
A specific procedure for recognition of the psychology profession is currently being introduced, and that profession, together with a number of others, has been the subject of specific implementing legislation on problems concerning the application of Directive 89/48 that have also been drawn to the Commission's attention in that context.
That is my reply to the question put by Mr Hatzidakis.
I should like to make a point of thanking the Commissioner for what was a very detailed reply, including from the technical point of view.
All that remains to be seen is what the government's response will be to the Commission's move.
As the Commissioner knows, I have raised this matter on numerous occasions, I should just like to inform him that the Minister of Education's public response is that I am asking the wrong questions of the wrong Commissioner and obtaining the wrong replies.
So now I am waiting to see what the Greek government's response will be.
However, my question to the Commissioner is this: why confine ourselves solely to the psychology profession and, more to the point, to psychologists who have graduated from French universities when numerous complaints have been lodged with the Commission by other disciplines and by students studying in other faculties and graduating from foreign universities, even though they have taken part of their course in Greece?
I can assure Mr Alavanos that the Commission has looked at this whole issue in the broadest possible sense and has not confined itself to the matter of psychologists.
The basic issue is the question of whether a degree awarded by another Member State, following a course of studies which takes place physically in Greece, is or is not assimilated to a similar degree issued in Greece itself following studies at a Greek university.
So it is the equivalence between a purely Greek degree and a degree awarded by a university of another Member State, but where the study has been undertaken at a Greek establishment.
That assimilation, that equality is the purpose of Directive 89/48, to which I have referred at various times this afternoon.
The Commission is taking that into consideration and has asked Greece to explain why that directive has not been transposed and applied accordingly.
The directive does not confine itself to psychologists and, to that extent, I can assure Mr Alavanos that his fears are unfounded.
Commissioner, as I am sure you are aware, the question at issue is not a question which just concerns a few citizens in Greece, it concerns thousands of graduates from European universities whom the Greek State sends abroad to study, because we have what to me is a crazy educational system, and then refuses to recognise their qualifications.
This question in fact concerns several thousand young people who are denied a career because of the mindset of the Greek State.
This being the case, I should like to say that I welcome your finding that the Court's judgment is not being applied properly and, because the Greek public is listening to what we have to say, to ask you: if the Greek government continues to take this view, what are the legal implications?
What will the Commission's next move be?
Just so that our citizens know where they stand.
I am very conscious of the fact that the number of young people involved is large.
I must confess I have not counted them, but if Mr Hatzidakis says that thousands of young people are affected, then I am certain he is right.
That underlines the importance of this issue.
Whether the educational system is absurd is a qualification I must leave for Mr Hatzidakis.
I am sure he has political friends in his country who can raise this matter in the national parliament of Greece.
But we are in the European Parliament.
It is quite right that Mr Hatzidakis draws our attention to this untoward state of affairs and I thank him for his contribution to our debate.
As regards the legal instruments, as I said earlier in my reply to Mr Alavanos, the Commission will use all the legal instruments at its disposal.
The Commission has no particular desire to take Member States to court but if European law is not respected then it has no alternative.
Therefore I say to both Mr Hatzidakis and Mr Alavanos that, if the Greek government does not apply the rules correctly, as should be the case, the Commission will, in a well-considered and very deliberate manner, make use of the instruments it has and start legal proceedings.
Mr President, my answer is as follows.
The Commission is currently considering initiating a procedure against Finland under Article 226 of the Treaty, which will supplement the one initiated in 1998.
This case will be dealt with at a Commission meeting in the near future.
The new procedure is also likely to cover problems in implementing Directive 83/183, which deals with the tax exemptions granted when people move house.
At the same time, Commission staff have written to all Member States, drawing their attention to the judgment by the Court of Justice to which Mr Vatanen' s question refers, namely the Gomez-Valente Judgment of 22 February 2001, and the Commission shares the honourable Member' s opinion that the judgment in question will have implications outside the context of the dispute in question, and will open up the way to second-hand vehicles being treated in a manner which is more in line with the requirements of the European internal market.
However, the Commission wishes to point out that the procedure intended to ensure that the above-mentioned judgment is complied with must remain independent of any other procedure which it has initiated or is intending to initiate.
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your efforts.
I feel reassured to hear your answer and I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission officials for their work.
Commission officials have admitted that Finland is blatantly violating Community and single-market rules.
The Finns are desperately waiting for those EU rights that they are entitled to and which they were promised.
Mr Commissioner, I hope you do not find this too heavy, but their hopes are lying on your shoulders.
We know we can count on you.
First of all I should like to thank Mr Vatanen for his very kind remarks.
I feel the weight of all those motorists in Finland on my shoulders - a very heavy load indeed.
One complicating factor is that this is an area which has not yet been harmonised in the European Union.
The Commission's legal basis for its actions is Article 90 of the Treaty on the one hand, which prohibits tax discrimination, and on the other hand two directives adopted in 1983.
Article 90 gives the Court of Justice the opportunity for abundant jurisprudence.
Since interpretations of the judgments of the Court are not always unanimous, it is time to create a synthesis of all the various interpretations in order to determine clearly our future action.
That need for a synthesis is one of the reasons that led me to include in the Commission's working programme for this year a communication on motor vehicle taxation.
It is my intention that this communication, which I hope will appear around the end of this year or the beginning of next year, will cover all the problems in connection with vehicle taxation and vehicle pricing, so that we can take a broader approach to them and settle the problem in Finland to which Mr Vatanen has referred.
I hope that will be to his satisfaction.
Thank you very much for your great cooperation with Parliament, Mr Bolkestein.
Question No 34 by Mrs Anne E.M. Van Lancker (H-0765/01) will not be replied to since it is included in the agenda of this part-session.
Question No 35 by (H-0695/01):
Subject: Law on the use of minority languages in Slovakia From an official position paper of the Foreign Ministry of the Slovak Republic, sent to us by the Slovak ambassador in Brussels, we understand that the law of 1999 on the use of minority languages in Slovakia gives minorities certain rights.
When 20% or more of the inhabitants of a village speak another language, they can receive official communications in their own language.
We have personal experience of how this law operates in practice.
In villages where more than 20% of the population is made up Slovaks, the inhabitants can receive all official communications in Slovakian.
The law thus appears to work satisfactorily.
However, when it transpires that in the same village 75% of the population is Hungarian and they can obtain official documents concerning births, marriages and deaths only in Slovakian and the mayor of the village may not speak Hungarian during public or official functions, then we must have serious doubts about the implementation of a language law which appears satisfactory on paper.
In connection with Slovakia's accession to the EU, is the Commission investigating whether the law is being implemented, how this is being done and what progress is being made?
Mr President, the Commission is paying very careful attention to the use of minority languages in Slovakia.
It takes the view that Slovakia has made considerable progress in developing a positive policy on minorities and in drawing up the necessary legislation whilst putting in place and supporting the relevant institutions.
The enacting of the law on the use of minority languages for official business was, in this regard, an important step.
It brought domestic law into line with current international standards and complied with the specific recommendations of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the Commission.
A further important step was the ratification of the European Charter on regional or minority languages.
It should be noted in particular that Slovakia desires to concede the greatest possible freedom to the Hungarian minority in accordance with the flexibility that the Charter makes possible.
The Commission nevertheless observes that considerable efforts are still required for the practical enforcement of all the existing legislation.
In some areas, minorities do not avail themselves of the rights guaranteed them by the law on the use of minority languages for official business, above all, it seems, through ignorance of them.
This seems to be the case above all in communities with a large proportion of Roma among the population.
The Commission will continue in future to urge Slovakia to continue its efforts to implement the provisions of its laws, improve policy in this area and make the necessary budget funds available.
The observations which you, Mrs Maes, have made in person come as no surprise to me.
They prove only that the difficulties with implementation, which I have described, continue to prevail.
We will be discussing this topic further in the next progress report on Slovakia, which is due to appear in November.
I think you are right, some sections of the population will not be fully aware of the existence of new legal provisions.
But we must still ask ourselves whether there is always the necessary goodwill present in order to allow citizens to translate the legal provisions into practice.
From that point of view, it would probably be useful if we did not only draw the attention to the very sensitive nature of the subject matter in the reports but also in the contacts with the Slovak authorities.
In our opinion, a verdict on the minority policy cannot be a verdict on what has been set down on paper. It should also concern rights and facts.
I cannot but agree, Mrs Maes, with what you have said, and can confirm that we address this issue in all our contacts with the Slovak government.
I have, myself, done so repeatedly in conversations with the head of the Slovak government and with the Slovak parliament and press and also on public occasions in Slovakia.
The message we are communicating in Slovakia is that we see the way the numerically stronger Slovaks interact with their minorities as an indicator of how strongly democracy and the rule of law have developed in that country.
Question No 36 by , which has been taken over by Mr Miller (H-0714/01):
Subject: Ignalina nuclear power station, Lithuania What is the Commission's current position with regard to the closure of reactor two of the Ignalina nuclear power station in Lithuania?
Mr President, Mr Miller, the Commission's view on this issue is at one with that of the Council and - in so far as I can judge - with that of the European Parliament.
The Lithuanian Parliament adopted a national energy strategy in 1999.
As part of this, it has decided that Block 1 of the Ignalina nuclear power plant is to be decommissioned by 2005 and that the final decision on the decommissioning date for Block 2 will be taken in 2004 in the context of the national energy strategy review.
The Commission stated at the time that it understood that Block 2 had to be shut down by 2009.
This is a matter of logic: if 2005 is the latest date for Block 1 to be shut down, it follows from the envisaged lifetime of the two nuclear power installation units that 2009 is the latest date for the decommissioning of Block 2.
As regards Block 1, the Commission took it into account that Lithuania had commenced extensive preparations for decommissioning and shutting down.
I am working on the assumption that the decommissioning is actually to take place before 2005.
As far as Block 2 is concerned, the Commission has stated - as I have already said - that the decommissioning is to take place by 2009 at the latest.
Over and above that, the Commission and the Member States believe that the timetable for the decision on decommissioning should be compatible with the timetable for Lithuania's accession to the European Union.
I spoke about this in depth only a few days ago with the new Lithuanian government in Vilna - it was actually the main topic of conversation in Vilnius - and I got the impression that the Lithuanian parliament and government had well understood the message that they now have to think about how the timetable for the decisions about Ignalina Block 2 has to be revised with a view to their own timetable for joining the European Union.
Let me take this opportunity to point out that it is precisely with regard to Ignalina that the Commission views compromises as impossible.
Ignalina is a nuclear power plant of the same type as Chernobyl, one that experts are generally convinced is not retrofittable and cannot be brought up to acceptable safety standards.
It is our firm conviction that this Chernobyl-type nuclear power plant is a source of real danger to human beings, and we will therefore be unable to withdraw our demand.
I thank the Commissioner for his answer.
I especially liked what he said about there being no room for compromises.
Is the EU position absolutely fixed, with no likelihood of it being altered in the near future?
I should also like to raise the point about international funding for decommissioning.
Is that to come from the Commission's own budget?
What happens if there is insufficient money for that decommissioning?
Mr Miller, I can answer your first question with a definite 'no' , which seems to be what you desire.
The European Union's stance on this issue will not change.
The situation as regards the second question is as follows: an international fund for the decommissioning of Block 1 of the plant was created. The fund is managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and, to date, EUR 220 million have been made available for it.
These EUR 220 million I mentioned were the result of an international conference of donors which I convened jointly with the Lithuanian Prime Minister last year in Vilnius.
I must however add - and this clouds the picture a little - that EUR 165 million of this sum comes from our own budget, so that the amount that the international community was prepared to raise in addition looks modest in comparison.
Nonetheless, the funds available suffice to start on the shutting-down process as planned and to finance all the tasks connected with it.
I must draw it to your attention that the shutdown of such a nuclear power plant is a project lasting decades and the financial obligations resulting from it for us will last for the same period of time.
The situation with regard to the plant's Block II is rather more complicated because the Lithuanian parliament has not to date fixed a definite date for it to be shut down.
During the discussions I have mentioned, I have however informed the Lithuanian government that the Commission is of course prepared to provide the necessary help in this aspect too, and is moreover willing to organise international aid.
A country like Lithuania can quite clearly not manage the huge task of shutting down a power plant like this one by its own resources alone.
It would, by the way, also be quite unfair to demand that of them, for it was not Lithuania that wanted the plant.
On the contrary, the Lithuanians even resisted it at the time.
It was the former Soviet Union that built this plant on the spot where it stands today, and certainly not in order to provide Lithuania with electricity, but, in the main - we believe - for military purposes.
It is, then, part of the legacy of the former Soviet Union, burdening a poor country like Lithuania.
It is in our interest that this legacy should disappear.
Mr President, does the Commission intend to issue a common safety standard for nuclear power plants which will be binding on the EU's Member States and applicant States, or, alternatively, to start drafting lists of power plants in the area of the Union on the 'name and shame' principle?
Mrs Korhola, you will be aware that the Commission is not competent in matters of nuclear safety.
There are no EU norms for the safety of reactors, which I myself greatly regret, but it has not to date been possible to change this situation.
The Council has worked intensively on this issue, precisely because the Commission has no competence in reactor safety issues.
The Council's working party on nuclear issues has applied itself to the safety situation in Eastern European nuclear power plants and presented a report just before the summer recess, which is no doubt available to Parliament.
I recommend that you study this report, which does not of course state that we have laid down European norms, but from which it is clear that the European Union, as regards the safety of Eastern European nuclear power installations, makes demands that it believes to be justified.
A list of nuclear power stations, such as you have proposed, resulted from investigations carried out much earlier, at the beginning of the nineties to be precise. These installations, which in the view of the European Union are not capable of a retrofit - that is, they cannot be made safe - are situated in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria.
We have, as you know, made it a condition for the commencement of accession negotiations that the issue of the shutting-down of these nuclear power stations should be finalised.
Mr Crowley, the event to which you refer is of purely domestic political significance in the Czech Republic; it is an expression of an internal political dispute between government and opposition.
In such instances, the Commission can do no other than refrain from taking up any position, because it strictly refuses to be drawn into internal political disputes, whether in Member States or in acceding countries.
Mr President, first of all the Commissioner is being very facetious with his answers.
The quote is directly from him.
It is not an internal matter, it is something that he got involved in when he admittedly, privately, that if Mr Vaclav Klaus became premier again, the Czech Republic's EU entry chances would be harmed.
The Czech Prime Minister said on a radio interview shortly afterwards, and I quote directly from what he said, 'I again repeat those words were not uttered publicly, nevertheless they have not been embargoed.'
Commissioner, do you deny that you made such a statement?
Also, on matters exclusively for the Czech people - electing their leader, what stance they should take with regard to negotiations with their accession to the European Union, and particularly at a time when confidence building is required both within the EU and within the accession countries - do you think it is right that you as an official and a Member of the College of Commissioners should be interfering with the democratic wishes of the Czech people, or indeed the people of any country?
We would all like to see certain outcomes from elections because of our own political beliefs, but some of us have to temper our language and our thoughts because of the positions we hold.
Therefore I would ask you, once again, to specifically either deny or admit that you made the statement and also to explain why you interfered in such a way?
Mr Crowley, I had always believed that a gentleman would not wish to know what two other gentlemen had discussed privately.
If you want to change that, then that's up to you.
I will neither confirm nor deny anything in this matter.
Stony silence is the only way the Commission can avoid being involved in internal political disputes.
I will, however, quite gladly say something about the actual substance of your question.
The president of the Czech parliament and I have for many years been able to talk intimately and in confidence with one another.
The most recent, and, I might add, entirely private, in-depth conversation took place only a few days ago.
The president of the Czech parliament did not mention in this conversation the event that you have taken as the basis for your question.
But it means much to me that Mr Klaus, in the many, many conversations we have had, has always made it clear that he, himself, and his political friends desire and support the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union.
That he occasionally expresses other views, views differing from those shared by the majority in Europe, is well known, but he is quite entitled to do so, and we, as democrats, must accept that.
My final point must be that it goes without saying that the European Union has the right to tell candidate countries what it accepts and what it does not; to point out that certain criteria are required to be met for accession negotiations to begin and to be concluded, and that the most important of them is the political criterion according to which a country must guarantee that it is a democracy under the rule of law, respecting human rights, protecting minorities and sharing the values and objectives of the European Union.
It has come about that a country seeking membership has been told, on the basis of this assessment: 'We cannot start negotiating with you about accession, because you do not meet these political requirements.'
The question you have asked, whether political intervention of this sort occurs, must therefore be answered very clearly in the affirmative.
It is precisely what the Copenhagen criteria require.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Mr Crowley has the floor for a brief point of order.
Mr President, on a point of order.
The Commissioner did not answer my question, because he said he would not reveal what took place between two gentlemen. He went on afterwards to reveal what took place between two gentlemen - himself and Mr Klaus.
Therefore he has failed to honour and respect this House by giving a direct answer to a direct question.
It is a disgrace.
Question No 43 by (H-0710/01):
Subject: Alpine Convention - the environmentally sensitive Pan-Alpine region In its sections on the environment and transport, the Alpine Convention provides a definition of the environmentally sensitive Pan-Alpine region.
In the Commission's estimation, does that definition - and the transport policy objectives thereby pursued - also form part of EU transport policy for this environmentally sensitive region?
Mr President, the Commission is aware of the importance of a suitable definition of the concept of sensitive areas, especially in the case of the environmental integration of transport flows in the Alpine region.
At the moment, there is a series of definitions of sensitive areas created, in particular, by the United Nations and the Alpine Convention, and also by the Community legislation on the protection of the environment.
The Commission believes that sensitive mountain areas, especially the Alpine region, as they are normally classified, are clearly priority areas in terms of the application of Community measures intended to reduce the environmental effects of transport and remove the link between increases in transport flows and economic growth.
Therefore, the White Paper on the European transport policy with a view to 2010, approved on 12 September, pays particular attention to the sensitive areas, especially the mountain regions, within the framework of the policy on charging and funding for infrastructures and the policy on the trans-European transport network.
The approach largely conforms to the guidelines expressed in the Alpine Convention and its Protocol on transport.
Commissioner, I wish to put a short supplementary question.
I was not entirely satisfied with the reply.
Above all, I am concerned about what we are doing now.
Are we to wait for technological innovations, for example the fuel cell, to at least partially solve some of the problems we have with traffic across the Alps or should we not now use the truth about the cost as an instrument to force heavy traffic, in the Alps at least, off some of the roads and onto the railways?
Mr President, in accordance with what was said in the White Paper on transport policy for the coming years, the Commission hopes, possibly within a year, and perhaps even before next summer, to present to Parliament and the Council of Ministers a new system of charging, specifically a modification of the 'Euro-disc' Directive, which will deal with just this type of issue, in accordance with the Costa report approved by this House a few months ago. It will include, in the charges, concepts such as external costs, including certain perfectly quantifiable environmental costs.
Also cross-subsidisation, that is to say that part of the toll currently charged for existing infrastructures may be used to create a fund to finance alternative infrastructures, especially in the region of the Alps, in projects such as the Brenner tunnel or the Lyon-Turin connection.
As the authors are not present, Question Nos 44, 45 and 46 lapse.
Question No 47 by (H-0746/01):
Subject: Mont Blanc tunnel and operational guarantees The Mont Blanc tunnel is due to reopen within the next few months.
In the light of the disaster which led to its closure, what technical guarantees has the Commission obtained as regards the 'new' tunnel's compliance with the relevant European legislation, in terms of environmental standards and sustainable transport?
How does the Commission view the new Italian-French management arrangements for the tunnel?
Mr President, the Commission does not have the power to give the green light to the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel. This matter does not come within our competence.
The task of assessing whether the safety level is sufficient falls to the operators and the national authorities, in accordance with their competences in France.
On that basis, it is for them to decide whether all the safety conditions are met.
According to the information available to the Commission, tests should be carried out in October to check that the security elements are operating correctly, such as the ventilation system or the electronic control centre, and the degree of training of the staff in charge of operation and emergency services.
In this respect, one of the main measures to be implemented relates to the distance between vehicles when using the tunnel.
Furthermore, this measure will contribute to restricting the circulation of lorries via that route.
With regard to organisational aspects, an important element is the creation by the two original companies, the French ATMB and the Italian SITMB, of a single company to take charge of managing the tunnel.
With regard to sustainable mobility and the great number of operators who are impatiently awaiting the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel, given the serious disruption caused by its closure and the saturation of the routes which have been used as diversions, it should be pointed out that, in the short term, the reopening of the tunnel is going to be very positive from the point of view of sustainable mobility, the environment and safety.
I insist, however, that the safety measures must be in place as a prior condition for its reopening.
In the longer term, the absolute priority is to maintain control of the flow of land transport in the Alpine region, without hindering freedom of movement and economic development and, specifically, access from the Italian Peninsula to the rest of Europe will be based on the elements which I mentioned a moment ago, that is, by providing the Alps with major rail crossings which will carry a large proportion of the rail transport burden.
Commissioner, I reiterate that European legislation does exist on this matter and it must be respected, that the specifications of the new tunnel are practically the same as those of the previous tunnel, that 97% of the community of Chamonix have declared that they are against the reopening of the tunnel - which will inevitably damage all the private businesses, polluting all the typical, customary economic activities of these communities now and in future - and that the Italian government is preparing to reduce the night-time toll, thus increasing the pollution.
What guarantees does the European legislation protecting the environment offer these communities?
Mr President, with regard to safety standards, I refer back to what I just said.
According to the information available to me, the conditions for ensuring the control and safety of the tunnel have improved and tests are being done, and when all the requirements are met and the reliability of the instruments and systems is verified, the tunnel will be opened.
This is what I can tell you in relation to safety regulations.
I must insist, however, that Italy and France are the competent administrations.
And no doubt within Italy and France, in accordance with their internal institutional organisation, there are probably certain other regional or local administrations which also have a role to play.
Having said that, I would like to say to the Member that the Community' s fundamental freedoms are the freedom of movement of goods and of persons.
We must guarantee the interconnection between Italy and the rest of the European continent; which clearly means a better distribution of traffic between the Alpine crossings and between the various modes of transport.
At this moment, thanks to the agreement with Switzerland, there are other types of possible access for North-south traffic and for traffic between Italy and the rest of the continent.
The Mont Blanc tunnel is one of the elements, but it is not the only one, and the traffic which has been diverted from the Mont Blanc tunnel is undoubtedly causing an overload in other areas - and I could mention other tunnels which you know even better than me.
In any event, the important thing is to carry out the work on the Lyon-Turin route and the Brenner tunnel, which are key and definitive elements, but which are going to take some time.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I understand your arguments in favour of crossing the Alps.
However, I should like to tell you that at the present time, as I am sure you are aware, the public debate on the opening of the Mont-Blanc tunnel is in full swing, and the citizens of Europe, French and Italian, are appealing to us precisely in order to plead for a different cause, for a real sustainable transport system, which is not transport by road.
Do you really think - and I am asking because you have presented road transport to us as being a sustainable form of transport - do you really think, on the basis of the studies that have been carried out, that the opening of this Mont-Blanc tunnel will be strictly in line, first of all, with requirements, and secondly, with the obligations that we have entered into, in particular with regard to Kyoto?
Very briefly, ladies and gentlemen, I understand that the people most directly affected address themselves to you, but I can talk about other people who are asking just the opposite; that the Mont Blanc tunnel be opened as soon as possible.
As on so many other occasions, there are sometimes contradictory interests.
With regard to the issue of safety, I will insist on what I said before.
It is not the Commission which has to make the assessment.
We have neither the competence nor the capacity to carry out that type of task.
Thirdly, sustainable mobility. That is the objective of the White Paper I have presented and which the Commission approved on 12 September.
However, that objective will clearly not be achieved through a statement of will and an approval by the Commission, but it must be approved by this House and by the Council of Ministers and then put into practice.
It will be efforts of all types over a number of years which will allow us to make progress.
But we must consider that transport sometimes resolves problems created by other types of decisions.
Decisions which relate to urban policy, to development policy, to forms of production, to a series of policies on territorial balance and other things, where transport simply offers facilities at a certain moment, resolves problems and makes its contribution.
In many cases the origins go beyond transport policy.
Question No 48 by (H-0747/01):
Subject: Mont Blanc tunnel and 'piggyback traffic' The Mont Blanc tunnel is due to reopen within the next few months.
In the meantime, road traffic is causing local communities to incur extremely high public health, economic and environmental costs, especially in the mountains, where pollution levels are three to six times as high as in other environments.
What specific measures are being taken to obtain an accurate assessment of the road transport costs, including social, economic and environmental costs?
What steps have been taken to introduce a special tax (as has happened in Switzerland and Austria) aimed at protecting against and making good the social and environmental damage caused and making rail transport, which has considerable potential for further development, competitive in economic terms?
Mr President, in the Commission' s deliberations on the Alpine regions, stress is always placed on the high environmental cost of transport in those regions.
Considerable work has been done by means of a series of Commission studies and the Fourth and Fifth Framework Research Programmes, which have examined transport expenses in the Alpine regions and other regions, including the project relating to the information systems on Alpine transport and the European strategic multimodal model and the Alp-net project which is currently under way.
The problem was also dealt with in the reports of the high-level group, which Parliament approved by means of its resolution, contained in the Costa report on charging for the use of infrastructures, which I referred to earlier.
The new Commission White Paper on common policy not only offers current estimates of the costs of road transport, but also treats as a priority the resolution of the transport problems in the Alpine regions by means of a wide range of measures which I referred to earlier.
In that context, we are studying the possibility of creating a system for testing charging in sensitive mountain regions such as the Alps as soon as possible.
Those initiatives should not only have a possible effect on the current volume of traffic, but above all promote the use of less polluting vehicles and thereby contribute to reducing the negative effects of traffic, both on human health and on the flora and fauna of the regions in question and also allow for cross-subsidisation, which I also referred to a moment ago.
Mr President, as I have said repeatedly, we believe that the modal rebalancing of transport in Europe is a key element not only for the quality of life of our citizens, for the protection of the environment, but also for economic development because, without that modal rebalancing, we will face a situation of gridlock of our road networks and our transport routes.
Thank you very much, Commissioner. I imagine that the Member' s question has been answered.
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 49 to 82 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Question Time.
Mr Staes has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, I have here in front of me a magazine, or at least a newspaper article, which reads as follows : 'I do not approve of the Anti-Slavery Conference in Durban.
It promotes the feeling of victimisation in people who already have the sense that they are victims.
I do not feel happy about the entire Conference in Durban, irrespective of the way in which the Middle East was presented there.
The fact that someone like Castro was cheered, is proof that this was an anti-Western meeting' .
These are not my words but the words of a Member of the European Commission.
In a moment, we will be listening to a statement by the European Commission and by the Council on Durban.
I would invite the Commission to tell us whether it backs the statements by Mr Bolkestein in the Volkskrant in the Netherlands or not, as the case may be.
We appreciate the Members' imagination in introducing their issues into the debate, but we are really obliged to follow the agenda.
Conclusions of the UN Conference on Racism
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the conclusions of the United Nations Conference on racism.
Mr Michel, President-in-Office of the Council, has the floor.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to let you have an initial account of the results achieved at the Third United Nations World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, a conference which was held in Durban from 31 August to 7 September.
The Durban Conference can be described as a success on several counts, despite the difficult political context in which the negotiations took place, and despite the fact that this conference had been described as a failure before it even began.
Firstly, in terms of practical results, this is the first United Nations conference devoted to the task of combating racism which has ended with the adoption, by consensus, of a policy declaration and a programme of action.
The Durban Conference was, above all, an opportunity to reinforce this essential task of combating racist tendencies, tendencies towards the discrimination and intolerance that constitute a feature of everyday life for millions of human beings, who are all too often the silent victims of outrages against their dignity.
Even if in the adopted texts, which form the very essence of what we are talking about, little progress was made, the theoretical contemplation of the fight against racism clearly shows a strong, political will to banish racism.
A call is also made for taking an impressive number of specific measures which aim to fight this scourge globally.
As such, the lion' s share of the 220 articles of the action programme consist of preventive, educational and protective measures which aim to eradicate racism at all levels, as well as strategies which endeavour to attain out-and-out equality of all people worldwide.
By way of example, I will list a few measures which should strengthen the national and regional institutions in their fight against racism, and which must encourage them to step up their mutual cooperation.
Other measures aim to educate people to respect human rights, change their mentality and to grant non-discriminating access to education.
Still other measures place the role of the political parties in the foreground, allowing them to develop internal codes of conduct which will prohibit their members from making public speeches which incite racism.
In addition, there are also measures which must help in the fight against racism in the workplace.
The action programme also contains a number of statutory, judicial, regulatory and administrative measures which must prevent racism and must offer protection against this plague.
The time was too short to bring all negotiations to a good end.
That is why it was impossible to complete the discussions on certain important points, such as the caste system or race discrimination in combination with the death penalty.
However, the European Union did manage to have important themes included in all definitive texts. These themes include the gender issue, better child protection and the fight against the trafficking in human beings, especially women and children.
Here too, I would like to emphasise the difficulties arising from the use of the concept of 'race' .
Today, it is a fact that each theory which supports the existence of different human races is scientifically flawed.
The European Union would like the use of language to follow this trend.
(NL) The EU is of the opinion that the use of terms which acknowledge the existence of different races needs to be avoided.
It is not our intention here to deny the diversity of the human race, but we do want to emphasise its unity, and, as such, fight the present forms of racism which are often based on these kinds of claims.
But due to strong opposition from certain States, we have been unable to make much progress in this field.
The European Union insisted on explaining its fundamental viewpoint on this matter in a last speech, which will also be included in the Conference' s report.
As far as the strategies are concerned, the States are urged to draft a policy and action plan to fight racism, and to implement the Durban action programme.
They are also urged to continue to cooperate in a statutory international framework, especially with the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which is responsible for the follow-up of the implementation of the texts that were adopted in Durban.
(FR) I think I can also safely say that the political scope of the compromise achieved on the causes and origins of racism is another important successful result of the Durban Conference.
Like you, I have read some of the comments.
I certainly do not want to start a controversial debate on this subject, but I will say, on the subject of the forgiveness and excuses which those who negotiated at Durban seem to have been accused of - I was there and I know I had quite a struggle to obtain this text - that of course people of our generation, like those of the previous generation, are not and were not involved in what was all too often misguided colonisation, or in slavery, but I would ask those people the following question.
How can we be satisfied with such a banal, factual observation as that, at the same time refusing, by default, to give justice to those people who, even today, still bear the badly healed scars of colonisation and slavery?
I should like to reply to what I have been reading in the press by saying that we are not engaged, here, in sanctimoniously and naively cultivating a sentiment of injustice.
On the contrary, we have to recognise, on behalf of our forebears, that the evil deeds that were committed were morally debatable, if not downright reprehensible.
We must also tell the victims, past and present, that we know that our history has not always been glorious and that by admitting as much, obviously on behalf of others, we are showing our intention of recognising their right to extenuating circumstances and, having said that, we must propose a true partnership, based on mutual respect, and far removed from the humiliating paternalism and miserly gestures of a self-satisfied and satiated lady of the manor.
I should therefore like, for a moment, to come back to the result.
I believe that the result obtained at Durban opens up positive prospects for the continuation of the dialogue between North and South.
The European Union has recognised and condemned the immense suffering caused by past and present forms of slavery and trafficking, wherever they took or take place, as well as the most blameworthy aspects of colonialism.
It has recognised that slavery and trafficking were crimes against humanity and should always have been crimes against humanity.
Durban was therefore an opportunity to look our common past in the face.
Some people saw that as an act of regret, others as an act of remorse, and still others as an act of excuse.
The important thing, it seems to me, is, above all else, the willingness to close the darkest chapters of our common history so as to be able to construct a new relationship, based on mutual respect, solidarity and partnership.
An appeal has been launched so that more funds can be authorised for initiatives taken by developing countries, in particular the new African initiative.
There is another element which I would not like to pass over in silence.
In the final analysis, Durban was a success because, throughout this difficult negotiating process, the Member States of the European Union remained united.
Intensive coordination was implemented with the support of the Council Secretariat and the Associated States were kept constantly informed.
It was this close cooperation which enabled the Presidency, duly mandated by its European partners, to negotiate delicate compromises with the representatives of the geographical groups concerned, and with the President and Secretary-General of the Conference, Mrs Zuma and Mrs Robinson respectively.
Regular coordination with the Western Group has also borne fruit.
The European Union and its external and common security policy have emerged strengthened from the Durban Conference.
Durban was the proof that the European Union is capable of speaking with a single voice on the difficult question - but one that is vital to the future of humanity - of the fight against racism and for respect for human dignity.
The European Union asserted itself as an incorruptible negotiating partner and mediator.
It presented an image of unity and consistency, and it supported the use of firmness, depending on the circumstances.
As a result, its credibility was reinforced, as was its position at international level.
The proof of this lies in the extreme flexibility and spirit of openness that the European Union showed in the discussions on the Middle East.
The burden of those negotiations really did rest mainly on the European Union following the departure of the United States and Israel.
The re-launching of the Middle East peace process is one of the European Union' s priorities.
However, it believed that the Durban Conference, based as it was on the fight against racism, was not the appropriate forum for dealing with that question Since, however, the Arab and Moslem countries were insistent that the issue should be discussed at Durban, the European Union agreed to take an active role in formulating a draft consensus which was presented by the South African Presidency.
In that draft, the European Union was able to retain the principles which it believed to be essential, namely a balanced text with a strong call for negotiations to be resumed and for violence to be brought to an end, while at the same time expressing concern about the increase in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in the world.
A reference to the Holocaust was retained, whereas the equation 'Zionism equals racism' disappeared, as these were among the conditions and prerequisites.
That was what was achieved at Durban.
We must now look to the future and put into practice those commitments to which we universally subscribed in South Africa.
I must emphasise that everyone should be informed of the positive coverage of this conference.
Each of us, and Member States in particular, must now redouble our efforts so as to ensure that we make the most of the exemplary success achieved by the European Union at the Durban Conference.
I believe, therefore, that we can be reasonably satisfied with the outcome.
I would simply like to say that you get an even better idea of how successful the conference was if you imagine for a moment what it would have represented, in terms of a message or a negative signal, if Durban had not been a success.
I believe that in the context that we are experiencing now, that would certainly not have helped.
I think, therefore, that we did our duty, we did exactly what we ought to have done, it seems to me, in extremely difficult conditions.
I am very pleased to have succeeded, on behalf of the European Union, with the support of the Commission, with the support of the Council, and with the support of the fifteen Member States, but also - which is very important - with the support of the thirteen candidate countries, to have succeeded, in fact, in saving this conference.
If we had not succeeded in saving this conference, I believe it would have had relatively damaging consequences in the longer term.
Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Durban Conference represents a major step forward in the endeavour to bring about global understanding, global political agreement on questions of racial discrimination, racism, xenophobia and intolerance.
I must start by congratulating the Belgian Presidency and because, after all, they do all have names, by offering my special congratulations to the deputy prime minister, Mr Michel, who took centre stage at the Conference and managed to maintain internal cohesion between the Member States throughout and, at the same time, to shoulder the main burden of negotiations at global level.
I should like to thank the European Parliament and the mission for their extremely important contribution to the Conference and for the important part which they played throughout the negotiations and to say that the Commission is satisfied with its contribution and its efforts to support the presidency.
I should like to explain to Parliament and to apologise for being unable to appear in person one and three days before the Conference but health problems at home made it impossible for me to travel.
The Conference was exciting and difficult, with a heavy workload.
The early departure of the United States left the European Union in the position of main speaker and basically left it to shoulder the main burden of the negotiations.
I think that the European Union's profile at this Conference was upgraded to a global profile, given that it managed, in a totally hostile environment, to bring important negotiations to a conclusion while maintaining cohesion between the Member States and maintaining excellent relations and cooperation with the candidate countries.
Of course, we see this Conference as a success, especially if you compare it with previous attempts in 1978 and 1983.
A global message was sent out and specific, globally agreed proposals were tabled.
One comment which could be made is that, throughout consultations over the eight days of the Conference, the wrong agenda prevailed.
The main aim of the Conference was to find a modern definition for racism and to decide on measures to combat it at worldwide level and that would have been a huge success by helping us to deal with the problems of racism today.
These two issues were way down, if not off the bottom of the agenda.
On the contrary, the issues which dominated were the Middle East and past wrongdoings.
Of course, we cannot forget the past.
We need a thorough knowledge of the past if we are to learn from it and avoid repeating it.
However, when it poisons relations, cooperation, agreement and future progress, then it really is an enormous obstacle.
A hostile climate prevailed at the Conference, both at government level and at the level of non-government organisations.
And it must be said, texts appeared couched in terms of hatred which do absolutely nothing to foster reconciliation, build bridges between nations or build a bridge between the future and the past and should be avoided at all costs, especially at international conferences attended by every country in the world.
I should like to refer briefly to the question of non-governmental organisations.
The European Commission has consistently supported the participation of non-governmental organisations at the Conference.
We value their help in formulating and applying policy.
A large sum of money, EUR 3.7 million to be precise, has been earmarked to support the United Nations and, more specifically, the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in order to help fund the participation of non-governmental organisations, especially from countries which cannot meet their expenses.
We have to admit that there is some scepticism as to what their participation achieved and, I think, there was some disappointment about the final communiqué, the final declaration by the forum of non-governmental organisations which Mary Robinson refused to present because it contained inflammatory remarks.
Of course, it is important not to put all our eggs in one basket.
I have to say that the main, important non-governmental organisations working on racism, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and many other non-governmental organisations failed to agree and publicly fell out in an exchange of inflammatory and awkward remarks.
Because, unfortunately, the forum was overpowered by very specific and special issues.
I already understand that certain Member States are re-examining how funding is provided and, of course, the Commission intends to undertake a similar re-examination.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the fact that numerous countries, for reasons best known to themselves, were unable to make an in-depth and positive contribution to the Durban Conference, we have to say that an agreement was reached which lays the foundations for further cooperation at global level.
It sends out a clear message, as the Minister explained, about combating racism at worldwide level and, of course, every country made a commitment to national action plans, national action plans on legislation, the bases of political parties, education, employment and social and cultural life.
However, we must not rest on our laurels.
Recent events after 11 September have shown how easily and often how thoughtlessly racism and xenophobia can be revived.
If we learned anything from Durban, it was that we must avoid stigmatising groups, nationalities, societies or religious minorities.
We cannot ascribe collective crimes to collective people, but we can condemn specific political or other leaders responsible for political mistakes.
The Commission will continue to put its efforts into combating racism by cooperating with the Member States and by keeping its eye on a very ambitious agenda; that means all Member States implementing and incorporating the package against discrimination decided last year by 2003, it means implementing the special programme against discrimination, which is already under way, and it means mobilising and guaranteeing the efficient involvement in this issue of the Racism and Xenophobia Monitoring Centre in Vienna.
Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, there are many people who actually wondered about the usefulness of the Durban Conference.
Yet the international community must exist, and it must come together to discuss the issues, even if such discussions sometimes reveal contradictory interests, and I do not believe that walking out is necessarily a solution.
At least the Durban Conference had the advantage of bringing together the international community on an issue which is undeniably a subject of common concern to all countries, because racism is a scourge of worldwide proportions, and no country is free from racism or discrimination in one form or another.
This conference therefore provided an opportunity to take stock, to make a diagnosis, and what would be the point of such a diagnosis, if there were no treatment?
What could we expect from the Durban Conference?
I do not yet know, Mr Michel, whether it will constitute a success in the long term.
What we do know is how it failed, in other words the fact that there was no final declaration, no confirmation of a worldwide willingness to combat racism and to find adequate means of doing so.
The objective of the Durban Conference was to compile a whole series of worldwide instruments, to draw up a road map, to work out new strategies for combating racism, and action programmes - which you, Minister, have described - which states can exploit, subject to the subsidiarity which is the key to the issue of combating racism and discrimination.
What lessons can we learn from this?
It seems to me that we have been able to avoid falling into three traps.
The first, which you have already mentioned, is the issue of the Middle East.
Any reasonable person knows that the problems of the Middle East would never have been solved at Durban.
Attempts were made to turn this into a major issue, but I think that this trap was, fortunately, avoided.
The second trap is the issue of reparations.
Some people would have liked reparations to be the main subject of the debate.
This was sheer perverseness, if not perversion, because it meant that there was a risk that development aid would be reduced to a form of reparations.
As Mr Michel has quite rightly emphasised, we are all aware of the burden of history borne by certain parties.
We must work towards solidarity between human beings rather than perpetual culpability, which in financial terms would have to come to an end one day, because any reparations expressed in terms of money would, of course, be finally paid off sooner or later.
Finally, the third trap that was avoided was the victim list.
Some people wanted a list to be drawn up.
In our case that would have included the Roma, Sintis and Dalits.
If one draws up a list of victims, of course, there is a risk that the next thing that will be drawn up is a hierarchy of victims, and some may be regarded as being more victims than others, which seems to me to be completely unproductive as far as racism and discrimination are concerned.
In effect, therefore, the declaration is acceptable and I would like to thank Mr Michel, officially, for the essential role that he played as mediator, intercessor and - if I can risk a neologism - explainer.
As you have emphasised so well, Mr Michel, Europe was able to make its full influence felt - and I do not believe that it did so only after the departure of the United States - because you showed great personal commitment, and because Europe consisted not only of fifteen countries, but of thirteen others as well.
In other words a large part of the human race was giving its mind to this subject.
As the Commissioner has said, some of the NGOs made themselves look ridiculous.
This raises the issue of how representative they actually are.
Fortunately, essential partners such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch disassociated themselves from the final declaration, but perhaps it will be necessary to sort out the assistance that we are able to give to the NGOs, many of which, over there, have lost all sense of responsibility to say the least.
We are very mindful, Minister, of the practical side.
The European Union is perhaps not at the bottom of the league table when it comes to combating racism and discrimination, but there is still a great deal to be done.
Let us therefore exploit those 225 articles to find means of action that we can put into practice.
Finally, and I should like to end on this point, I would simply draw attention to the inadequacy of our Parliament' s representation.
This point will feature in the joint resolution.
Briefly, the European Union is represented by the President-in-Office of the Council. The European Community is represented, as an observer, by both the Commission and Parliament.
That is undoubtedly something to think about if we want the European Parliament to play a better role at international conferences, a role other than that of joint observer together with the Commission.
Anyway, this point raises the issue of the renegotiation of the Institutional Agreement of 5 July 2000.
You will find this proposal again in the joint resolution which will very shortly be put to the vote in this House.
Mr President, at the heart of my political group's approach to the Durban conference is a renewed determination to tackle racism and to discover what was positive about this conference.
I say renewed because racism in its many forms has reared its head again, with the tragic events in New York and Washington.
We have now a danger that a renewed wave of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism will come if we do not tackle racism and its root causes.
That illustrated the tragedy of this conference, because I felt I attended two conferences.
One was a historic conference where delegations, like our own European Union delegation, were determined to register that racism is a major human rights issue.
We were determined to define for the first time racism in its many international forms, whether caste, a contemporary slavery, or whether discrimination against minorities within our own European Union and indeed the candidate countries.
We were determined to do something about racism, to show that with Article 13 we in the European Union had something to say to the rest of the world about how we were approaching our own problems.
Yet there was a second conference that I attended, full of confusion, of individual national agendas, a determination not to define racism in different countries because of an embarrassment as to what racism represented in those countries.
The confusion arose over the much misunderstood issue of reparations, and indeed the very destructive issue of Zionism and the problems in the Middle East, overshadowed our conference.
We have to be determined that the first conference, with the ideals we as a delegation defined for it, are renewed in this House today.
That requires a united front.
It requires us not to just say that Durban was chaotic, therefore we will leave it that way for history.
Instead, we as a European Union united, the Commission, the Belgian Presidency - which did an excellent job - those who attended the conference and all of us within this House who want to tackle racism must unite to go back to the original agenda.
That original agenda is one which may embarrass some individual countries, but the action programme is now there.
It is there for us to exploit and it is there for us to do something about.
The issue is not whether this is a failure or not, it is about whether we can now make it a success by renewed determination within this House to get back to the action programme and make progress.
I agree with the President-in-Office and the Commissioner that the conference can be described as a qualified success.
It did get a bad press - in some respects deservedly - but those who say an international conference on racism was not worth holding are wrong.
For the first time in 25 years of trying, international standards were set on the human rights of those vulnerable to racial discrimination.
That is something to celebrate.
We have a basis on which to build in order to tackle one of the great threats to freedom, justice and security in the world, including Europe.
Admittedly, however, the conference did start badly.
Firstly, there was the NGO forum.
Although many of the forum sessions were very worthwhile and indeed inspiring, the NGO voice was hijacked by the proponents of reparations for slavery and those pursuing the line that Zionism is racism.
These themes also dominated or sought to hijack the intergovernmental conference.
There was gross anti-Semitic abuse with, for example, cartoons circulating that could have figured in Julius Streicher's publications from the 1930s.
The document produced by the NGO forum was so bad that the Secretary-General, Mary Robinson, was unable to recommend it to the governments.
Some NGOs, including Amnesty International, had to disassociate themselves from it.
This was a great shame, because so many people had travelled to Durban with the serious intent to tell the world of real daily suffering.
I particularly remember a woman talking about the problems of internal migrants in China.
There were also individuals from many groups who suffer individual persecution such as Roma and Dalits, sometimes known as untouchables.
Admittedly there was a degree of cynical hypocrisy shown by some states in hiding behind the demonisation of Israel and America, including some African countries with appalling records of ethnic discrimination or human rights violations, and Arab countries unwilling to come clean about their own role in the slave trade.
This lack of honesty detracted from the conference.
Opinions can differ about whether the US and Israel did the right thing in staying away.
One can say that the position of Israel, at least, was impossible.
But certainly the absence of the US pushed the European Union into the front line.
One can ask if the EU was fully prepared for that.
But, admirably led by Mr Michel, as has been said, it rose to the challenge.
I have to give Mr Michel particular credit, even if he is my Liberal political colleague.
He came for two days and stayed for a week.
He displayed great personal commitment to ensure that the European Union spoke with one voice and a determination - even if sometimes a grim determination - to reach agreement.
That success was realised.
On the Middle East the language agreed was, on the whole, balanced.
I also believe personally that the language on slavery struck the right tone in speaking of it now as being a crime against humanity.
Clearly reparations were not the right means of redress to talk about.
The irony of the situation would be that African Americans would seek to claim, not Africans, who were not subject to slave trading.
Finally, one of my disappointments at Durban was that with the spotlight on international diplomacy rather than domestic records, the European Union struggled to find the space to highlight its own growing and increasingly solid record in tackling racism.
It is a pity that the EU as such is not represented in the UN system, so that the Commission and Parliament are only observers, although the President-in-Office did a very good job.
Clearly it was a pity that the Commissioner was prevented from attending for family reasons.
We have to find a way of strengthening the ability of all the European institutions to carry on taking a leading role in international human rights and anti-discrimination work.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, participation in the World Conference in Durban was important, as a solemn proclamation of the renewal of an alliance against discrimination and the rejection of respect for human rights, and above all as an opportunity for reconciliation, the only way to reconstruct the future and future peace.
As the Minister has already said, the objective of this conference was obvious, its scope was complex, and it was necessary in order to construct the future.
At the same time, the NGO forum was held.
Although the final declaration appears to be excessive, it merely reveals, not a split, but a great deal of diversity among the NGOs.
Noticeable, in fact, is the absence of the worldwide NGOs, and the virtual absence of the NGOs involved in immigration in Europe.
The only NGOs featured in the declaration are the antiracist NGOs and the solidarity NGOs.
On the other hand, the dynamism of the international NGOs is also noticeable, in the way they challenge power, assert principles, or, then again, consolidate a power already in place, hence in some cases their lobbying activities and their nickname of VGOs (Voluntary Government Organisations).
Yet within this diversity there is a certain amount of logic, the logic of powerful people. On the one hand there is the logic emanating from the rich, developed countries, the former colonisers, and then there is the logic of the poor countries, the ones who were formerly colonised, where power remains to this day hardly what one could call democratic, yet all too often still enjoys the North' s approval.
Words have meaning.
We have to find the right words to provide a solution.
The essential question is that of defining the terminology: slavery, colonialism, racism, genocide, apartheid or military occupation.
All these words tell of daily crises, the consequences, moreover, of discrimination.
We find that the final text talks of remorse and regrets, but refuses to give any excuses, and still less to envisage the prospect of reparations, or to reaffirm people' s right to live in peace and equality, without having to have recourse to international law.
Finally, it is perhaps regrettable that the final declaration is a minimalist declaration which seeks to satisfy everyone by preserving a certain amount of equilibrium.
This declaration not only calls into question the credibility and effectiveness of major international meetings, but also raises the question of direct democracy, because in effect it raises the issue of how representative the limits of participative democracy really are.
I should like to make one final reference to this so-called hijacking of the conference.
Who was hijacking whom?
Why?
For what purpose?
Remember that the United States did not want to take part in this meeting, and that they often threatened to withdraw.
The NGOs' declaration, however hard it might have been, was a good pretext for avoiding any issues with a bearing on the major interests which it was not thought desirable to offend, as well as the issue of reparations.
Several countries, including European countries, were secretly relieved to see the conference focus on the Middle East question, which allowed them to dodge the issue of excuses and to put off dealing with the colonial debt.
Do not forget that the rich countries of the North built their prosperity on the negro slave trade and on colonial conquest, and they are not all willing to recognise this fully or to make reparation for their past crimes.
Moreover, these issues of discrimination against women, children, homosexuals and migrants, and the continued existence of modern slavery, still affect a number of countries which pursue a policy of repression and refuse to allow themselves to be put in the dock.
Those powers are still, all too often, supported, and they too prefer to focus on an issue such as that of the Middle East, where they can make a good impression, rather than be called to account for the human rights situation in their own countries.
Finally, the essential objective of this conference was achieved, but we must now hope that there will be real follow-up action enabling projects, guidelines and action programmes to be set up and put into practice, with a view to preventing and abolishing those situations in which discrimination occurs, thereby ensuring that our fine words are finally translated into reality.

Commissioner, Mr President, the final declaration and action programme adopted in Durban was only possible due to the constructive and essential role played by the European Union. It was also due to the Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Louis Michel' s diplomacy and ability to draw together many points of view, not to mention his natural gift for reconciling the views of all sides.
I sincerely believe that the European Union fulfilled its role perfectly, and we can only welcome the work that has been done.
I deplore the fact, however, despite Mrs De Palacio' s apologies, which I accept, that the European Commission was not present.
I think that at least one commissioner could have represented you at Durban.
I also regret the fact that few industrialised countries were represented, and I believe that many countries interpreted this as a lack of interest in the conference.
Had they been there, it might have prevented the American and Israeli delegations from leaving.
This is even more of a shame because racist violence and support for the populist and xenophobic vote have increased in Europe over recent years; the Freedom Party (FPÖ) led by Jörg Haider in Austria is only one illustration of this.
Other political forces masquerading as NGOs have rushed into the void that has been left.
Since, although the overwhelming majority of NGOs played a decisive role in preparing for the conference, and made several proposals formulating demands, I still do not agree with Mrs Boumediene-Thiery who tries to play down what happened.
This is because a small number of NGOs have been busy trying to equate Zionism with racism, and, even worse, have distributed texts and writings, examples of which I have shown to Mr Michel, in which they patently extolled the merits of the Holocaust.
And this is something that Parliament cannot play down.
These NGOs, or so-called NGOs, these pseudo-NGOs, were not at Durban to defend the Palestinians, they were not there to defend the anti-racists, they were not even there in favour of peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
In my view, it is a positive sign that the final declaration acknowledges the right of Palestinians to their own land and that, at the same time, we reject any equation of Zionists with racists, in the same way as in Durban.
I must therefore ask, as you did, Commissioner, that we know exactly who these NGOs are, what their purpose is and how they are funded before we hold another conference.
The over-representation of some delegations leads me to question how they are funded.
But this conference provided, above all, an opportunity to weigh up the importance of some demands.
And in relation to this, I strongly challenge what my fellow Members, Mr Cornillet and Baroness Ludford said.
I think that acknowledging slavery and the slave trade as crimes against humanity was one of the key aims of the conference, and this is a good thing, and we are merely doing justice by acknowledging that 350 years of deprivation, raids, deportations and humiliations are crimes against humanity.
This is the least we could have done at this conference.
And I hope that all countries and former colonial powers follow the example of France acknowledge slavery and the slave trade, or are made to acknowledge it by their national parliaments, as a crime against humanity.
Personally speaking, I am still dubious about financial reparations, as Mr Michel said, I believe. Especially when we know that there are powerful lobbies of American lawyers hiding behind the African Americans' legitimate demand.
On the contrary, there is in fact a consensus that the continent that suffered most from slavery and colonisation, should be helped with the cancellation of its debt, and by urgently and proactively pursuing policies to combat AIDS and illiteracy.
We owe at least this to the African continent.
In addition, we have - and Mr Michel pointed this out - valuable counterparts in Africa, who are committed, through the New African Initiative, to good governance.
This is, therefore, the time to seize their demand to respond with practical measures and start talking.
Lastly, I regret that there was no mention of the death penalty in the United States, and part of the reason the United States delegation left was because it did not want to talk about racism in its own country.
I regret that discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation was not discussed.
I regret that the concept of castes was not discussed, and I regret that the statement has no binding character.
The European Union' s task is, first of all, to carefully monitor the use of new technologies, such as the Internet, which can be used to incite racial hatred; to speed up the implementation of Article 13; to explain the annihilation of the American Indians, slavery, colonialism and the Holocaust in our textbooks and history books, and also the Sabra and Chatila massacres.
I believe that racism and anti-Semitism have one aspect in common with terrorism.
On the one hand, there are those who carry out the act itself and, on the other hand, there are those who supply them with the ideological weapons.
We must also combat the group made up of the Vlaams Blok, the National Front, the FPÖ and other parties, which supply ideological weapons to those carrying out the act itself and who themselves end up attacking the physical integrity of individuals.
We have a responsibility to do this as well.
Mr President, the resolution of the World Conference against Racism held in Durban is not exactly what many would have hoped for.
I regret the withdrawal of the American delegation.
This certainly did not do it a particular service in view of its own record on racism in its own country.
This compromise resolution makes it very clear that much more needs to be done, especially in relation to our understanding of other cultures and religions.
Islam, I have said many times, has in many ways been demonised, mostly by people who know nothing about it.
Durban was not a failure, nor was it indeed a great success; but it re-emphasised the imperative to make racism a crime, something I have called for many times in this House.
It helped refocus governments' attention on issues of racism, which is based largely on ignorance and a fear of the unknown.
European governments have a responsibility to show leadership in the area of racism and xenophobia and politicians and civic leaders are failing to address the issue of racism in their own communities.
They are showing cowardice and a lack of courage in dealing with this particular issue.
We have a long way to go in the European Union, but at least we have made a reasonable beginning in Durban.
Those who participated in Durban deserve great credit.
The resolution refers to action against Islamophobia, which I support without reservation.
I want to state yet again, here in this House, that I am a friend of Islam.
Muslims around the world have unreservedly condemned these terrorist attacks.
We must all ensure that under no circumstances is there any sort of backlash whatsoever against the Muslim communities within our Union.
These terrorists acts were not carried out in the name of Islam.
They were plainly brutal terrorist acts of a premeditated and determined nature.
Just let me remind the House that no religion - or political movement for that matter - is without its fundamentalists.
Mr President, I too would like, first of all, to congratulate Mr Michel, the President-in-Office of the Council, for I feel that the tenacity and determination with which it was attempted to avoid the shameful outcome towards which the Conference was headed are, above all, due to him.
I feel that the United States and Israeli delegations did well to withdraw from the work of the Conference, just as I feel that you did well, President-in-Office of the Council, to stay on to achieve a result, for, in actual fact, the two things are not incompatible.
The choice made by Israel and the United States served to show the world public what was in danger of happening, that a group of countries, mostly non-democratic with total contempt for their own people, was attempting to exploit the Conference in order to take sides in international politics.
This is why I support most of what has been asserted by my fellow Members, namely that, in present times, the most dangerous and widespread form of racism in the Member States of the European Union and elsewhere is the conviction that democracy and the rule of law are institutions which are only beneficial for Europe, the West and the United States, and not for some of the other communities in our world, and that they must not be exported and strictly respected in other countries as well.
The image of dictatorships which oppress their own people, their own race and their own flesh and blood, of dictators and their representatives who have the gall to preach antiracist sermons at the United Nations, is an effective illustration of the obstacles facing the international community.
None of this can be tolerated, and I feel that the decision taken by the United States and Israeli delegations and the determination of Mr Michel, in particular, and the Council as a whole as well, have served to make this very clear.
I would like to end by associating myself with those who are calling for a detailed inquiry at this juncture into where, within the non-governmental organisations, responsibility for what happened lies - clearly, as always, we must avoid putting everything under the same umbrella - for there is no doubt that responsibility does lie somewhere and it must be ascertained where, not least in view of the generosity displayed by the European Union and the European Commission towards non-governmental organisations.
Mr President, the World Conference against Racism, in conjunction with the United Nations-sponsored International Decade of the World's Indigenous People, has been a unique opportunity to consider the challenges and dangers faced by these peoples and all Stateless nations.
Unfortunately, I cannot agree with the optimistic view expounded by Mr Michel, though I recognise willingly the very important role played by him.
I was in Durban on that special occasion, and so I can give evidence to this House of a very insidious threat to indigenous peoples running through the provisional agenda of the Durban Summit, paragraph 27 of which states: "The use of the term 'indigenous people' in the World Conference against Racism... cannot be construed as having any implications as to rights under international law".
Through that paragraph the United Nations Summit tried to exclude all these peoples from the right to self-determination recognised by the United Nations itself and international covenants.
In response to such inadmissible discrimination and intolerance, the NGO forum in Durban denounced very strongly the new expression of neo-colonialists that will, in the long run, provoke the decimation of the cultures and civilisations of these vulnerable peoples.
This insidious action was prepared at the Conference against Racism with a view to the future.
It looks to the future, not to the past.
As the NGO final declaration clearly suggests, structural racism in the past, current manifestations of neo-colonialism and the denial of the fundamental right to self-determination lie at the root of indigenous suffering.
Mr President, seldom has a UN Conference been so well-intended and so badly understood as Durban.
In my view, this is partly due to poor preparation.
Diplomats and officials should have made more of an effort to reach consensus before the Conference.
That would have saved the world community a great deal of money, time and embarrassing moments.
Particularly unfortunate was the fact that a number of delegations ran off, for however well-founded their reasons may have been, those who run away are always in the wrong.
Against this background, it was all the more surprising that, despite the obstinacy of Louis Michel, for that is how we have all come to know him in Belgium, and now also in the rest of the world, a sound final declaration was obtained after all.
This final declaration contains a number of important provisions which, if applied, could drastically change the lives of hundreds of thousands, even millions of people.
Governments are encouraged to allow minorities to speak their own language, acknowledge their own culture and profess their own religion, to stand up to police services who display racist behaviour and are also encouraged to adjust their legal systems so that they do not discriminate against certain groups.
Roma and gypsy children must be given the same education as other children.
In the field of migration policy, race discrimination must be banished.
I also welcome the sound and balanced provisions on the Middle East, which emphasise the right to an independent State for the Palestinians as well as Israel' s safety.
And finally, two centuries after the events, Europe has apologised for the slave trade.
After all, we should not forget that at least ten million Africans were transported to America in what is known as forced migration on the largest-scale in the history of mankind.
Millions more lost their lives during the slave hunt or one of the infamous cargo ships.
The statements Commissioner Bolkestein made in a Dutch newspaper last weekend are therefore completely misplaced.
'I am not satisfied with the excuses of the UN Conference in Durban.'
He said: 'I myself have never had a slave, so why should I apologise?'
That kind of statement bears witness to a Western arrogance which overlooks the fact that American prosperity is partly built on the labour of slaves, and European prosperity is partly built on the raw materials from former colonies.
Can this serve as an excuse for governments in developing countries to shirk their responsibility and shift all the blame to the past?
No, certainly not.
But rather than giving other people lessons in civilisation, we should have the intellectual integrity to describe this chapter in our history as it was: A crime against humanity.
The United Nations Conference on Racism is of particular relevance in these turbulent times, when there is bloodthirsty talk and behaviour in the name of a confrontation between civilisations.
We are witnessing armed conflicts which originate in and are sustained by racial or ethnic conflicts and we are astonished to hear statements whose content and origin are unacceptable, on the superiority of certain civilisations over others.
I would therefore like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers, Mr Louis Michel, in particular, on his efforts which led to the final success of the Durban Conference, in which I participated on behalf of this Parliament.
His actions clearly demonstrated the European Union' s firm position in relation to racism and xenophobic attitudes.
Without ignoring the social, political and economic problems which lead to racial discrimination in Europe, I would like to focus on one aspect - the development perspective - which has been somewhat forgotten in the stagnation of recent events and also during the Conference, in relation to the Middle East conflict and the seriousness of the events taking place there, and to the recognition of the suffering caused by Europe' s history and the perversity of slavery and slave trading, the practice of which we today see as a crime against humanity.
The majority of ethnic conflicts which involve thousands of victims and regrettable human situations take place in developing countries, mainly in Africa.
I therefore believe that the success of this Conference will depend on whether we are today capable of realising everything that was contained in its final declaration.
In this resolution, we ask the Commission for financial support for the administrations of the developing countries for the implementation of national action plans to eliminate all kinds of discrimination, as was agreed at Durban.
Forums and observatories must be created, observatories in Africa, provincial observatories, regional observatories.
We also ask for support for the United Nations so that it can carry out the monitoring of the results of Durban, so that the fight against racism may remain on the international agenda until it is eradicated.
I believe that we must continue working so that the contents of the declaration may be implemented.
Of course, the United States should not have abandoned the Conference, but it was not the first time that they have abandoned it, since they had abandoned it on other occasions; this was therefore not important.
The important thing is that we in the European Parliament are able to clearly repeat our message with one voice, to journalists, to the media, against racism and in favour of equality and integration.
The President, acting President-in-Office of the Council, and the Commissioner will have to excuse me, for one minute of speaking time leaves one very little time to say much at all.
But great efforts do not necessarily lead to great results.
A lack of effort, however, can lead to disaster.
That is why I should like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council for his efforts in Durban.
Sometimes, it seems as if our Commissioners are looking at a different Conference from the one Mr Bolkestein is talking about, when he states that such a conference promotes a sense of victimisation in people who already have the feeling of being victims.
That is regrettable, of course.
Mrs Diamantopoulou, you state that there was actually a hostile atmosphere at that Conference.
It is all the more important then that we are very aware of the fact that we always carry a level of latent racism and latent hostility around with us, and that we are very careful that people keep track of their sense of identity - and I know what I am talking about, for that is a very important theme in our groups.
From the moment that identity leads to a sense of more worth than, and underestimation, of others, and that that sense is instilled in an entire group and transferred across to other groups, ethnic and racist tension ensues, which can lead to major conflicts.
It is unfortunate, but we cannot say that that is not true for Europe.
This is borne out by the success of racist parties in some of our countries, the conflicts in the Balkans, or the tension in the candidate countries.
We must employ a great deal of patience and determination to make a difference.
Durban may be a start.
It was certainly not the end, for the bulk of the work will need to be done in our own communities.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I find it a very positive indicator that this conference was held in Durban; that there were wide-ranging discussions; that a resolution was drafted; and that there has been a conclusion.
I find that this discussion, in some respects, looks too little to the future and considers too few definite and preventative measures to combat racism so that, if possible, it does not even come into being.
I would like to call at this point for the European Union itself to take the lead by good example, and I wish now to refer to two areas of current significance in which we can do something tangible, namely asylum policy and immigration policy.
If we succeed in what we have set ourselves, that is, in implementing a unified asylum policy with minimum standards and rapid and reliable decision-making, we will no longer have the situation that faces us now, with asylum seekers waiting for years in ghettos, constrained to work outside the law and becoming marginalised.
Rapid decisions lead to help being made available quickly and to recognised refugees being speedily integrated; it prevents the marginalisation that at present occurs.
This would amount to the prevention of racism!
I seek progress in immigration policy as well.
If Member States, as far as they are able and presupposing that work, accommodation and educational opportunities are available, accept citizens from outside States and offer help with integration, then that is another step taken against exclusion and discrimination and in favour of integration, and I believe we should grasp these practical tools in order to be really successful in preventing racism and discrimination.
This is an opportunity for our European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, the World Conference on Racism in Durban was overshadowed from the outset by a political strategy of discrimination.
Arab States attempted to impute racism to Israel, with the intention of making the Arab world out to be victims of Israeli racism, which was then to be condemned by the conference.
This was a perfidious strategy.
They attempted to make use of this important conference for their own purposes.
Like the conference as a whole, any attempt to seriously get to grips with this strategy was sunk by the terrible events on 11 September.
We now have a situation in which the entire Arab world is in danger of itself being pilloried in a racist way.
All people of Arab origin or from an Islamic cultural background are in danger of having the deeds of a small terrorist group laid at their door.
There are, unfortunately, already examples of how this can happen openly and violently.
It can also, however, happen surreptitiously through concealed mistrust.
Either way, it is a creeping venom seeping into our open society and becoming a burden on it.
This would represent a victory for the terrorists.
So let us not allow it to happen!
Let us not follow the bad example that cast a pall over the Durban Conference.
We Members of Europe's Parliament, above all people, must be wary of rashly pigeonholing people by nationality and religion.
Let us be an example.
Let us continue to be open and tolerant.
But the terrorists must be in no doubt: they will be pursued with rigour, with no regard to race and religion.
We here can do something against racism.
Let us act accordingly and give an example.
That will be worth more than all the conferences in the world, something that will be demonstrated when we take this debate to its post-Durban conclusion.
Mr President, the European Union bears a particular responsibility in the fight against racism and racial discrimination.
The action plan adopted on 8 September in Durban is an important message and a contribution to creating awareness in the fight against racism and xenophobia.
The conference's eventual agreement on a joint declaration is to be welcomed.
Although many, but not all, NGO's and also many States strenuously attempted to convert the Conference into a unilateral forum of condemnation of Israel and to make the issue of slavery and colonialism an opportunity for demanding compensation payments, it can be counted a success that the Final Document did not take up extreme positions of this sort and that it came into being at all.
With hindsight, however, we must ask ourselves whether the European Union's generous support for the NGOs, which I consider justified in principle and which amounted to EUR 3.7 million, always found its way to the right destinations, all the more so as agitprop arguments to the effect that, for example, Zionism is equivalent to racism, are very much part of the political vocabulary of many States, Syria being one example.
The biggest terrorist attack to date against the civilised world took place three days after the Durban Conference.
None other than President Mubarak of Egypt has pointed out that human rights issues are often misused by terrorist organisations in order to build up their international networks.
Mark well, though, that human rights and the fight against racial discrimination and xenophobia are indivisible and of global significance.
Nobody is immune, as demonstrated by the ethnic conflicts in the Balkans and the most recent tragic events in Northern Ireland.
The Durban Action Plan is an important document for every State, but also for the European Union as a whole, which bears great responsibility in this respect, above all in the framework of the United Nations.
I wish the EU's role were more visible there as well.
Mr President, the debate on the outcome of the UN Conference on Racism is particularly topical following the tragic events on 11 September.
Unfortunately, the global coalition against terrorism appears to exist alongside a xenophobic revival, as Mrs Diamantopoulou said earlier, and a tendency to demonise whole groups of people, mainly Muslims and Arabs.
According to the international press, the majority of the public in Holland, 62% to be precise, in a country with a long tradition of democracy, considers that the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington will seriously impede the social integration of Muslims in Holland.
At the same time, there is support in Germany for reviewing the legislative framework governing religious organisations.
A few days ago in Britain, a nineteen-year-old Muslim girl and a taxi driver were the victims of an unprovoked attack.
During this morning' s debate on asylum and immigration, several members in the House expressed anti-Islamic views.
These developments are most worrying.
Europe' s experiences from the horrendous wars of the twentieth century highlight the danger to peace and democracy and to human dignity of racism, xenophobia and nationalism.
In the light of recent events, the European Union and the Member States need to strengthen their legal mechanisms for fighting racism and to take initiatives at global level to reduce the gap between countries and to ostracise violence as a means of resolving differences.
Fighting terrorism and dispensing justice should never call our democratic achievements and respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights into question.
Finally, I should like to thank the President-in-Office, Mr Michel, and the European delegation as a whole for helping to make the UN Conference in Durban a success.
Mr President, racism is one matter on which there exists a great cultural unanimity: that it is wrong.
Nobody wants to be accused of racism; it is one of those strong and highly-charged words which can easily be used not only to struggle against injustice but also to attack and to brand people.
The shadow declaration which preceded the NGO Conference on Racism, in which Israel was accused of racism - without any simultaneous condemnation of anti-semitism - created a distorted starting point for the UN conference.
We Members of the European Parliament, too, have seen with our own eyes how anti-semitism appears in the form of naked racism in Palestinian textbooks.
The tone of debate was unfair to Israel when account is taken of its past and the obvious desire of hostile States to deny Israel's very right to exist.
I certainly do not deny the problems of the Palestinians; these need to be rectified.
But no solution will be generated by obfuscating facts in one way or the other.
It is tragicomic that, while condemning discrimination, one is guilty of that very thing oneself.
This unfairness unfortunately harmed the credibility of the NGOs and damaged the prestige of the Conference on Racism.
As a friend of the civic society and of NGOs I particularly regret this: by its lack of consideration, this body has weakened its own credibility and future operating prospects.
I very much appreciate the way in which the most respected human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch immediately dissociated themselves from the text of the NGO conference.
Similarly, I wish to thank the representative of the presiding State, Belgium, whose intervention on behalf of the EU justifiably stressed that the conflict in the Middle East is a political one and should not be treated in a conference on racism at all.
What, then, should have been discussed?
What did all this political talk crowd out?
According to Amnesty International, many critical matters such as the treatment of refugees, human trafficking, persecution based on the caste system, and the rights of gypsies threatened to remain unnoticed.
And, unfortunately, this is what happened.
The Indian untouchables, for example, made strong efforts to bring up their own plight in the NGO forum on racism.
Discrimination against untouchables is, according to them, a hidden form of apartheid.
Mr President, the Durban Conference provided an important opportunity to condemn the phenomenon of racism and xenophobia, sending out a clear and powerful message, the need for and importance of which remain highly relevant today.
The twentieth century bore witness to the most horrendous crimes committed in the name of racist doctrines which, we should bear in mind, took place in Europe, whose civilisation was the birthplace of the great declarations on rights.
The Durban Conference, however, was much more than an exercise in the duty of remembrance.
Durban reminded us that the modern world has proved itself incapable of eradicating racism and xenophobia from its societies and these, even in Europe, continue to create victims and underlie violent conflicts.
Unfortunately, some people have succumbed to the Manichean philosophy, lacking in any historical rigour, that gives Europe a disproportionate and over-simplified responsibility for all the evils and oppression associated with racism, such as the use of slavery.
Europe does not reject its history, neither the enlightened times nor its darker moments, but nor must it allow it to be crassly manipulated.
Europe must not allow its history to become a mere settling of accounts, with the past being placed in the dock in order to exonerate the present time and conceal modern responsibilities for the persistence of the abject and anachronistic phenomenon of slavery and, more generally, of the systematic violation of fundamental rights.
Judging history with the eyes of the present is a pernicious exercise in populism that simplifies the complex and, consequently, offends the truth.
Manicheism seeks to segregate fanaticism and use the whole gamut of crusades that interpret history as an endless struggle between Good and Evil.
A fanatic, by definition, has no interlocutors, only enemies.
History is not merely the balancing of criminal offences and civil compensation laid down in current legislation.
We reject this pointless exercise.
The European Union' s political responsibility for affirming the universal values inherent to human dignity is both domestic and international because it is inherent to the most intimate raison d' être of our common project.
Our collective European responsibility is expressed in the unreserved confirmation of our place in the front line of combat, by the universal affirmation of human rights and rights protecting against racism and xenophobia and in the determination to pursue and extend its constructive role on the international stage, by liberating humanity from all discrimination based on hatred, prejudice and ignorance.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would nonetheless like to briefly respond to the speakers with some considerations, and perhaps with some more detailed information.
First of all, I agree to an extent, as Mr Van Hecke said, I agree to an extent with him in believing we must ensure that we prepare very thoroughly for a conference of this kind.
I think that, essentially, we have, to a certain degree, paid a heavy price for the fact that a number of shortfalls were perceived in the preparations for this conference.
I believe, to use a term that you are familiar with, that there were still far too many 'leftovers' at Durban, which obviously made the task at hand much more complicated.
I therefore think that this preparation is obviously extremely important.
My second comment in relation to this type of conference: I am not sure whether to want to draw up a document that provides a comprehensive list of every situation would not be a mistake, and whether or not, at the end of the day, this would adversely affect the substance of the final document.
By this I mean that, if we had a more concise text, with a specific number of principles that can be generally applied, I feel that we would probably be able to produce a stronger text.
And we can even question whether or not the European Union could perhaps at some point contemplate doing this, in other words, glean from the Durban Conference a basic framework, which would facilitate the roll-out of the Durban achievements in each Member State.
I have heard many people ask the question, 'So, that was Durban - what comes next?'
Ladies and gentlemen, I must tell you that what happens next depends in the main on the Member States.
I believe that it was Mrs Boumediene-Thiery who said that if a State wants to apologise, present or express remorse or regret, at the end of the day, it is up to that State to know how far it can go.
Secondly, I think that each State can very easily put the finishing touches to or devise its own specific action programme to combat racism, based on what was done at Durban, drawing its inspiration from these principles and from what was agreed at Durban.
I also listened earlier to the Commissioner very clearly saying that the Commission was also planning to take some very specific measures.
I think that the Commission has already been working on this matter for some time.
I therefore feel that there will be a follow-up, that there will be another conference after Durban if that is what we want.
In fact, this comes down to the usual question of political will.
Naturally, I would also like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank all the speakers who have expressed their appreciation of my work, which is much too generous.
I believe that I had the support of some extremely competent people from the Commission, Council, and of course from my own delegation.
I was also able to count on all those representing the various European countries.
I feel that it was logical to do the work that we did.
I think that it was perfectly natural.
I would like to perhaps respond to a number of comments about what is lacking in the documents.
Yes, they naturally lack a number of points.
For example, why is there no mention at all of the caste system in the documents adopted at Durban?
This is a particularly important subject for the European Union, I am aware of this, and what is more, I share this concern.
As you know, the European Union is concerned about situations involving discrimination throughout the world; therefore it was natural that we also express this concern.
We closely followed developments regarding this problem and we supported a paragraph put forward by Switzerland, discussing this problem. The text makes references to discrimination based on ancestry and occupation, which clearly describes types of discrimination, the helpless victims of which live in several countries around the world.
Unfortunately, despite all the efforts of the European Union and other countries, particularly South America, it was not possible to reach an agreement with India on this paragraph.
Since this conference was based on consensus, as you know, the text was therefore withdrawn, and this is something I regret.
However, we must also remain realistic and realise that we cannot achieve everything.
One speaker quite rightly mentioned the problem of the death penalty. This is a subject that is of particular personal concern to me.
As you know, the abolition of the death penalty is one of the European Union' s priorities.
I believe that we are right to reiterate this, and we are endeavouring to use every possible opportunity we are given at international level to push forward the debate on this issue.
This was the case at the Durban conference.
The European Union supported a paragraph of the action programme referring to racial discrimination in the application of the death penalty.
The United States strongly opposed this paragraph during the preparatory process, however, and several countries, particularly those in Asia, also rejected it and, without consensus, it was not possible to retain this text either.
I am obviously giving these examples in order to convince you that your concerns were relayed and were expressed in Durban, but unfortunately we could not achieve everything.
I would like to briefly mention the behaviour of the NGOs throughout the conference.
As stressed in the documents adopted at Durban, civil society, and NGOs therefore, have an important role to play in the fight against racism.
That is why the NGO forum organised prior to the Intergovernmental Conference was particularly important for the European Union.
In my view, this is also the reason why the European Commission funded most of those taking part in the forum.
Unfortunately, although the forum provoked some interesting debates, I, myself, took part in a debate that I found extremely interesting, the forum followed a process that was, at times, dubious and, at others, totally undemocratic.
Extremist organisations seem to have monopolised the discussion, which forced Member States to disregard the conclusions of the forum.
Some NGOs, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and FIDH, also disassociated themselves from the forum' s outcome.
Moreover, we must admit that the aggressive approach and disgraceful verbal abuse from some NGOs raises the question as to why the European Union and its Member States as well - my own country included - give their unconditional support to these organisations.
I think that we must also discuss with the NGOs such issues as their accountability, their representativeness and the confines of their responsibilities.
As I have already said, I enjoyed a very good relationship with most of the NGOs, and I also acknowledge that they have a specific role to play.
Earlier, I heard Mrs Boumediene-Thiery use a rather subversive term - which is a great credit to you, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery - but we could have a fundamental difference of opinions.
Personally speaking, as a democratically elected politician, I am not willing to give up my prerogative to assume political responsibility on behalf of the people.
I have been elected, the people can therefore reject me, which is what I call responsibility, and I must also be accountable to the people - these are, essentially, my two duties.
I am not therefore willing to let this prerogative be taken away from me because, when this system of political responsibility ceases to exist, we would no longer have a democracy, in other words.
And that is something that I cannot accept.
I did want to bring up one particular subject - which Mr Sylla mentioned, I believe - that of discrimination on the basis of sexual preference, which is one of many forms of discrimination.
The European Union was in favour of highlighting the many forms of discrimination that affect some classes of people.
This concept is certainly present in the texts.
However, when it came to defining potential sources of these many forms of discrimination, it was not possible to include concepts that the European Union considers to be important, such as discrimination based on sexual orientation.
This idea was firmly opposed by some countries, as you suspected.
The only aspects that everyone found acceptable were the sources of discrimination listed in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, in other words, race, colour, sex, language, religion, political belief or any other belief, national or social origin, wealth, birth or any other situation.
What are we doing in terms of following up this conference?
I shall conclude by reiterating my earlier point that it would be the task of each Member State to follow up the Durban Conference, but it has already been decided that the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights will primarily be responsible for providing this follow-up.
Several measures must be implemented, particularly the creation of an anti-discrimination unit within the Office of the High Commissioner and the appointment of five highly-regarded independent experts, who will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the provisions contained in the action programme and the political declaration.
These experts will be appointed by the United Nations Secretary-General.
Naturally, I wanted to provide you with this clarification, first of all because I was also keen to congratulate those speakers who made such relevant comments, and I wanted to tell them that their strong convictions have served as a significant driving force and support enabling us to defend the points of view that we expressed on your behalf in Durban.
In accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received six motions for resolutions to end the debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 8.20 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Vehicles designed to carry more than eight passengers
The next item is the report (A5-0312/2001) by Mr Miller, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive relating to special provisions for vehicles used for the carriage of passengers comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver' s seat, and amending Directives 70/156/EEC and 97/27/EC (C5-0278/2001 - 1997/0176(COD)).
Madam President, I welcome everybody here again tonight.
I see a good number of familiar faces.
I wish to pay tribute to my shadow rapporteur, Mr Harbour, who again is attending a late-night sitting with me.
We probably spend more nights together than we do with our respective wives.
I should also like to pay tribute to a number of people who have worked on this report, not just within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market but also within the Commission and the Council.
It was not a difficult conciliation but it was successful and I was very pleased at the outcome.
I should also like to give the thanks of probably about a third of the population of the European Union to Parliament, for I am anticipating that the vote tomorrow will go the right way.
There are something like 35 million registered disabled people within the European Union; we have 120 million elderly people.
The two groups are obviously not mutually exclusive, but they make up about a third of the population of the European Union.
The outcome of tomorrow's vote will very largely decide what their quality of life in the future will be.
For years now people with disabilities have not been able to get around the towns and cities of the European Union as they should; they have been trapped for too long in their own houses.
If this directive is adopted tomorrow, it will open up that door.
It will be one small step towards freeing a lot of people who, as I said earlier, have been trapped.
I would like to convey their thanks to Parliament.
I realise that some of my colleagues on the right of this House have had difficulties with this directive, mainly because of its technical nature.
I fully understand and appreciate that.
However, I would ask them at this late stage to consider what we are doing, because if this directive is adopted tomorrow, it is something that everybody in Parliament could be proud of, because we would be improving the lives of the citizens of the European Union.
For once we would be making a difference.
Too often we stand up in this Chamber and talk about various great plans, schemes and motions, etc. and they do not impact on people's lives.
Here is a small thing that does impact on the lives of the European citizen and it is something we should all be proud of.
I understand my colleagues on the right will be abstaining tomorrow.
That is unfortunate but it is, at least, an improvement on voting against in the second reading.
I would ask them, however, to look at this again and cast their votes in favour, because all along I have tried to leave out the technicalities and have concentrated purely on the policy and philosophy of getting people with disabilities mobile again.
That is an aim and objective I think we would all agree with.
In that respect, I have really not much more to say, because this has been discussed at length.
The Commissioner is well aware of the contents of the report and probably could recite them as well as I could.
Finally, I should like to thank very much all those who have helped draft this report and who tomorrow will help to adopt it.
Madam President, once again it is a genuine pleasure to be working with my friend Mr Miller.
I want to pay tribute to him for his persistence in working through this, and particularly for the masterly way in which he handled the conciliation process.
This is the first time I have been involved in a trialogue, so I have been able to study the process at work.
Indeed, as he says, we have reached a very satisfactory outcome.
I fully supported the final compromise and, indeed, the benefits that it will deliver.
It is important that we finally, after five long years, bring this to a close.
In a moment I shall refer to some of the issues involved.
However, it is important to add that, in delivering the sort of benefits that Mr Miller was talking about, we need to reflect the fact that a lot of other improvements to the infrastructure associated with public transport will also be needed.
The buses are only part of it.
That is something that we have not been able to tackle but that other committees will wish to look at.
What about the principles?
He quite rightly said - I tipped him off beforehand - that we will be abstaining on this.
It will go through tomorrow.
We certainly do not wish to obstruct it or vote against the conciliation procedure, but we feel, on this side of the House, that the principles that led us to vote against this last time - and my colleague, Mr Rübig, who will speak later, is a veteran of the previous process - are entirely consistent.
So we will not be obstructing it.
It will go on its way with our qualified support.
Mr Miller has played the role of the man riding the last dinosaur, if I may put it that way.
Commissioner Liikanen told us at second reading in the debate that he does not envisage bringing a regulation of this complexity before Parliament again.
That is absolutely the right approach.
I want to take the opportunity to say to the House tonight that I, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, have made a proposal to other committees and to the Commission on ways in which Parliament can exercise its political role in scrutinising and putting forward ideas for motor vehicle regulation.
We have suggested that the Commission should bring to us on an annual basis a comprehensive report on its plans for future motor vehicle regulation, specifying where it is going to use the Economic Commission for Europe proposals and, indeed, covering some of the voluntary regulation process that we have talked about.
That will allow this Parliament, through all its various committees, to take a serious look at the political content of regulation and not ever again become immersed for five years in this sort of complex, technical regulation - a process that we finally sign off this evening.
Mr President, one of the objectives of the directive is to improve access to public transport for persons of reduced mobility.
The European Parliament and the Council seriously disagreed on this point.
The European Parliament' s insistence on provisions to facilitate access for persons of reduced mobility, especially wheelchair users, was vindicated, as was the rapporteur, Mr Miller.
The agreement reached in the Conciliation Committee, which is in line with the position taken by the European Parliament, proves yet again how important issues such as the quality of life can only be promoted through courageous policies which are free from technocrats' reservations and financial considerations.
The proposed directive introduces a broader definition of the term 'persons of reduced mobility' , stipulating that it includes all people who experience some difficulty when using public transport, especially the elderly and the disabled. Reduced mobility does not necessary depend on some form of medical complaint.
This is an important innovation which could be used as the starting point for similar adjustments to give substance to policy on the quality of life.
To be specific, disability may take different forms, including not just physical mobility but also intellectual and sensory impairment.
Therefore, it also includes people who merely have limb impairments, are of small stature, pregnant women etc. It also states that all sloping areas in vehicles must have a non-slip surface.
It is also worth pointing out that it does not limit itself to vehicle specifications; in order to ensure passengers can board safely, it also makes provision for easier access through local infrastructure planning.
This should guarantee safe, pavement-level boarding by all persons of reduced mobility.
I would like to believe that the spirit of agreement achieved here will prevail over other similar endeavours.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate about this directive is above all a dispute about principles, about whether we, in the European Union of the future, want the principle of harmonisation, that of mutual recognition or the 'third version' - where do we need the one and where the other?
We have achieved only a small partial success with this directive on the EC procedure for approving vehicle types because, of course, national procedures for type approval still apply concurrently with, and in addition to, the directive which is now being laid down.
What we want matters here, and I would like to express my thanks to Mr Miller for working so hard to ensure that what we want prevails.
This is, of course, not true of national procedures for type approval, which prevail at present and will continue to prevail in future.
The success is a very modest one, and we will therefore be abstaining tomorrow, because it does not go far enough for us, because we would actually have liked a general regulation for all buses.
I must also say that the Commission's proposal was a very, very good one in terms of content and from the points of view of engineering and technology, but must be rejected absolutely on the grounds of logic.
At first reading, we had 160 pages of detailed Commission proposals on the table, Members worked out another 110 amendments to them, and I think this House and, at the end of the day, Europe as a whole, is overburdened with this sort of detail.
The state of affairs we will be deciding on tomorrow is such that we have now even fixed the curvature of the rear panel of a bus at a normative maximum of 150 mm.
Even compared with the European standard cucumber, that is a sensational success!
Madam President, I wish to congratulate Parliament and, in particular, its Conciliation Committee and the rapporteur, Mr Miller, on their success in reaching an agreement with the Council on this very important directive.
I should like to stress that, with this directive, the European Community will be setting the pace and enabling the industry to compete under common rules to produce safe and more accessible buses and coaches for the benefit of all European public transport users.
This directive makes significant progress in three areas, namely the internal market, the transport policy and the social policy of the Community.
The access provisions for buses and coaches as regards boarding by persons with reduced mobility will ensure that a larger proportion of our citizens use public transport.
I should like to reply to the question by Mr Harbour.
I received the letter based on his proposal from the chairman of the committee, Mr Westendorp y Cabeza, and I have sent him a detailed reply, which supports this initiative.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon on Wednesday.
GALILEO
The next item is the report (A5-0288/2001) by Mrs Langenhagen, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission communication to the European Parliament and the Council on GALILEO (COM(2000) 750 - C5-0110/2001 - 2001/2059(COS)).
Madam President, Commissioner, we are latecomers; time is running away from us and, above all, from the GALILEO project.
The longer the European Union hesitates in getting the European satellite navigation system underway, the more both industry and the people will react to it with apathy.
The ultimate danger is that GALILEO will one day be buried.
My anxieties increase when I recall some of the statements made to me over the years when I worked on the European satellite navigation project.
The position Parliament has taken with regard to the Commission's communication does not, admittedly, possess any legislative character, but points in an important direction.
I hope that it will be by a large majority that Parliament will adopt my report tomorrow and thus support the position that Europe urgently needs a satellite navigation system of its own, not least in view of the special situation in which Europe and the rest of the world find themselves since 11 September.
The Council also holds this fundamental view, as again confirmed by the final conclusions from Stockholm.
How, though, may we clear away the doubts that surface again and again, even in the amendments before us?
The fundamental issue is now as it was before: why do we need a European satellite navigation system of our own, when the Americans have already supplied a working model in the form of GPS?
Let me quote some of the main arguments.
The first is that the American system is conceived on military lines, with resultant disadvantages as regards continuity of availability, precision, and also legal certainty.
What concerns us here is reliability, which must be guaranteed even in a crisis.
It must be clear to all of us that Europe's sovereignty and security would be gravely imperilled if the navigation systems were to be taken out of European control.
We quite evidently need our own civilian system which, however, must be available to all - and I emphasise all - potential users.
I regret therefore that I am unable to support the amendments newly reintroduced by the GUE/NGL Group, which demand a purely civilian use.
Secondly: we are pressing for free competition not only within the EU, but also worldwide.
It can, then, be only a cause for amazement if we readily accept a monopoly from a foreign State and expose our users to the risk of provision being less than optimal.
We must commit ourselves to the best interests of our citizens and users.
Thirdly: if the European Union were to do without its own system, it would fall back massively in the high technology sector.
That can surely not be the intention.
On the contrary, we want to see Europe at the top, and for that we need GALILEO.
Fourthly: GALILEO creates employment in Europe.
The jobs created are for the highly qualified and in a sector with a future, namely high technology.
The building-up of the infrastructure and the many potential applications could create up to 100 000 jobs in the next few years and result in high earnings in the market.
Why, then, is GALILEO vital for Europe?
In my report, I have described at length the advantages and positive aspects for the various fields of application.
These advantages become all the more convincing if we succeed in involving other countries in the project.
For example, China expressed interest only recently, at the Brussels Summit.
Europe is capable of developing its own system.
We are not going to keep GALILEO, like a confection, for our own enjoyment, but will offer it to those of our partners who are willing to have it, and we will let those partners share in the great benefits.
As we want to offer the best service possible, we set great store on compatibility with other systems from the outset.
Industry is showing an interest, as demonstrated by the EUR 200 million pledged to the Commission as a statement of intent, but we must not make excessive demands on Europe's industry.
The wheels of industry will not start rolling without a clear and definite political signal, a green light given by us.
The preparatory work done by the Commission and the European Space Agency deserves high praise.
Now, though, I await expectantly the Commission's financial and administrative framework, as called for in the report.
This framework will be a further building block and a weight-bearing pillar for developing our own satellite navigation system.
GALILEO is a Community project - incidentally, the first in this field, which makes it a vision for the future!
Let us now, then, get to grips with it, instead of putting it off forever and a day, for GALILEO will revolutionise transport and mobility, just as the Internet has done.
Success stories - of which we in Europe can already claim a few - require careful thought, courage and decisiveness.
Let us make good use of this historic moment when we vote tomorrow!
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets on the Commission communication on GALILEO, I will confine myself in this speech to the financial side of the project.
At the current stage, GALILEO does not comply with the statement on financial programming, which was adopted by the three institutions on 20 July 2000.
According to this statement, 'the budgetary authority must have accurate information about the financial consequences of each new proposal presented by the Commission, in order to be able to assess the impact of the proposal on the ceilings of the financial perspective (...)' .
Furthermore, at a meeting of EU transport ministers in April 2001, it became clear that the Union had major problems finding the extra EUR 1.5 billion required from private sources for the deployment phase (2006-2007) of GALILEO.
On the other hand, the Commission states that when it issued a call for an expression of interest in order to establish the conditions needed in order to set up a public-private partnership, several European industrial consortia responded to this, without reference to any further problems.
I would like to make it clear that I support the Commission' s approach in principle.
Nevertheless, I would warn that GALILEO may have a much bigger impact on the general budget than initially expected.
I consider that the budgetary authority should have a clear picture of GALILEO' s source of funding before it can commit appropriations to the project.
The identification of the sources and amounts of private funding should be concurrent with the identification of public funding.
Financing needs should be met by 2002.
Then, Parliament should demand prior consultation of the budgetary authority in the event that the expenditure to be financed from the general budget is to be revised.
This would ensure that no restrictions are placed on other activities financed under heading 3 if GALILEO does not attract the investments foreseen by the Commission.
However, following my approach, in a situation of crisis, the European Union would have the possibility to use the satellite navigation services provided by GALILEO without having to rely on other (primarily military) satellite systems operated by the United States and Russia such as GPS and GLONASS, although it would still be compatible with them.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we would like to give our opinion on the GALILEO programme, taking into account the decisions made, namely by the Stockholm European Council on 23 March 2001.
At this Council meeting, great emphasis was placed on the need to launch this satellite navigation programme immediately.
Our Committee acknowledges the benefits of such a programme, the main feature of which is that it is European as well as civilian in nature, and is therefore independent of systems developed by the military, such as the American GPS and Russian GLONASS systems, and that is reliable and has greater precision than these two existing systems.
We are proposing, however, that the following points be implemented during the development and validation phase from 2001 to 2005, the deployment phase from 2006 to 2007, and the operation phase, which begins in 2008, essentially under the aegis of the European Space Agency and the Commission.
First of all, we must accurately monitor the funding, initially estimated to be in the region of EUR three billion, as well as the partners chosen, particularly private industries, and their involvement. We must also carry out an in-depth analysis of the cost-effectiveness and the implications for the economy and employment.
We are demanding the greatest level of transparency in this matter and to receive regular information from Parliament.
Secondly, we stress the fact that the structures established during the development of the programme should be used solely for civilian purposes, and we point out that it is vital, in this case, to develop the use of space for purposes related to the general interest and public service.
Thirdly, the GALILEO programme must not be applied in such a way that will jeopardise the right to or the protection of privacy and it must not under any circumstances be used for the surveillance of citizens.
It must, in particular, be developed in order to protect and safeguard the environment, to protect the lives of citizens and natural resources, and ensure early detection and even prevention of natural or man-made disasters.
It must also contribute to progress in European research, when drawing up the future Sixth Framework Programme.
Lastly, we are proposing - and this is important - to set up an advisory ethics committee, whose task would be to ensure respect for the aforementioned requirements and which would assist the Commission and the European Space Agency in their decision-making duties.
I want to emphasise - and I call on Mrs De Palacio to give us her point of view - the fact that it will be civilian organisations that set up the system.
Of course, we cannot say that, 'we will not vote in favour of GALILEO if it is used by the military in the future' , because, when we set up transport and communication systems, for instance, anyone can use them.
What matters is that Europe is independent and that it is not dependent on the USSR or the US.
We believe that these various provisions are realistic conditions, which must accompany and justify GALILEO, and we would also hope to hear Mrs De Palacio' s point of view on setting up the ethics committee.
Madam President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, competition stimulates business, as the example of the motor industry over the last 100 years has shown.
The fact that there were at least three major production centres, the USA, Europe and Asia, was extremely good for business all round.
Airbus is another good example of what can be achieved by exposure to international competition, if we are not simply content for other people to make a good product that we can buy or even use free of charge like the GPS.
It will be no different with what we are discussing today - the GALILEO satellite navigation system.
Of course it is no bad thing that GPS exists.
Of course it is no bad thing, it may even be a good thing, that in many cases it is available to users free of charge.
But that there is, to all intents and purposes, only an American system is not good at all.
The Russian GLONASS is probably not entirely in the same category.
We Europeans have no real rights of access.
The examples there have been in the past have shown that we are suddenly bereft of navigation in one case or another.
Almost more important and quite central from my point of view as a university teacher is that we have no real involvement in technological innovation if we are not engaged in development ourselves, if we do not carry out research ourselves and if we do not ourselves take research to the applications stage so that it can also go into industrial production.
We need both, we need access and we need technological development.
We cannot talk about a society of knowledge and learning without taking the next logical step.
Above all, too, we also need the many potential applications in transport.
I believe that requires no further explanation.
Admittedly there are also problems when it comes to GALILEO.
The problems of finance have still not really been resolved.
Industry is still biding its time, waiting for public funding, while the public authorities in turn plead Maastricht criteria, empty pockets and the like.
Hopefully there will sooner or later be a genuine public and private partnership in this matter.
A last word on the tricky subject of double use or only civilian use.
I cannot understand the naivety of many of the tabled amendments.
There is not only good in the world.
The events of 11 September were a cruel demonstration of that.
Finally a word of thanks and appreciation to the two ladies who have made such a big contribution to this evening' s report, the rapporteur Brigitte Langenhagen and the Transport Commissioner Loyola de Palacio.
Neither of them lost their bearings in dealing with this topic.
Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen on her excellent work, which also received a notably favourable vote in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
I hope that the same will happen tomorrow when the House votes on the report, since this is a particularly important, even historic text for the European Union.
The European Union is a major power.
Europe is a major player in the aviation and space industries, but the European Union does not have aviation and space power, since it has never had a policy in this area until now and, as Mrs Langenhagen said, GALILEO is a historic beginning for us, our first Community programme.
The GALILEO programme is all the more important because it guarantees that the high technology and the activity of our industries will be maintained in the future, since 150 000 jobs will be created.
GALILEO represents the political independence of the European Union, since, as you are aware, we had no frequency access during the Kosovo war due to the American GPS system, and as things stand at the moment, we cannot count on the American system being completely reliable in the coming years.
I therefore believe that it is crucial that we consider the success of GALILEO as vital in ensuring the EU' s credibility over the next few years in an area where competition in the aviation and space industries is increasingly marked, particularly when faced with new competition, for instance from China or Japan.
We are also concerned about how this operation is funded, about the delays in its implementation and that it has been postponed on numerous occasions.
Let us be clear about one thing - in the space industry, as in all the other transport industries, nothing can be achieved without State funding and without a boost from the government, whether this is direct State funding or so-called co-funding, along the lines of the American model, where the military sector funds the civilian.
We must be aware of this situation.
With regard to infrastructure, it is very difficult to find private sector investment, therefore we must be prepared, the Commission is not only responsible for this, Member States are responsible as well.
The Council must certainly be made aware of this.
This is why the Group of the Party of European Socialists did not want to increase the number of obstacles.
We shall not vote in favour of the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left or the amendment by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party on the funding method, whereby the GALILEO programme must be halted if private sector investment is not sufficient. This is because we believe GALILEO is a crucial programme for the future of the European Union and for the future of European space policy.
Madam President, first of all, I should like to say a word of thanks to Mrs Langenhagen for the huge amount of work she has carried out on this topic.
It has been a long haul, with obstacles and unruliness along the way, and the end is certainly not yet in sight.
However, we are taking an important decision tomorrow, which will bring us one step closer to our goal.
International developments underline the importance of having a system of our own, but at the same time, of establishing sound international cooperation, so that interoperability of the system can be achieved.
I should like to mention three other points which the ELDR Group considers important.
First of all, the management structure.
To the ELDR Group, it is important that the management is transparent, and we are already glad of a major step forward by the Council, namely the proposal to set up a single administrative structure in agreement with Article 171 of the Treaty.
The second point I should like to raise is the financial concern.
We are still not entirely convinced that that is going in the right direction.
We accept that at the beginning, public money must be invested, but industry must contribute too.
There must be a balance.
There is still no binding agreement with the private sector and there is still uncertainty in that area.
That is why we have tabled an amendment for which I should ask your support, so that the European Union does not become a safety net.
And given the high cost, we expect a contribution towards the cost of the use.
Improved geographical access and reliability must be factors in favour of which industry must choose and in which they must display willingness to invest.
That is exactly what makes the system first-rate.
Madam President, Commissioner, a great deal of work has been done.
A report has been drawn up.
That too took up a lot of time.
However, a whole host of arguments are being put forward, with which - let there be no mistake - I entirely disagree.
The wrong arguments are being used in order to sell a project.
Let me start with the technology.
Some people claim that superior technology is being used here.
That is absolutely not the case.
GPS is a similar system.
Our system is slightly better because it uses ground stations.
As a result, it is slightly more reliable and communication is possible.
But the subsequent generations of GPS II - did you think the Americans were mad? - and GPS III are just as capable.
No problem whatsoever.
If we consider the levels concerned, the first level is an open access system, which is free.
It is similar to GPS with matching criteria: same height, same accuracy in terms of horizontality, etc.
The subsequent systems CAS I and CAS II are commercial and intended for the government, while the latter system is also used for military purposes.
To quote another point on which people appear to be misinformed: it is also possible for CAS II to be switched off at regional level if it is used for military purposes.
You may not have been aware of this, but that is the case.
All in all: GALILEO is not more accurate, and it cannot be switched off.
In summary, all those technological features which have been listed, also for transport, are also very much part of the current system.
Where military use is concerned, we are agreed that we do not want this in any event.
I will not enter into the detail of the arguments, but at this moment in time, in the light of 11 September, I do not find it necessary to highlight the need of such a system once again.
It is somewhat inappropriate, in my opinion.
It is clear that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has agreed to the wording for civil use, and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has not.
It will be interesting to see what tomorrow brings when the amendments are tabled.
As for the funding, the Council has launched an enquiry.
It appears that there are actually no business partners.
One and a half billion must be coughed up.
Two hundred million is being freed up indirectly and it is suggested that that funding is now available.
The problem in this connection is that it is the same people who have freed up tens of billions for UMTS.
When I listen to Mrs Langenhagen' s opening words, I have a feeling that GALILEO will be laid to rest in the not too distant future.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Langenhagen, the GALILEO project is technologically interesting and already has a lot of potential applications.
Up until now we have had the similar Russian and American systems, but these were designed and developed and are also operated from a military perspective.
The American system does in fact hold the real danger that in times when the USA is using it for military purposes the Europeans and all civilian users will be switched off, as actually happened during the Gulf war!
The GALILEO project is now being presented as a civilian project that will make the European Union independent from the USA in an important field of technology.
In my group, too, opinions on the GALILEO project differ widely.
But we are united on one point: we want it to be used for purely civilian purposes.
We have tabled amendments that are designed to ensure its exclusively civilian use.
Mr Rack, I am neither naïve nor do I believe there are only good people in the world.
But if we do not do this, we will have the same problem as with the American system, namely that when it is being used by the military it will be switched off for civilians.
You are not solving the problem you are claiming to want to solve.
Secondly, I also have concerns about finance.
A total of EUR 1 730 000 000 of European taxpayers' money is to be spent on development, validation and construction.
Industry wants to join in the construction phase, contributing EUR 1.5 billion, but so far only EUR 200 million have been committed.
That is 13%.
From a business point of view, no company could afford to develop something with such a poor equity position.
I think it an impertinence that you want to pay for this out of public funds!
Thirdly, there is another aspect to this GALILEO project.
The Americans allow the GPS to be used free of charge.
You want future users to pay for the European system.
Where do you think that will land you with your much-vaunted competition?
Competition works like this: if I am being asked to pay for something that I can get free somewhere else, I am not going to pay, and you won' t get any users.
Then you will have thrown all that taxpayers' money away!
Mrs Langenhagen, you described this so beautifully as a confection, and Mr Savary used the word historic!
This historic confection will cost a total of EUR 3.2 billion.
I think that is much too expensive for the present time and at this stage!
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the development of a European satellite radio navigation programme raises various questions that warrant our consideration.
This is a project of global scale, that uses cutting-edge technology and involves vast amounts of public and private financial resources.
The strategic importance of political decisions which must be taken for the project to a large extent explain the hesitation that the Council has shown, despite the commitment and enthusiasm that both the Commission and the European Parliament have demonstrated in their statements and in the documents they have drafted.
In fact, the problem is not insignificant.
First of all, because a project of this scale requires close international cooperation.
This cooperation is fundamental, not only because of the future installation in various parts of the world of control centres and communication equipment to support the around thirty satellites that will also have to be sent into space, but also because the success of a project of this nature clearly depends on its interoperability with other, existing systems: the North American GPS and, to a lesser extent, the Russian GLONASS.
It therefore makes no sense to base the argument and the need for a system such as GALILEO on a vague feeling of suspicion in Europe and amongst Europeans towards the United States due to the situation of near total monopoly that that country currently enjoys.
And which could cause it unilaterally and for no plausible reason, in other words irresponsibly, to stop data transmission via satellite, or to introduce unacceptable levels of signal degradation affecting the accuracy of this data for civilian users.
The GPS system and the radio navigation by satellite that this allows have been used successfully by the whole world, particularly in Europe.
It should be added that reception of GPS signals has been completely free to users and any member of the public can access the necessary sectors at an affordable price.
The reasons that the European Union must use in its definition 'Development, installation and use' of a system of this type are, of course, quite different.
They chiefly concern the boost that GALILEO would give to the European high-tech industry and providers of related services, thereby introducing an element of healthy economic competition in this sector of activity, which is crucial to its development.
This system would also provide enormous assistance to the development of European technological potential and to improving the associated academic and applied research.
We must also emphasise the invaluable contribution that a project of this scale would make to the creation of new jobs - more than one hundred thousand - and we are talking about highly qualified posts.
And, lastly, the installation and use of the system would enable the development of a public or private partnership of enormous strategic value to support sectors as important as transport (maritime, air or terrestrial), air traffic management, search and rescue, meteorology, mobile telephony and so many others.
It is for all of these reasons, which I have briefly summarised, that we give our support to the GALILEO project, in the hope of thereby contributing to the construction of a genuine Europe of the future.
Madam President, Mrs Langenhagen predicts a rosy future for the GALILEO satellite system.
This is understandable, based on her line of thinking.
However, I, coming from a critical stance, can see major drawbacks to this project.
The calculated costs of this project are more than considerable, especially now that the contribution of the private sector is not clearly marked and secured at all.
Despite the fact that, according to the Commission, only 150 km of high-speed link can be built for the funding initially required, any amount is too high if it does not yield clear advantages.
In this case, the advantages should mainly be in the field of reliability and price.
As things stand at the moment, it is very likely that GALILEO will become a facsimile of the existing system, at least in terms of functionalities.
Despite the civil line of approach, the system will also boast a military component in time.
I have no doubts about that.
This brings to an end the advantage which GALILEO would have compared to existing systems, namely to be independent from military use and more reliable as a result.
What remains is a situation in which we obtain the same services at higher costs.
However, the most important aspect to us is that the system could play an unwelcome role in the relations between the European Union and the United States of America.
Especially in a military context, it has appeared more than once that the European Union produces little without the United States.
Not only does stirring up trouble in the relationship with the United States not make any sense, it is also very dangerous.
That is why I am in favour of accepting the existing offer and not deluding potential users with illusions.
For it is very much the question whether the use of satellite signals will be better and more efficient than it is at present.
Mr President, have you noticed that, not just the Commissioner, but the president and the rapporteur are also women, a coincidence which I think augurs well for the future of GALILEO, even if he was a man.
So, having congratulated the rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen, I should like to make a point of repeating the view that, at every stage in the design, implementation or application of the system, the political decisions will need to be discussed and taken at European Union level and at that level only, although the role of the candidate countries will, of course, also need to be determined.
It is equally obvious that international collaboration with the United States and Russia is essential, not just in order to reduce the huge costs but also because the question of frequencies can be regulated so as to guarantee reliability by ensuring that enough frequencies are available for GALILEO to provide a broad range of services.
Of course, we need more information on the organisation, administration and funding of the implementing agency, with integrated, realistic proposals, mainly as regards private investment.
At least, from the information available to date, there appears to be no particular drive to attract private investment, given that we have not yet clarified if the system will provide services in return for a fee, which it will need to do if there is to be private investment, or free of charge, so that it can compete with GPS, which provides its services free of charge.
Finally, is there any chance of Member States being called upon to pay large sums of money from their national budgets so that the initial appropriations are not lost?
I think the Commission should give a prompt response here.
Similarly, we must push ahead and resolve outstanding issues, by which I mean technical issues, such as incorporating EGNOS and the corresponding financial analysis and lawyers, both at Community and national level so that we can make any deliberate interference in or distortion of the system a crime and set up an authority to decide when to impose sanctions.
We trust that, one way or the other, GALILEO will progress more quickly now.
Madam President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen, for her work on the report.
I am taking the floor today because I feel we need technical systems that offer environmental benefits.
Technical progress is ever more rapid.
Personal computers and mobile telephones have drastically altered our working lives and our everyday life.
We have also seen how technology is changing all the time and creating new aids and how companies are forever developing new products to be used within different areas of society.
A European satellite navigation system can, in fact, mean major opportunities for developing the transport sector, especially when it comes to combined transport, dovetailing different types of transport.
For aviation and shipping, too, as well as for transport by road and rail, the new technology can be used to make transport more efficient and environmentally friendly.
I do agree with the rapporteur that GALILEO will enable Europe to be involved in developing a new technology-based industry and to be in the vanguard of this.
There is a space industry in various parts of Europe today, for example in northernmost Sweden, and I think it important that we should use existing infrastructure to keep down the future costs of this project.
Major technical breakthroughs have more often than not taken place following development using research supported by the public sector, often with a view to the research' s being used for military purposes.
The money and resources needed for developing completely new technologies often do not exist in private companies.
This particularly applies to the GALILEO project which is based upon joint financing by the EU countries but to which the private sector too has to contribute.
What is unique about GALILEO, unlike the GPS system, is that it is being developed for civil rather than military purposes.
I consider this to be an absolute prerequisite for the European Parliament' s supporting the project.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank you once again for the European Parliament' s constant and determined majority support for the GALILEO satellite navigation programme.
The resolution contained in Mrs Langenhagen' s excellent report is testimony to this and I thank her for her work.
Please allow me to make some comments on the motion for a resolution based on the Commission' s communication of November 2000.
At the end of June, the Commission sent to Parliament and the Council the proposed regulation on the statute of the GALILEO joint undertaking.
I would like to insist on the importance of this proposal which is intended to establish a single management structure for the programme at the beginning of 2002.
Given that the timetable is so tight, it is essential that Parliament can issue its opinion on this proposal before the end of the year.
In accordance with the conclusions of the Transport Council of last April, we have implemented a study of the services which GALILEO may offer, the income it may generate and the methods for collecting it.
This study must be finished in the coming weeks so that the Transport Council in December may take the decisions necessary for the programme to move ahead.
Of course we will send the results of this study to this House and I hope that those of you who have expressed more reservations about the programme will find that it provides better explanation and greater confidence and that we will therefore have greater support - I know that it is supported by the majority of this House, but also that some of you have expressed significant reticence, if not opposition.
As the motion for a resolution clearly states, international cooperation is essential to the GALILEO programme.
Its objective is to guarantee the interoperability of GALILEO with the existing radio-navigation systems, such as the American GPS or those in preparation, such as the Russian GLONASS.
In this respect - and some of you have wondered whether or not it is necessary - I would like to say that the idea is that they are compatible and that they benefit each other mutually.
Ladies and gentlemen, after what happened last month, the need for a second system which reinforces the existing system and which provides greater security and is, when the time comes, not only a complement, but also an alternative in the event of possible unwanted situations - when we are seeing a huge increase in the applications which affect all the areas of our lives relating to GALILEO - is absolutely essential, not only for Europe, but for the whole world, including the users in the United States.
It is also important that we have the support of third countries so that we might have the necessary frequencies, principally within the framework of world radio communications conferences - the next one being in 2003.
As you know, the allocation of frequencies is due to be consolidated in 2003.
When this happens, it should aid participation in the development of the GALILEO programme.
With regard to the data issued by GALILEO, the international and Community instruments intended for its protection will clearly be applied.
As Mrs Langenhagen' s report stresses, we believe - and this is one of its special features compared to the GPS system - that GALILEO must supply a public signal, that is, a robust and precise signal which cannot be interrupted as a result of military issues, as happens in the case of GPS, and sensitive applications, whether they be public - customs, judicial investigation and so on - or private - such as banking transmissions.
Finally, allow me to sum up the next stages of the programme.
At the end of the year, after receiving Parliament' s opinion, the Council must adopt the statutes of the GALILEO joint undertaking and decide how the programme must continue to be developed by the said joint undertaking in close cooperation with the European Space Agency.
As some of you have said, the green light must be given to the GALILEO project once and for all.
The development phase, which should last from 2002 until the end of 2005, should allow the launch of the first satellites with a view to testing the system in reality and allow the receivers sector to bring those receivers into line.
As you can see, there is still much to do.
Your support is absolutely essential and, in any event, we will keep this House fully informed of all the steps we take in relation to this project.
Thank you, Mrs De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon on Wednesday.
Energy efficiency labelling for office equipment
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0298/2001), by Mrs McNally, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on a Community Energy Efficiency Labelling Programme for Office and Communication Technology Equipment (6760/1/2001 - C5-0246/2001 - 2000/0033(COD)).
Madam President, I am very pleased to present my recommendation for second reading on the Energy Star agreement.
As you will know, in a rather complex procedure, Parliament has already been consulted on the agreement itself.
This is now the codecision procedure on the regulation which implements that agreement.
I wish to thank the Commission, the Council and my colleagues, in particular the shadow rapporteurs, for their help in steering through this rather complex procedure.
I would like to thank in particular the Swedish Presidency, which went out of its way to be helpful.
The Council common position takes on board most of the points made by Parliament at first reading.
We shall have an earlier review than was expected; we shall have an update on new technological advances in this area of energy efficiency; we shall have a report to Parliament.
Furthermore, the United States' authorities are absolutely clear that Parliament is involved in discussions on the Energy Star programme from the Commission's point of view.
This has been done through a side letter added to the agreement, at Parliament's request, which meets our wishes for them to know how we operate in the European Union.
This clearly is not the only measure which is to be taken in the area of energy efficiency.
I understand there is an update to the common position because of the new Eco-Label award scheme.
I am prepared, as rapporteur, to accept that slight modification which has been made necessary.
Even though I am pleased that it looks as though this agreement is coming into force, I do not want to exaggerate its importance.
It is a useful tool, but it is a relatively modest proposal; it is a voluntary scheme based on a United States model.
I know many colleagues agree with me that in future we should work as a European Union and have European Community schemes rather than attempting to latch on to schemes developed elsewhere, in the United States for example.
Nevertheless, although it is relatively modest, it is welcome.
Computer equipment is sold worldwide and the educative, awareness-raising aspects of seeing the Energy Star logo on computers is worthwhile.
We know that one of the tasks in increasing energy efficiency is to improve public awareness.
It is a small part of what is needed.
Everyone in this Chamber knows that energy efficiency is the most important component of energy policy.
It is the fifth fuel - coal, gas, renewables, nuclear - the fifth fuel, with a 30% potential, is energy efficiency.
If someone from another planet saw us acting as if we had known that, they would think we were stupid.
We are not stupid, we are intelligent and that is why intelligent energy - a phrase with which I hope everyone is becoming familiar - and certainly Mr Wijkman, Mr Turmes, Mrs Van der Laan and I are doing our best to make it a very familiar phrase - and energy-intelligent Europe depends on energy efficiency.
We look to the Commissioner to bring in a package of measures well beyond Energy Star.
They are demand-side management and two important directives: one on household appliances and one on office equipment - not made in the USA.
I hope that during this autumn, under the Belgian Presidency, we will see both of those draft directives adopted.
We have been very cooperative on the Energy Star programme.
There is only one amendment, which could be withdrawn.
If the Commissioner is able to give us tonight an appropriate assurance and accept the spirit of that amendment, which asks her to take further action on the withdrawal of inefficient equipment, it is quite possible that we can approve the common position unamended.
Madam President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs McNally, on behalf of my group for undertaking this technically difficult task and for the tough way she negotiated with the Council, because Parliament' s rights were at stake.
She was in a way having to negotiate a precedent and she showed great commitment and was very successful on Parliament' s behalf.
I would also like to thank the Vice-President of the Commission, who over all has worked very energetically for a European contribution to solving our energy problems.
I think we are all agreed that the more efficient use of energy is a very important contribution to solving our energy problems.
Modern technology offers us ways of saving energy and using it more efficiently.
If we do that correctly, it is actually to everyone' s advantage.
The costs of such technical innovations are small enough to be written off within months or a few years at the most, which means it is to the consumer' s overall advantage and it also gives industry an opportunity to bring its innovations on to the market.
Here we are looking at one way, namely the Label.
It is an important step because it gives us influence over world standards since the Energy Star is used not only in the USA and in Europe, but in other countries besides.
When I took on the task of being my group's shadow rapporteur, I asked firms in my constituency that are concerned with the subject, those that sell or make computers, for example, what they thought about it.
They said the Label alone would probably not achieve much because, when consumers buy computers and similar goods, unfortunately they do not pay attention to energy consumption so much as to various other criteria.
So we should perhaps talk about finding other ways of promoting energy-efficient equipment and gradually removing the big energy wasters from the market.
The amendment in front of us says, after all, that one such way forward might be a voluntary agreement with industry.
We should only think about legislation if that fails to work.
I believe that to be very, very important because, as the rapporteur has said, we are debating here about an agreement with the USA and about a Label, but the solution to the problem does not lie in this Label alone.
I am therefore asking the Commissioner to make very clear in her speech that the Commission is thinking of going further and also to say when we can expect other proposals.
I don' t believe any of us would gain from having to engage in a lengthy conciliation procedure because of an amendment being tabled.
If we achieve a good outcome this evening, we can avoid the conciliation procedure.
Otherwise conciliation would be necessary and I am sure we all want to avoid that.
Madam President, on 11 September the world changed, at any rate the world as we knew it.
Suddenly a regulation that has occupied us here in this House for quite some time has become a small pebble in the mosaic of this changed world.
We know that 11% of electricity consumption - between 10 and 15% in other countries - in private households and public sectors - if we add those as well - contributes to power stations being operated completely unnecessarily because there would be other ways of doing it in standby mode.
On a European scale that means between six and ten large power stations, and they could be nuclear power stations.
When at this very moment the first bombers could already be flying towards Afghanistan and people are wondering what form a possible counterattack might take, we can see that such a mundane thing as this regulation could bring us greater security here in Europe, greater security, too - if we think of the consequences of 11 September - in relation to the probable rise in the price of oil.
From this point of view I therefore very much welcome the work that Eryl McNally has done.
The second aspect that should now again be given particular consideration is that we could provide a stimulus to the economy to which the Commission pays particular attention in the amendment to which the previous speaker has already referred - by finding a way not only to label good equipment but also to remove bad equipment from the market as quickly as possible.
Madam President, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs McNally for her persistence in keeping this report on Parliament's agenda and bringing it to fruition.
I welcome the approach adopted in this proposal for a voluntary code. That is a more pragmatic approach towards achieving improvements.
Unlike Mrs McNally I see no harm in adopting measures that are in place in the United States.
It is one of our aims in Europe to achieve common standards in the internal market.
In that regard, why should we not seek to extend those common standards to our major trading partner across the Atlantic?
Just because it was invented in the United States does not mean it is all bad.
It is very important that we should assist people making choices about purchasing equipment in knowing what the energy efficiency is.
In my own experience, labelling materially affects one's decision.
It certainly affected my decision this summer when I was buying a fridge and a freezer for my home.
The old ones were getting very noisy and very expensive.
It may be that my motive was also concern to stop using so much electricity supplied by a company owned by a French utility, but that is another issue.
I should like to close by supporting the comments about the amendment, namely, that we all look to the Commission to give us an assurance on the issue of the further voluntary code.
This is a healthy and sensible approach.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs McNally, for her work in relation to this Regulation.
I am aware that she has worked intensively with Parliament and the Council in order to reach the position we are in today.
I also hope that we manage to reach an agreement on the text which is acceptable to all of us.
I am sure that none of us want to go to conciliation if we can solve the problem in a more appropriate way, given that our positions are very similar.
This proposal is integrated into the Commission' s action plan to improve the energy efficiency of the European Union.
Office communication equipment represents a high proportion of the electrical consumption of the tertiary sector and we all agree that the use of efficient and ecological office equipment can contribute to the sustainable development strategy decided at the European Council in Gothenburg.
The proposed programme for coordination of labelling, the Energy Star programme, will lead to significant reductions in electricity consumption and CO2 emissions, and is therefore very viable.
As Mrs McNally has very rightly said - and I would like to stress that I am in full agreement with her - energy efficiency is key.
The key thing is to use energy well. That is where we have the greatest margins and we stated this in the Green Paper on the European Union' s energy supply.
After a long period of negotiation, in December 2000 the agreement was finally signed with the United States on coordination of programmes for energy efficiency labelling on office equipment.
Now we need this Regulation so that we can appropriately implement what was signed with the United States.
This programme has already been a success in the United States and has led to considerable participation by manufacturers, the large majority of which have introduced energy-saving devices into their products.
It has also increased consumer awareness of wastage resulting from office equipment in standby mode.
On the basis of the positive experience on the other side of the Atlantic, the Commission is convinced that the Energy Star labelling programme will naturally lead to the gradual elimination of inefficient equipment on the Community market.
We perfectly understand the European Parliament' s concerns in relation to the effectiveness of the proposed Regulation on this specific point.
These concerns are reflected in the amendment which Mrs McNally is still maintaining.
There is no doubt that in other circumstances I would say that I agree with her. However, on this occasion I would ask Parliament to reject it or, even better, that Mrs McNally withdraw it.
Because, although I agree with its content, I do not believe that this is the right instrument in which to include this type of measure. The Energy Star programme is not exactly the right place to include this incitement to renovation, modernisation and withdrawal of least efficient equipment.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to tell the House that we are preparing a framework directive on minimum efficiency requirements in the office communication equipment sector, amongst others, a directive which I hope will be presented to this House and the Council during next year.
I have taken this opportunity to explain the Commission' s position and I hope that Mrs McNally can withdraw her amendment and that we can therefore approve this report on the Energy Star programme today without having to go to the conciliation procedure.
Thank you, Mrs De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon on Wednesday.
Innovation in a knowledge-driven economy
The next item is the report (A5-0234/2001) by Mr Rübig, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on Innovation in a knowledge-driven economy (COM(2000) 567 - C5-0740/2000 - 2000/2336(COS)).
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, why is innovation so important for the European Union?
We can all see that we are having slight problems with the economy at the moment.
If we want the economic situation to improve again, we must take initiatives to get employment rising again, take initiatives to get unemployment to fall, and take initiatives to ensure our continuing prosperity in the future.
I believe we also need to be able to assess that objectively.
That is why we should use benchmarking.
I am very grateful to the Commissioner for putting the innovation scoreboard very much to the fore here, too, because it enables us to see very clearly how the various countries are performing.
And, of course, the method of best practice: to see where among our neighbours of the Fifteen in Europe they are working better than in our own countries.
That is how it always was for me at school: you can learn from your better classmates.
And we shouldn' t just stick to Europe, but we should also be looking in particular at the countries that aspire to join us, to see what they are already doing better than we do.
There is an enormous amount of knowledge, a great deal of capacity for innovation, in the technical departments of our universities, as there is of course also in America, Japan, India and many other countries, from which we could benefit.
Innovation must not take place only in the economy, but also in the social, cultural and above all the political fields.
We would very much like to see publicly sponsored research corrected to make it in future even more geared to the market or, it would perhaps be better to say, to the citizen.
Where in future will we find services or products that the citizen would like, that he needs?
Such market research will be very important for us in future if we are to see where our innovation policy needs to be focused.
Innovation also means repeatedly taking risks, however.
We therefore need to ensure that the necessary venture capital is available.
It is especially when times are getting hard that funding runs short.
We all know that Basle II will perhaps bring a further restriction here, too, especially for smaller firms.
Nevertheless - and I would like to correct the text here - we have 18 million SMEs in Europe with fewer than 250 workers.
We need to pay particular attention to them, since after all they generate 80% of the tax yield and employ two thirds of the workforce.
Innovation must start in the small units.
We need subjective innovation; that means combining familiar techniques and technologies, extending them, rethinking where they can be used and where they can be improved.
One of the central points is of course life-long on-going and vocational training.
Continuing training schemes are becoming increasingly important, and we should therefore also concentrate on the best ways of passing on knowledge.
By e-learning - to use the general term - but much more, I believe, by e-entertainment.
Learning should be fun, learning should be interesting, learning should make you curious, but learning should also be an adventure.
We ought in future to provide an experience primarily with a European content, putting our European values, our European knowledge at centre stage on the Internet and in our education and learning programmes as well as being ready to engage in international competition.
We also need new systems in schools, however.
We need new methods of quality management for teachers and pupils.
ISO 9000 is already taken for granted in firms.
It seems to me that these new procedural techniques could also be used to make appreciable progress in schools.
But enterprises also need easier access to funding.
We need people to start new businesses and the mentality to start new businesses, and we need to make it easier for businesses to pass from one generation to the next.
Tax concessions need to be offered and venture capital made available, because the life cycle of a business goes: founded, handed over and finally closed.
We need to give thought to all three phases in future.
Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mr Rübig for approaching his report with such an open mind and, of course, to agree that innovation concerns entrepreneurship and employment.
However, we need it not just to serve the economy, the knowledge-driven economy in today's society, we also need it to serve the knowledge-driven and cultural society.
Because innovation is not just an economic and business factor, it is also an educational and cultural factor.
More to the point, it is the result of mutual and complex actions and reactions between education, research, the administration and the public.
Innovative procedures presuppose a dynamic social model which is receptive to change.
In fact, innovation does not depend solely or exclusively on technological factors, it also depends on organisational factors.
A propitious environment is the main requirement, so that new initiatives, new discoveries and scientific applications can be developed, which is why we need social components working together, we need close cooperation between businesses and scientific institutions, as well as schools and universities, and we also need the help of the media if an innovative culture is to mature in our society as a whole.
Innovation must be the property of every member of society.
That is how our society will work in new directions, opening up new paths.
Europe needs an approach to innovation which will directly serve society as a whole.
However, we know that there are quite a few negative structural factors which prevent us from progressing as far as we should.
We are quite a way behind and I think that this is a bitter but honest admission, which is why we need the measures proposed in the report, together with suitable educational systems that nurture innovation.
Innovation is a process of analysis and synthesis and young people - mainly students - need therefore to play a part.
We must take care to ensure that we do not just inflict talk and chalk on young people and that they take an active part in the innovative process during their studies and both inside and outside school.
We must cultivate this approach at all levels of education.
It is important to have cross-disciplinary syllabuses in tertiary education.
We must bring the exact and the theoretical sciences close together, however difficult that may seem.
We must also understand that we need better penetration of university research institutes and of scientific libraries via the Internet.
I should like to highlight this sector in particular, because we are still a long way from having the really efficient network of libraries in Europe that is an absolute must.
Finally, we should take steps to provide better protection for intellectual property because this is what can invigorate and foster the incentive for our scientists to innovate.
That is why it is also extremely important for us to promote the application of European patent law.
Madam President, at last spring' s Lisbon Summit the Heads of State and Government set themselves an ambitious target.
The European Union was to become the most dynamic and the most competitive economic area in the world.
Innovation is the key to this.
It is the subject of an excellent report by Mr Rübig, whom I would expressly like to congratulate on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. His report is thorough and precise; it is creative and full of insights.
Only an innovation offensive will create the necessary conditions for making up the ground we have lost to the USA and Japan, preventing a mass exodus of researchers and finally achieving international competitiveness.
Specifically, it means changing our systems of education.
Young people must be able to be involved at an early stage, by teaching them science in schools and specifically encouraging their talents.
Curricula must include projects modelled on professional management, by forming junior enterprises, for example.
We need new information systems and higher technological qualifications in the training and further training of workers and students.
Mr Rübig has always been concerned with revitalising small and medium-sized enterprises.
His particular concern is important given that we have 18 million SMEs.
Workers are specifically asking for programmes to promote SMEs in the European Union because over 70 to 80 % work in that sector.
SMEs need simpler tax procedures, a dismantling of bureaucratic hurdles, and active support for innovative products and methods of production.
Research needs to be integrated into operating structures.
Access to start-up capital is essential, because young people need to be able to start new businesses, to become entrepreneurs.
They need to be able to take all the current problems of the new economy into account.
I hope we have all learned something from that.
On this basis, Madam President, the European Union will be able to make a sustained contribution to the high performance, knowledge-driven economy we are looking to achieve.
In Lisbon and Stockholm, it was decided that Europe should become the world' s most dynamic and competitive knowledge-driven economy.
Of the seventeen million companies in Europe, no fewer than 99 percent form part of the medium-sized and small business sector.
That accounts for more than 70 percent of employment, 50 percent of investment and 60 percent of the Union' s wealth.
As such, the medium-sized and small businesses are the most important economic factor in the European economy.
The competitiveness of these businesses very much relies on their innovative capacity.
At the moment, Parliament is working hard on the Sixth Framework Programme, in which the participation of SMEs must be guaranteed at the same - or, ideally, a higher - level.
I have therefore proposed to increase the budget available to SMEs to 15 percent from the current 10 percent.
But that participation of SMEs must, in the view of the Liberal Group, take place within themed programmes.
Indeed, in that way, it is guaranteed that large and small companies will join forces, for small companies do not have the expertise and manpower to go it alone.
It is not acceptable for most of the limited research budget that is available to be spent on the flanking policy in the Member States, for that is not a European task.
It is more important to simplify the participation of medium-sized and small businesses in the Sixth Framework Programme.
That is why the 'rules of participation' must be simplified and standardised so that research applications submitted by all Directorates-General for the Sixth Framework Programme as a whole can be dealt with more efficiently and more quickly.
I should like to conclude by giving you some food for thought: Europe is good at converting euros into research, but often fails in converting research into euros, and that must change in future.
Madam President, the Commission and the rapporteur are preparing for a more innovative Europe.
This report calls for the networks to be strengthened at European level.
This dissemination of gathered knowledge should not lead to less competition, which is another aspect of innovation, for what are the areas in which cooperation actually reinforces the ability to innovate?
Tax benefits are in any case not a very good incentive.
They fragment the market and can lead to a shift in activities to the cheapest region.
Market-oriented attraction is preferable.
The rapporteur also underlines the importance of education.
This is an area in which only the Member States have authority.
In this connection, it is not the international orientation or the mobility of education and research itself, but the results, that deserve recognition.
National initiatives promoting the innovative environment and acknowledging achievements will have to increase competitiveness.
The aspects that make European regions into an attractive environment in terms of innovation are the knowledge available, the labour market and other local factors.
A government should therefore have a vision of regional profiles it would like in future.
However, regional specialisms can be adversely affected either by tax measures or by uniform measures which are said to result in a loss of quality for Europe as a whole.
The Commission proposal is typified - more so than the report - by a realistic approach from the bottom upwards.
If necessary, a joint approach could play an additional role to promote networks.
In that way, the Union can back the measures which increase the Member States' ability to innovate, both individually and jointly.


Madam President, Commissioner, my colleagues, knowledge and know-how are the basis of economic competitiveness and of the well-being of society as a whole.
The ambitious objectives of Lisbon also threaten to remain so much rhetoric, and will perish like worldly honour, if the success of the European Union in global competition is not based on a high level of education and research.
There are several aspects relating to a comprehensive innovation policy, which many colleagues have already emphasised in their interventions.
As European legislators, we should pay particular attention to simplifying legislation and administration.
I subscribe to the view of Mr Rübig and of other colleagues, that simplification is a necessity.
Enterprise and development activity is excessively restricted by bureaucratic impediments, and small and medium-sized enterprises in particular suffer from this.
Besides some form of labour reform, we also need a complete administrative reform, which has already got off to a good start with the White Paper on administrative models.
As you, yourself, said a couple of days ago, our esteemed competitors the United States and Japan are further along the road of promoting and developing innovations than the EU; one of the reasons for this is that in those countries enterprise and risk-taking are rewarded to a significantly greater degree than in Europe.
We must create conditions which encourage self-starting and independent initiative.
Enterprise can be promoted early among schoolchildren and students.
All we need to do is to create the prerequisite conditions in our education systems, for example, in the form of a special business model which young businesses can then adopt.
I also regard the development of human capital as important.
It is a significant factor in innovation.
A genuine information society must be within the reach of all citizens, and so raising the level of know-how of the entire population is important.
The copyright of innovations must also be better protected; this has already been mentioned in other interventions.
Even before this, in the course of my work I have stressed the importance of adopting a Community Patent which will cover the entire area of the European Union. The Community Patent would offer complete Union-wide protection for new patents, at the same time significantly reducing the administrative costs of firms.
And last but not least: we need a revolution in thinking which would free us from orthodox thinking and modes of action.
We must create conditions which make it possible to produce a whole raft of new ideas, out of which we may perhaps develop that one breakthrough innovation.
New technology is not the key to a good future; we need non-conventional thinking in all fields, in firms as well as in public administration.
Madam President, Commissioner, with outstanding diligence and sometimes frightening consistency of purpose my fellow countryman Paul Rübig has again produced a report containing almost everything that is good and right.
For that very reason, I hope I may be allowed to question some of it.
We have been discussing why innovation is so important for the European Union.
The rapporteur has given a broad answer to that question.
We could of course ask him what innovation?
What innovation is most in demand at the moment?
Perhaps military technology so we can find Osama bin Laden quickly.
Is that the kind of innovation we mean?
Is it innovation in surveillance that will enable us to uncover sleepers in the future?
Or do we not need to define innovation?
With our European system of values, are we not concerned here with innovation in education, innovation in social learning?
And how will we get there?
Would it not be an innovation finally to know how much is spent on innovation?
Do you know, Commissioner?
I have tried to find out how much is invested in the future in a big country like the Federal Republic of Germany.
We know what is spent on administration, we know what is invested in transfer payments, but when it comes to investing in the future, nobody knows.
We all agree that there cannot be too much funding for investment, because that is really the only way to safeguard the future.
But the question is, what kind of a future?
Where are we heading?
And is not the time after 11 September actually an ideal time to question much that was simply only a fixation with technology and instead to initiate research into social innovation?
Has the time not now also come to free ourselves from old instruments like gross national product and bring the innovative instrument of a well being factor more into the centre?
Questions on a good report.
Nevertheless, once again congratulations, Paul!

Madam President, the role played by innovation in achieving the ambitious objectives set by the European Union in Lisbon has been mentioned by the rapporteur, whom I congratulate on his detailed report, and by previous speakers.
However, the importance of innovation to our economic and social development needs to be appreciated more both by the Member States and by the European Commission itself.
Delays in implementing innovative measures under the Structural Funds and the cancellation of resources are sad proof of the fact that innovation often gets no further than the drawing board.
So we need a decisive and coordinated policy which ensures that innovation penetrates our entire economic and social fabric and that our citizens' creative powers are give free rein.
That is why I should like to highlight the fact that this policy needs to be driven by the principle of equal opportunities.
For a start, I do not believe that innovation is the duty or preserve of the young, I believe it should affect all ages with lifelong learning and the other methods mentioned by previous speakers.
I would like to point out that we need to encourage women in their individual and collective efforts, such as setting up companies, and we need to encourage women's non-governmental organisations to take an innovative approach to social activities which have a positive impact on social cohesion and job creation.
Equal opportunities should also apply geographically, given the huge discrepancies between the regions of the European Union when it comes to innovation.
Both the European Union and the Member States should pay special attention to disadvantaged regions, which are usually the mountain and island areas of the Union.
With the lack of innovation in Europe compared with the United States and Japan, we need to get moving and mobilise our forces.
This means that the spirit of innovation must also drive the European Union's innovation management policy.
Special units, such as the unit set up to manage innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund, are a step in the right direction, they just need to be adequately staffed to make them effective.
The European Commission must also focus on disseminating the results of best practices, which is why pioneering methods need to be found, with much better penetration and efficiency than those available under past policies and both the Member States of the European Union and candidate countries must work with the European Union and take appropriate steps to disseminate best practices and adopt all the new models which account for the performance of the best countries.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Rübig, for an excellent report and the House for a debate displaying quality and commitment.
It is widely recognised that policies that foster innovation are an underlying determinant of economic growth.
I am particularly happy to present to you today the very latest findings of the EU' s innovation policy performance, namely the 2001 Innovation Scoreboard, which was compiled as a follow-up to the report last year.
The 2001 European Innovation Scoreboard gives us a starting point for the Union' s strategy to enhance its overall competitiveness, by providing a common measure of a country's performance using 17 indicators.
I would also like to say that I share the rapporteur' s opinion in underlining the importance of education and training, something that has been noted by other speakers.
One indicator called for in the report was added to the scoreboard to cover lifelong learning.
EU performance in terms of growth and the standard of living relative to the US and Japan highlights the key challenges that the EU faces in enhancing its competitiveness.
In the past twenty-five years, and apart from temporary cyclical fluctuations, the EU has not kept pace with the US in improving its standard of living.
The gap is now wider than it was a quarter of a century ago.
At the aggregate level, the gap in living standards can be attributed to two factors: two-thirds to the employment rate, which is lower, and one-third to productivity.
I will focus on the productivity gap.
Until the mid-1990s, the productivity gap between the EU and the US narrowed steadily.
In the second half of the 1990s, however, the rapid acceleration of productivity growth in the US again began to widen the gap.
Until the early 1990s, capital-intensive industries spearheaded productivity growth.
This changed in the mid-1990s, when research and innovation became the key determinants.
The industries that achieved the greatest productivity gains during the late 1990s were predominantly research-intensive.
The overall strategy for boosting competitiveness requires us to better combine Union and Member State efforts to develop more effective policies to foster and support innovation.
National innovation policies should be reinforced, developed, and take a more consistent approach across the EU.
This is why we need a regular benchmarking exercise to measure and compare the performance of EU countries, identify key areas of weakness and strength, and enable ourselves to design and fine-tune innovation policies accordingly.
Taking the EU as a whole, we still lag behind the US and Japan on most indicators.
We trail significantly in terms of private-sector investment in research and development.
Rapid increases in business research and development in Japan and the US since 1994 have widened the gap with Europe alarmingly.
US expenditure in this area is now 74% higher than in Europe.
Europe' s high-tech patenting activity is also too weak: US businesses apply for more high-technology patents in Europe than do European businesses.
Japanese patenting in Europe is almost as strong as US patenting.
This patenting imbalance is an area that requires urgent attention.
At individual Member State level, the picture is different.
I must say that, as regards many indicators, the best-performing EU countries are also world leaders, sometimes doing substantially better than the US and Japan.
I will give you some examples: the UK, Ireland and France, for example, are world-leading suppliers of science and engineering graduates; the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark are ahead in home Internet access; Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden lead in public research and development; and Sweden is well ahead in business research and development expenditure.
However, differences in innovation performance between Member States are still significant.
Countries such as Denmark and Finland, whose performance was already strong, continue to lead the field when measured by the innovation index, that is to say in terms of trends, not scoreboards alone.
Greece and Spain are rapidly catching up with the EU average, while starting from a relatively low base.
But change is important and positive.
The four largest EU economies (France, Germany, the UK and Italy) are improving, but at rates below the EU average.
A number of lessons can be drawn from these results.
The Union should: first, invest in education and training, as has been said here a few times; second, improve its performance in the high-tech sectors and promote entrepreneurship; third, help to step up business research and development by encouraging Member States to introduce or increase the necessary incentives; and finally, promote the use of technologies in all sectors of the economy, including public administrations.
I am pleased to see that several of these aspects are well covered by Mr Rübig' s report.
I believe this report will help to generate a consensus on the way forward.
This is necessary, as shown by the findings of the Innovation Scoreboard.
The report expresses Europe' s wish to reduce the Union' s innovation deficit and achieve the goal set at Lisbon and, hence, does a great deal to help improve the EU' s overall competitiveness.
I hope that there will be an opportunity to come back to these issues in the Commission' s 2001 Competitiveness Report, which will be presented in a few weeks' time.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Exhaustion of trade mark rights
The next item is the report (A5-0311/2001) by Mr Mayer, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the problem of the exhaustion of trade mark rights (SEC(1999)2033 - C5-0354/2000 - 2000/2187(COS)).
Madam President, I would like briefly to outline the underlying issues and the main points of my report.
The central statement is that the Commission is called upon to produce a detailed study of the possible implications of the transition to the principle of international exhaustion by 31 December 2002.
The Nera study presented by the Commission in 1999 fails to deal with this matter adequately.
A trade mark right has its effects only in the territory for which it was granted.
Community exhaustion applies to the Community mark and national marks when the holder of the right has put his product into circulation in the Community for the first time.
If the holder of the trade mark right puts his product into circulation outside the Community, the legal effects of the marks are not exhausted in the Community.
He can therefore prevent parallel importers from importing the product into the Community.
Because of the current Community-wide exhaustion regime he can therefore quote two different prices: a lower one for countries outside the Community and a higher one for the Community itself.
This split pricing policy, however, is not what the trade mark right is about.
The main purpose of the mark is to make the product distinguishable and familiar and to indicate a certain product quality.
We could also speak about the advertising effect.
The division of markets to the disadvantage of consumers in the Community cannot be the objective of granting a Community trade mark.
Neither is there anything in competition law to argue against parallel imports.
So why should it be possible to use trade mark rights to prevent them?
There is something wrong there.
We must do something to get back to more competition and lower prices for branded goods.
The same conclusion was reached in a study by the Swedish competition authority, as, too, did a discussion paper by the Irish competition authority.
A hearing before a Select Committee of the British House of Commons was also presented predominantly with arguments in favour of international exhaustion.
There is now an important new factor: the increasing amount of trade on the Internet.
The present exhaustion regime could hamper the development of e-commerce.
It is not in fact certain whether Internet sales with the subsequent dispatch of branded goods are permissible under trade mark law.
But legal certainty and consumer protection are essential conditions for the development of trade over the Internet.
Then there are the following points. There are a) trade marks that are not really matched to any particular product.
For example, you order 'a Siemens' .
'A Siemens' can be a lamp, a washing machine or a nuclear power station.
There are b) also trade marks that designate group products, for example Adidas shoes, whether they are sandals or high heels.
There are c) trade marks that require absolute identity, in medicine for example.
It cannot be even one milligram different from what the mark designates.
All these points are reason enough to call on the Commission to undertake its own comprehensive study.
Such a study must also draw comparisons with the world' s major trading nations and study and make a precise analysis of the implications for the EU labour market.
Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Mayer who, in spite of some extremely polarised positions, listened and put forward an alternative in the form of a proposal for further consideration, which met with everyone' s approval.
This position is all the more important and necessary since the report refers to the crucial problems related to globalisation and European integration.
In addition to the direct interests of consumers and manufacturers, the economic position of the European Union in world trade is at stake.
Some may be in favour of a total liberalisation of trade, whereas others, myself included, believe that the system of Community exhaustion responds to the need to develop the integration of the single market, a favourable way of supporting Europe in the face of global competition.
Apart from the concept of integration, the crux of this report is to support innovation, and God knows how much we have spoken about this in the previous report, to support innovation and creativity within the Community.
Trade marks are the most important and most efficient way of protecting intellectual property.
Trade marks provide the consumer with a guarantee of a product' s authenticity and quality, and they ensure pre-sales, shape investment and, consequently, creation.
A change in the system could lead to a drop in investment in research and development of European products and the impact on jobs could be significant.
The current system also provides the best means of protection against counterfeiting, as the channels used by parallel importers are often those used to transport pirate products.
In the studies that are currently available, and I stress the 'currently' , we found no relevant information enabling us to justify a change to the system, which could be detrimental to innovation.
I hope that the further consideration proposed by Mr Mayer will confirm this opinion.
Madam President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Mayer on the report he is presenting today.
I am perfectly aware that it is not the report he would have liked to approve and, although it is little consolation, I would like to say that I also would have preferred the report finally approved by Parliament to have been the one Mr Mayer initially drew up.
Despite the powerful interests concerned with preventing the world trade in trade mark products, the unusual report by a consulting company which states that consumers would not benefit immediately from the acquisition of goods at lower prices and the lukewarm position of the Commission which does not seem interested in seeking a solution to a problem which has a very negative effect on European consumers, the rapporteur, Mr Mayer, has been able to produce a report urging persistence in the quest for formulae which prevent manufacturers of trade mark products from maintaining excessively high prices on European markets.
When, in July 1998, the Court of Justice issued the Silhouette judgment, it caused great commotion in countries which recognised the principle of international exhaustion of the trade mark.
Either by law, as in Sweden for example, or by jurisprudence, as in my country, Spain.
Legally, the judgment is unassailable from the moment that it states that Article 7 of the Trade Mark Directive, by establishing the principle of Community exhaustion, indirectly establishes the prohibition of international exhaustion.
But this is a legalistic interpretation which does not prevent the recognition, as the judgment does, of the harmful effects for consumers of the fact that owners of trade marks can prevent the import of their own products if they originate from third countries.
The arguments used by those people who defend the prohibition of the international exhaustion of trade marks - combating counterfeiting, maintaining the prestigious image of goods, diversion of income from the manufacturer to the importer - are at odds with a reality which is demonstrated in the documents produced by the rapporteur.
When parallel imports from third countries are allowed, the prices of trade mark products drop.
The information provided on price increases in Germany, when the reform of German law prevented international exhaustion, is conclusive.
And although my experience is of little scientific value, I must point out that I have been able to note how, in the United States, a product which in Spain costs me EUR 10, costs me just EUR 1.5.
For all these reasons and despite the reservations involved in finding a consensus in favour of a more ambitious resolution, it is important that the Commission takes the initiative in favour of consumers and brings forward proposals to strengthen the world market, removing barriers to trade, which are not just customs barriers, but which often consist of anti-competitive practices by companies whose aim is to defend their own profits.
Madam President, Commissioner, I must say that I have not, unfortunately, read either the book No Logo or the special edition of The Economist entitled Pro Logo in The Economist.
Clearly, however, we have embarked upon a very interesting discussion of trade marks and their significance in terms of dividing up world markets.
Those of us who want to see a form of globalisation that is of benefit to all parties look forward to an international exhaustion of trade mark rights in accordance with the original Mayer report.
The same applies if one is in favour of an effective competition policy, as mentioned by the rapporteur, for European exhaustion as it is at present enables markets to be divided up, providing benefits to manufacturers but not to consumers.
Different studies can produce different results.
The Commission takes a relatively negative view of international exhaustion in its study.
On the other hand, we also have the experience referred to by the previous speaker whereby there are quite a few countries in which goods became more expensive after Community exhaustion had been introduced, for example Germany, Sweden and Great Britain.
I am also sorry that this matter could not have been taken further during the Swedish Presidency which, I know, accorded it a high priority.
I therefore hope that we shall now, in fact, produce a report on this subject. I also hope that the Commissioner can tell us what opportunities there are for addressing the issue in the context of the WTO in which a new round of talks is about to start.
I also think it is important not to confuse this issue with that of pirate manufacturing, which is a completely different matter.
There are new ways of checking the authenticity of goods by means of genuine and detailed identification, facilitating a completely new form of supervision.
I therefore hope that the Commission is able to support the endeavours representing the main approach taken by Parliament today, as well as by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
Madam President, at this hour brevity is a duty and not a virtue.
Although I was not a member of the committee which produced this report, I want to speak because my colleague, Mrs McCarthy, who was a member, is detained by the grave events now under discussion at our party conference in Brighton.
I am speaking as someone concerned with consumer affairs.
Like Mrs Thors, I was for a time the Chair of the Consumer Protection Intergroup.
Parliament's Rules do not allow us to express these opinions in the way we once did.
The substantial majority which Mr Mayer rallied in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was, of course, for a response which, as my colleague has said, was less than he would have wished.
It is also less than I would have wished and it should be less than this Parliament would have wished.
The principal recommendation here is for a further study of the consequences of a transition to the use of the principle of international exhaustion.
Fine, but how long is that going to take when a parallel importer can be prevented from giving the consumer a quality product at a price which benefits them both?
This is not like counterfeit products, as another speaker tried to suggest.
It is not competitive selling at a loss to weaken rival products, nor is it driving down the quality of those products.
It is a straightforward blockage of trade, which will not diminish the so-called grey markets but will make them more confused and complex.
We need this to be a study which tells us of the shady side of what proclaims itself to be a respectable trade.
I do not really expect more from the Commissioner tonight than I have heard from him privately.
However, the matter cannot rest here.
The Silhouette case was not the last word on all this and nor, as he would acknowledge, is Mr Mayer's report.
Nevertheless I salute him.
Madam President, this is an important subject and has been discussed at various places and at various times.
It is important that the exhaustion regime for Trade marks which the Community applies provides for a proper balance between the interest of consumer prices and protection of Trade mark rights.
It has been stated by those who advocate a change to the Community-wide exhaustion regime, that a unilateral change to international exhaustion of Trade mark rights would have a significant impact on consumer prices.
The Commission is not convinced that this would be the case.
According to the Nera study carried out by a consultancy firm based in London which was submitted to the Commission in February 1999, prices under international exhaustion would probably not be very different from those that are currently in force.
Mr Berenguer Fuster and the rapporteur have referred to alleged price increases in Germany of films, perfume and cameras.
As soon as this became known, the sectors concerned supplied statistics to the Commission to show that prices have not increased as was claimed, but have remained the same or in some cases even decreased.
The purported evidence concerning Germany is not what it seems to be and, in fact, supports the case that the Commission has put forward and not the case in favour of international exhaustion.
There has also been a price study carried out by the Swedish and the UK governments.
It is very interesting to note, and significant for this debate, that of the items where comparisons between the European Union and the United States were possible, the cheapest market was often within the European Union.
For some products, the United States was even the most expensive market.
Moreover, there were considerable price differences between Member States.
In general, prices in Germany and France were lower than in the UK and in Sweden.
Those differences exist within the European Union where there is regional exhaustion for Trade mark rights and not international exhaustion.
In other words, for all Member States of the European Union the same exhaustion regime applies yet there is a 40% price difference in electronic goods between Sweden and Germany.
This certainly goes to show that the internal market is not performing as it should be, but it also shows that the differences in prices have nothing to do with whether the exhaustion regime is regional or international.
The price differences within the European Union usually exceed the price differences between EU Member States and the United States.
In other words, the arguments in favour of the thesis that international exhaustion would lead to a decrease in prices is very tenuous.
In fact the Commission does not believe that evidence at all.
Furthermore, I should like to add that the price element is only one aspect of the exhaustion issue.
It is also very important to consider the legitimate interest of Trade mark holders in their home markets.
For many companies the Trade mark is their most valuable asset and that is not something we should take lightly.
Trade marks are also of value to consumers because they represent a sign of quality.
The Commission decided in May 2000 that there is no reason, at least for the time being, to propose any change to the current regime.
The Commission considers that there is now a proper balance between the interests at stake and that the current Community-wide exhaustion regime is an appropriate way to protect the legitimate rights of Trade mark holders.
The Commission has taken due note, obviously, of Mr Mayer's report and of the long and difficult discussions in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Many arguments have been put forward for and against a change of regime.
The Commission recognised all those arguments from previous discussions in other fora.
All the aspects mentioned have been thoroughly studied and analysed by the Commission services and in my view no new elements have been put forward which would require further examination or which would give the Commission reason to reconsider its decision.
Having said this, the Commission intends to monitor the question of exhaustion closely and will certainly take any action necessary should new and important reasons emerge to consider abandoning the current exhaustion regime.
In the meantime, the Commission is, of course, willing to share with Parliament our experiences concerning cases of possible abuse of Trade mark rights but in order to make the report more useful and balanced the Commission intends to take all relevant elements into consideration.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon on Wednesday.
(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have here before me a newspaper interview, from which I should like to read you an extract.
It reads 'I do not agree with the Anti-Slavery Conference in Durban.
It promotes a sense of victimisation in people who already feel like victims.'
It goes on to say: 'I am not happy with the whole Conference in Durban, quite apart from the way in which the Middle East was discussed and the fact that someone like Castro was applauded. These are indicators that this was an anti-western meeting' .
These are not my words, but those of a European Commissioner, namely Mr Bolkestein.
Last night in my group, our group chairman told me that Mr Nielson, on account of unfortunate statements he made concerning anti-American imperialism, will have to justify himself before the Conference of Presidents.
Would it not be fair, therefore, if you, in your capacity as President of the Conference of Presidents, were also to invite Mr Bolkestein, giving him the opportunity to explain before the Conference of Presidents these very unfortunate, extremely dangerous statements at a time when we, as the Western world, must join forces with the Islamic world to combat terrorism.
Mr Staes, I can confirm that Mr Nielson will be attending the Conference of Presidents and we shall consider your suggestion.
Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Finnish language programmes have been removed from Parliament' s television network.
We wondered why that was, but got no explanation for it.
There are therefore no programmes being broadcast from Finland, while some Member States can get three or even four channels.
Could I request the President to ask those concerned to correct the situation, as it is odd, particularly during these times of crisis, that one Member State' s programme signal should have been removed from the television network without any explanation.
Mr Paasilinna, due to absolutely exceptional circumstances, Mrs Banotti has unfortunately not yet arrived.
We shall, of course, inform her of your dissatisfaction and she will immediately find out what can be done.
Announcement by the President
The Court of First Instance has recently rejected the appeals lodged by Members of the European Parliament, the National Front and the Bonino List against Parliament' s decision of 14 September 1999 not to recognise the existence of the Technical Group of Independent Members.
In accordance with the provision of the order, the cases concerned were joined for the purposes of judgment and the appeals were rejected.
In each case, the applicants will bear their own costs and the costs of Parliament, including those incurred in the summary proceedings in case 222/99.
The judgment was delivered in open session in Luxembourg on 2 October 2001.
As a result, the suspensive order handed down by the President of the Court of First Instance on 25 November 1999 at the end of the summary proceedings lapsed when the judgment was delivered, in other words, on 2 October 2001, pursuant to Article 107(3) of the Court' s Rule of Procedure.
Therefore, Parliament' s decision of 14 September 1999 not to recognise the existence of the Technical Group of Independent Members is once again fully effective.
I shall of course give the floor to Mr Dell' Alba.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the eighteen MEPs belonging to the Technical Group of Independent Members have taken note of the judgment of the Court of First Instance on 2 October.
They point out that this judgment is somehow the inverse image of the order handed down by the President of the same court, who, on 25 November 1999, ruled that Parliament was obliged to recognise the legitimate existence of our group.
It stands to reason that we shall be appealing against yesterday' s decision and that, obviously, we ask for an interim order to suspend the effects of the judgment.
In this respect, Madam President, in order to avoid any misunderstandings, I ask you, before making further provisions to consult the Legal Services as to the effects of the suspension, which is what we shall ask the Court to do, as is within our rights.
Having said that, I would like to draw the attention of my fellow Members to two important aspects of yesterday' s judgment.
The first aspect is that our appeal is fully admissible and, therefore, MEPs are fully entitled to question the justice of actions of the European Parliament, such as these.
This was not what Parliament wished, as it had requested that the Court declare that this appeal should not be admitted.
The second aspect is that, on several occasions, the Court recognises that disparities do exist in the treatment of the Members of the European Parliament.
The Court mentions this in Paragraphs 201 and 57 of yesterday' s judgment.
I am not going to quote these paragraphs and I will simply say that the Court declared that Parliament must remedy these disparities, as part of its duties to manage internal affairs.
Mr Corbett, since your draft report on the reform of Articles 29 and 30, which aims to rectify these disparities has been held in abeyance for a year, we shall continue our fight, we shall be vigilant and we shall do everything within our power to ensure that we continue this fight to eliminate these disparities and that it does not cease as a result of yesterday' s judgment.
Madam President, I am delighted at the victory of Parliament at the Court of First Instance.
It confirms that we were right in the decision that we took.
Mr Dell'Alba, though, is also right to draw attention to the fact that we must ensure that there are no disparities or discriminations in our Rules.
That was the objective of the report of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs which we held in abeyance pending the judgment of the Court.
Perhaps now is the time for this report to come before the full House, but if there is to be an appeal and if - although I would personally doubt this - the full Court of Justice were to suspend the effects of the decision of the Court of First Instance until they themselves rule, that would put us in a difficult position with the report from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
Personally I doubt that the full Court of Justice would give such an ordinance giving a suspensive effect, in which case we can proceed immediately to look at the disparity that some people may feel exists in our Rules.
My report would, I am sure, go some way to reassuring people.
Mr Corbett, what I can say to you and Mr Dell' Alba is that, of course, if there is to be an appeal, I shall examine very closely, in conjunction with Parliament' s Legal Service, whether this appeal will have a suspensive effect.
We shall look into this matter extremely carefully.
Madam President, the judgment is very clear, but in a society governed by the rule of law there must, of course, be the right of appeal and the judgment must have no effects until such time as the highest court has reached its conclusion.
The judgment is also very clear when it comes to the duties of Parliament.
Among the grounds of the judgment, number 157 expressly states that it is Parliament' s duty, within the framework of its relevant internal procedures, to investigate whether the disparities in treatment of the two categories of Members arising from the aforesaid internal procedures are all necessary and, therefore, objectively justified.
This is, to speak plainly, a broad hint to us to examine our Rules of Procedure to see whether they are discriminatory.
I think that all MEPs and political units such as the Italian Radical Party must have completely equal opportunities.
They must naturally have the same political rights as the political groups, apart from a number of rights quite specific to the latter.
However, the rules need to be examined critically to ensure that political units have the same opportunities to work in Parliament.
I would therefore call upon you to request the legal services to go through the judgment carefully and see how we are to improve the Rules of Procedure in order to ensure complete equality.
I would also call for the judgment to be brought up at the first meeting of the Conference of Presidents to be held directly after such an investigation of the judgment has been carried out. In that context, we shall be able to debate a package of arrangements for independent MEPs and smaller political units which are not large enough to form a group and, in that way, be able to secure the fair treatment of MEPs.
Madam President, I must take this opportunity to inform you that a party of schoolchildren invited by me for this week - tomorrow to be precise - has cancelled the visit.
I also heard, however, that mine was not the only group affected, but that around half the invited groups had cancelled their visits this week.
The children in question, or their parents, fear that security measures in this House are inadequate and that the children would be in danger if they visited Parliament.
Let me request you, then, to supply the public with extensive information about the adequacy of the security arrangements.
Should this not be possible, consideration should be given to a general suspension of visits.
I myself have also another concern: I would welcome it if those visitors' quotas that cannot be made use of because visits have been cancelled, could be set aside for future dates rather than be lost, so that these groups that, for understandable reasons, are not visiting Parliament now, may make up for it at a later date.
The Bureau members will be meeting this evening and I shall inform them of your proposal.
Madam President, as regards the formation of Parliamentary Groups, our group expressed itself quite unambiguously at the time this Parliament was constituted.
We are grateful for this confirmation of our understanding of the law.
Further to certain remarks by Members, I would again like to make it clear that our Rules of Procedure, decided on by this Parliament, make a clear distinction between Members belonging to a group and pooling their rights in it, and those who do not belong to a group.
Members without a group should quite clearly not be discriminated against, but that does not mean that they, as individual Members, enjoy complete equality of treatment with the groups.
Rule 30 of our Rules of Procedure expressly states that Members not belonging to a group have the use of a Secretariat with all other details being decided on by the Presidents.
That is now the legal position as handed down by the Court of First Instance, and we should proceed in accordance with it in the coming months.
Extraordinary European Council of 21 September 2001 in Brussels - Preparatory work for the European Council in Ghent
The next item is the Council and Commission statements, firstly, on the Extraordinary European Council held in Brussels on 21 September 2001, and secondly, on the preparatory work for the European Council in Ghent.
I would like to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Michel, and I shall now give him the floor.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was keen to inform you as quickly as possible about the progress of the work done at the extraordinary European Council held on 21 September involving the Heads of State and Government of the European Union.
I felt that it was important to involve you, as MEPs, closely in the European Union' s talks and decisions, as we have done since the tragic events occurred.
As you know, the European Council met to analyse the international situation following the terrorist attacks in the United States and to give the necessary impetus to the actions taken by the European Union.
The talks rapidly led to unanimous conclusions, the text of which was made public on the evening of 21 September.
I do not intend to read it out here in its entirety, but I would like to emphasise the salient points.
I will first inform you that the presidency is most satisfied to see the European Union decide that the fight against terrorism is a priority, and to reaffirm its unyielding determination to take concerted action under any and all circumstances.
The terrorist threat is a test for European integration.
The unanimity displayed by the European Council, the quality of its debate, and the adoption of comprehensive and specific measures all show that the Union proved to be equal to the challenge.
The extraordinary Council gave the Union an opportunity to get several important messages across.
The first message is one of solidarity and cooperation with the United States.
The European Union shares the same values as the United States: those of an open, democratic, multi-cultural society.
The Union will stand alongside the United States to bring to justice the perpetrators of these barbarous acts, together with their sponsors and accomplices, and to ensure that they are punished.
We are of the opinion that the targeted American reprisals are legitimate under Security Council Resolution 1368.
We are prepared to commit ourselves to this line, each Member State according to its means.
However, we must not underestimate the seriousness of this scourge.
If we are to succeed, we must have the backing of a broad coalition, under the aegis of the United Nations.
This coalition would include candidates for EU membership, the Russian Federation and our Arab partners.
The second message that the European Union would like to get across following this Council is that it is fully committed to fighting terrorism, and to this end has adopted an action plan comprising five series of measures.
The first series of measures consists of bolstering essential police and judicial cooperation.
To this end, the European Council has set a number of objectives, including the creation of a European arrest warrant and the establishment of a common definition of terrorism.
The same European Council has also taken a firm decision to adopt measures for identifying terrorists and the organisations that support them in order to draw up lists of terrorist organisations.
In this connection, the role of Europol and its cooperation with the United States will be reinforced.
The second series of measures in the action plan, which I consider to be very important, involves the development of international legal instruments.
There are many such instruments that need to be implemented and it would no doubt be worthwhile examining, as India suggests, the idea of a general convention against international terrorism.
The third series of measures on which the European Union would like to work involves the funding of terrorism.
Here too, specific action will be taken at EU level, particularly with regard to money laundering and the freezing of assets.
The fourth series of measures involves air safety.
The European Union intends to swiftly devise a set of specific, technical measures for this purpose, such as baggage checks, technical training for crews and so on.
Lastly, I wish to draw your attention to the fifth series of measures, which involves the common, foreign and security policy as a whole.
The emphasis has been placed on the need to coordinate the Union' s overall action; the idea being to bolster the common, foreign and security policy, in order for there to be an integrated campaign against terrorism, including the systematic reassessment of relations between the European Union and third countries in the light of any support that these countries might give to terrorism.
In the medium and long term, the fight against terrorism will also require the Union to strengthen its prevention policy and to become more involved in stabilising regional conflicts.
As part of this, the European Union certainly intends to enhance its role, with the assistance of the United States, Russia and its partners in Arab countries, in order to work towards finding a long-term solution to the Middle East conflict.
In addition, the development of the common, foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the European security and defence policy (ESDP) could have long-lasting effects.
These EU policies must not be used as tools for reprisals, but as a means of prevention.
Conflict prevention also implies an unstinting commitment on the part of the European Union to integrate all countries into a global system of security and sustainable prosperity.
Finally, we must pay special attention to the problem of refugees.
On this issue, the Commission will devise projects to assist Afghan refugees in neighbouring countries.
The last message sent by the European Council was to reassure the European countries and the markets about the economy, and it will be helped in this endeavour by the conclusions of the informal ECOFIN Council held at the same time in Liège, and to stress the positive role the euro will play in this economic context that we are experiencing.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is the content of the message of the European Council held on 21 September.
To sum up, I would like to add two comments.
First of all, as is so often the case, the crisis situation created by the attacks in New York and Washington has given impetus to European unification.
The Extraordinary European Council on 21 September provided an opportunity to take practical decisions and to display genuine European leadership.
The Belgian Presidency will endeavour to follow up its commitments, particularly at the forthcoming General Affairs Council in October and the Ghent European Council.
Secondly, while making the fight against terrorism a priority, we must not be diverted from other projects that are fundamental to European integration.
I would like to confirm here and now that the Belgian Presidency will make every effort to comply with its programme on preparing for the introduction of the euro, enlargement negotiations and the implementation of the European security and defence policy.
I would now like to turn to the preparation of the Ghent European Council.
(NL) The informal meeting of Heads of State and Government in Ghent on 19 October will consider the three subjects already identified by the Belgian Presidency, namely the euro, the enlargement of the European Union and the Laeken Declaration on the future of Europe.
In the wake of recent international developments, a fourth issue will probably be added to the agenda, namely the fight against terrorism.
With regard to the introduction of the euro coins and notes in 12 Member States on 1 January 2002, the President of the ECOFIN Council, Minister Reynders, the relevant European Commissioner, Mr Solbes, and the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Wim Duisenberg, will present a detailed report on the level of preparedness of the Member States.
The Heads of State and Government will thus have an opportunity to influence preparations, where necessary. They will also have the opportunity to discuss some of the more political aspects of the euro, such as the use of the euro in the candidate countries.
With regard to the preparations for the Laeken Declaration, the President of the General Affairs Council will report on the talks held to date by the foreign affairs ministers on this subject.
In particular, the focus will be on the work done in this connection by the Belgian Presidency. The progress made to date mostly concerns the organisation of the Convention as an innovative instrument paving the way for the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004.
The Belgian Presidency hopes to be able to consolidate this progress at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 and 9 October and then build on it with regard to two additional aspects: the status of the candidate countries at the Convention and the organisation of a Civil Forum.
What is more, the presidency would like to see a consensus reached on the best way of defining the Convention' s mandate.
The presidency would prefer to develop further or to reformulate the four themes of the Nice Declaration, with, of course, the objective of arriving at a broader agenda.
At the General Affairs Council of 8 October, the presidency will also give the Member States an initial indication of the possible structure of the Laeken Declaration.
The preparatory work done in the General Affairs Council should make it possible for the Heads of State and Government meeting in Ghent to push ahead gradually with the plans for the Laeken Declaration and, if possible, to make further progress in this domain.
Consequently, over the coming weeks, the presidency will strive, firstly, to convince the other Member States that the Laeken Declaration should not be limited simply to procedural matters; secondly, to explain the nature of the new elements affecting the Declaration' s content and, thirdly, to persuade the other Member States that this approach, in substance, should not pose any specific problems.
(FR) I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to reassure all those who have expressed reservations regarding the approach being recommended by the presidency.
The type of undertaking that we envisage does not give rise to insurmountable obstacles. On the contrary, it offers up a number of advantages.
In my view, the question of knowing whether or not it is advisable to stick to the four topics of the Nice Declaration is not a genuine problem.
This declaration was worded in such a way so that it is possible to widen the debate, using the four topics listed as a basis.
Moreover, it is difficult to see what could prevent the Convention from taking the initiative on whatever subject it feels it would be useful to discuss.
It has been clear since our meeting in Genval that the Laeken Declaration will simply ask the questions and will not necessarily seek to give any pre-prepared answers.
The outcome of the Convention will be presented in the form of options, which should reassure all those who felt that their hand was being forced.
Lastly, while the aim of the exercise - which was acknowledged by all - is to ask the right questions, it is quite legitimate to seek to formulate them in the most complete, clear and pertinent manner in order to optimise the future work of the Convention.
Where the enlargement of the European Union is concerned, the European Council will be asked by the presidency to consider a report drafted by the European Commission on the implementation of a specific enlargement strategy.
This report will be available as soon as it is adopted by the college.
The aim in this respect is to check that the road map adopted by the Nice European Council and confirmed by the Göteborg European Council as a general framework for negotiation is being respected.
Lastly, I would like to stress that the presidency has no intention of drafting any written conclusions for the meeting of the Heads of State and Government.
I would like to thank Mr Michel.
I shall now give the floor to Mr Michel Barnier, who is speaking on behalf of the Commission.
Madam President, Minister Michel, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission and its President, Roman Prodi, who is currently in Brussels attending the European Union meeting with Russia, I would like to make a statement on the recent Extraordinary European Council held in Brussels and the opportunities arising from the preparatory work of the Ghent European Council.
Before I speak about the three subjects that Minister Michel also mentioned, which will be on the agenda of the Ghent Council, I would like to briefly talk about the Extraordinary European Council held on 24 September, in the wake of the tragic attacks on New York City and Washington.
As you know, this Council was, first of all, an opportunity to unanimously express our shared sadness and solidarity with the American people.
However, looking beyond these events, whilst we too experience this sadness and solidarity, I want to reassert our belief, and that of the Commission as a whole, that the fight against terrorism is not and cannot be a clash of civilisations.
On the contrary, it is this fight that brings together all the nations of the world, as equal partners, against the forces that set out to destroy them, without regard for human life, without any respect for the values that people share and that transcend borders and cultures. And it is the concept of humanity on which the European Union bases its action.
This is how our collective, global fight will achieve its goal.
At the Extraordinary Council, the European Union outlined the main points of a common response to the threat of terrorism, a threat that is unfortunately not unfamiliar to some of our Member States and which the Heads of State and Government now wish to combat together, using every possible means.
At the informal meeting at Ghent, the Commission will report back on developments in the economic situation, and more generally, on the various measures that were put forward on 21 September by the European Council.
The Laeken European Council will provide an opportunity to give a more detailed operational report.
In the coming months, the European Union must demonstrate that it is able to organise, take action, react swiftly and, of course, respect the fundamental freedoms, because this situation forces us, once again, to reconcile freedom and security.
The most urgent measures, on which my colleague Mr Vitorino is working, include the introduction of a European arrest warrant to replace current extradition procedures and the adoption of a common definition of terrorism.
I would point out that the Extraordinary European Council hoped to implement all the measures decided by the European Council at its meeting in Tampere in October 1999.
With the same determination, the Commission yesterday referred to you, Madam President, a draft Community regulation enabling us to freeze the assets of individuals or bodies that may have links with terrorism.
The Laeken European Council will therefore be a good opportunity to assess very carefully the progress made on creating the area of freedom, security and justice laid down at Tampere.
In the meantime, the European Parliament and the Council will be able to make initial progress due to several measures.
In October, the Commission will present the biannual performance indicators, which enable us to monitor the follow-up of the Tampere Council.
Ladies and gentlemen, let there be no mistake: whether it be regarding these matters and the other measures announced in Brussels on 21 September, the funding of terrorism, which I have just mentioned, the situation of air transport or the aid that we must give to the Afghan refugees, the European Union has a duty to achieve results, first and foremost to the Afghan refugees, who are expecting some progress to be made.
I would like to reaffirm my belief that the most effective means of bridging what we call the democratic deficit is most certainly to respond to citizens' expectations and to follow up our words with actions.
I shall now move on, if I may, to discuss the forthcoming informal Ghent Council and to the first of the subjects on the agenda, which relates to the major challenge of the euro and the introduction of euro banknotes and coins.
In less than three months, the euro will be here.
It is crucial to constantly reiterate, to everyone we speak to, the reasons why the majority of Member States of the European Union took the decision to share the same currency.
The euro is a political and economic undertaking; for almost three years, we have kept inflation under control and have had sustained growth because of economic and monetary union.
The euro will provide the European Union with better protection against external economic forces and against international financial crises.
Now is also the time to reiterate this.
This is an achievement, and we can all weigh up the extent of our achievement.
By using the euro on a daily basis, people, private individuals and businesses will benefit from the greatest transparency in prices, easier transactions and better investment opportunities.
They will gain a better understanding of what an internal market can offer, one that is made up of almost 400 million citizens and consumers, 300 million of which will use the single currency.
From 1 January 2002, the euro will, undoubtedly, make Europe more tangible, more visible than ever, and I believe that the circulation of the euro notes and coins will show in a very specific manner that the people of Europe are managing to achieve their common goals.
The euro will therefore become a symbol of stability, peace and shared identity.
Yet, when faced with such challenges, we must also hope and ensure that the changeover to the euro notes and coins is as straightforward as possible for 300 million people in 12 countries, when so many new methods of payments are introduced, along with 15 billion notes and 50 billion coins.
In other words, we must ensure that we meet this unprecedented logistical and strategic challenge.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has shown that it is playing an active and willing role to prepare for the introduction of the euro, and that it is concerned that consumers and businesses, from the largest to the smallest, receive the information they need.
With the support of the European Union, Member States have put in place national plans for the changeover to the euro.
Next week, my colleague, Pedro Solbes, will present a communication on the introduction of notes and coins, so that, in Ghent, the Heads of State and Government can put the finishing touches to the preparatory work that is underway.
The European Union, working together, must ensure that this information is circulated as far and wide as possible in order to respond to the concerns that exist, and which are having a noticeable effect on price stability, and to force us to collectively resolve any technical issues in an accurate and practical manner.
The second subject which Mr Michel raised, and which the Heads of State and Government will bring up in Ghent, is preparations for enlargement.
The Heads of State and Government will discuss enlargement because it is important to keep up the strongest possible political momentum for this project, whatever technical difficulties we encounter in relation to any particular aspect.
In any case, politically we are already living in an enlarged Union.
This has been made even clearer from our intensive contacts with the candidate countries since 11 September.
In Nice, last December, the Intergovernmental Conference defined the minimum parameters that will enable the Union institutions and bodies to take in new Member States.
Moreover, the European Council approved the strategy we had proposed for bringing the accession negotiations to a successful conclusion.
These decisions unequivocally confirmed that enlargement is an irreversible process.
We now have to implement, on a day-to-day basis, the road map the European Council adopted at Nice, based on the principle of differentiating between candidate states.
We have to evaluate the progress made at each accession conference separately, which will in fact also enable those candidate states that are currently less advanced to catch up.
In Ghent, the Commission will report on the progress made with the road map, presenting a kind of mid-term review of enlargement strategy, that will allow the Heads of State and Government to determine what kind of approach or impetus is needed for the further negotiations.
In mid-November, the Commission will publish the regular reports in which it evaluates the progress of the candidate states towards accession.
Let me say a last word on this subject.
We know that enlargement is a difficult project, but we also want it to be a very ambitious one.
It will succeed only if it enjoys the support of the people of all the countries concerned, by which of course I mean the candidate countries and their citizens, but also the citizens of the present EU Member States.
At the instigation of Mr Günther Verheugen, and in liaison with the European Parliament, the Commission has proposed measures for informing the citizens of the present and future Member States and explaining the issues involved, the chances and the opportunities, without, however, concealing the problems or risks of enlargement.
To that end we want to mobilise the Commission delegations in the candidate countries and our representatives in the Member States.
But everyone must play their part, the institutions and the European elected representatives, as also the national authorities and, more broadly, all the opinion-formers in Europe.
Madam President, let me raise a last point, which will be debated in Ghent, prior to Laeken, and concerns the future of the Union.
The Heads of State and Government will have to extend and confirm the positions defined at the recent foreign ministers' meeting in Genval.
Obviously this is the same subject the foreign ministers will or may debate in Luxembourg on 8 October.
In Genval, the Commission reported on the situation and called for a new approach in the preparations for the future institutional reforms, taking account of the limitations of the methods applied in the past, for Amsterdam and Nice.
For a long time, in fact, the European Parliament and the Commission had shared the interest shown by several Member States in a method inspired by the convention that prepared for the Charter of Fundamental Rights and brought it to a successful conclusion.
The Commission obviously hopes the next General Affairs Council will formally mark the support of all the Member States for this formula.
Let me just point out here that at a very early stage the Commission highlighted the importance, in view of preparing the future institutional reforms, of involving the various sources of democratic legitimacy that coexist in Europe and of preparing for these reforms as openly and transparently as possible.
That is why we would also like to see special attention devoted to establishing a structural link between the activities of the convention and the future Intergovernmental Conference.
Another link we would like to see is between the activities of the convention and the more general debate that will continue to be held and in which a growing number of associations, interest groups and citizens is already taking part.
This forum on the future of the Union, for which more and more people are perceiving the need, should encourage an exchange of views that very closely reflects the concerns of civil society.
I believe the convention must listen carefully to these discussions.
As to the procedures for organising this future convention, several questions still need to be resolved before the Laeken European Council.
Let me note here the very thorough work done by your Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs, especially in the report by Mr Leinen and Mr Méndez de Vigo.
This report very carefully and skilfully analyses all the questions at issue.
It also discusses something I consider most important, namely how to consolidate and deepen the Union's policies.
Like the rapporteurs, I too would conclude by emphasising the need to maintain the link between the institutional architecture and the European projects.
It would be rather paradoxical to try to strengthen Europe's institutional structure, to strengthen the Community model, while at the same time weakening the major, or some of the major Community policies or allowing them to 'unravel' .
The four main themes identified in Nice must be tackled.
I listened very carefully to Mr Michel's very coherent and, I think, ambitious words on how to consolidate the achievements of 50 years of European integration.
That could mean that when the environment itself changes we have to make changes to the course of European integration, although without losing sight of its points of reference or its raison d'être.
We will have to keep to a simple and effective decision-making system, but also strong common policies.
For the European Union cannot confine itself to producing legislative rules.
Through political union, through economic and monetary union, and also through certain major common policies such as the one for which I am responsible, cohesion, European integration must lead towards solidarity between peoples and nations, the stability of the continent, the balanced development of its entire territory and its regions.
It is these principles and these common objectives that we must reaffirm at this moment in time when it appears so necessary for Europe to stand united beside our closest allies.
When the Heads of State and Government meet in Ghent, they will certainly discuss the future Laeken declaration.
So I would like to conclude by emphasising that the Commission attaches great importance to this Laeken declaration, which should in a sense set the tone and determine the spirit in which, as Mr Michel just said, we need to approach all the institutional questions, so as to ensure that our institutions are in a position to achieve our common goals.
Moreover, ladies and gentlemen, since we have some time at our disposal before the year 2004, rather more than usual for a change, which is rare, no doubt we can and, I believe, we must spend some of that time reflecting together on what we want to do together, checking that we really do agree among ourselves on what we must and can do together and, of course, integrating this fundamental political reflection process into today's new and grave international context, which emphasises and underpins the necessity, the value and the relevance of the European project.
(Applause)
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September have changed the world, the drama of which event is shown by the way yesterday Article 5 (the assistance clause) of the North Atlantic Treaty was invoked for the first time in the history of the North Atlantic Alliance, thereby declaring that all NATO countries were required to engage in defence.
It is important, though, to point out that this challenge has been thrown down not only to the United States and the West but also to the community of nations as a whole.
I was told yesterday by someone from China - the People's Republic, not Taiwan - that fifty Chinese people were killed in New York.
That means to say that these terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center were an attack on nearly all the nations of the world.
It is therefore necessary that we act in solidarity with each other.
Getting to grips with terrorism is an intellectual, political, economic and military task, and it can only be done in the long term.
We say again that terrorism, in so far as its causes lie in Islamic lands - for that is where the terrorists are - is not to be confused with the peaceful Arab and Muslim world.
This must be repeated again and again!
I thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for travelling to many countries in the company of Mr Solana and Mr Patten.
We will now also - Madam President, I thank you for your initiatives - be calling a meeting of the Mediterranean Forum, in order to consult with our parliamentary friends from the Mediterranean region.
I would counsel strongly against any inappropriate rhetoric!
I am not satisfied with what was said by Mr Nielson or by Mr Bolkestein.
We must be able to rely on a Commissioner' s speaking appropriately and in cautious terms.
We will discuss this on Thursday in the Conference of Presidents and, subject to the way these discussions go, our group reserves the right to call upon the President of the Commission and, if need be, the two Commissioners to elaborate here in the European Parliament on what they have said.
We now need more of Europe.
We will be no more than a partner of the USA even if we are capable of dealing not only with foreign, security, and defence policy, but also with internal security issues.
We need to cooperate with Russia.
We welcome the fact that President Putin is having talks today with Mr Verhofstadt as President-in-Office of the Council and with Mr Prodi as President of the Commission.

We want partnership with Russia, but the events of 11 September must not mean that we close our eyes to the human rights violations that are still going on in Chechnya. On the contrary, we must say 'Yes' to combating violence and terrorism if it originates in Chechnya, but 'No' to war on the Chechen people.
We must also be an advocate for the rights of the Chechen people, within the Russian Federation of course.
For this reason, there must be recognition for the identity of peoples, which is one of the core values of the European Union.
It goes without saying that we must proceed with the World Trade Agreements as planned, for nothing could be worse than for us not to transact our normal day-to-day business.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned Ghent.
We support what you have said.
We ask you to send out a signal for renewed close cooperation in combating terrorism.
Not only should Europol and Eurojust, too, closely cooperate, but - in my personal judgment - this close cooperation is best guaranteed by their being based at one location.
We ask you to send a signal to the acceding countries, that they are welcome in the European Union if they comply with the conditions.
I am saying this as a German, for eleven years ago, on 3 October 1990, we were celebrating the unity of Germany, which was only possible because the road towards it was prepared by those Europeans who now wish to join the European Union.
What you have said about the preparation for the Laeken Convention meets with our approval.
Let me express my gratitude for the way your conception of it coheres with our own.
My final remark will be a personal challenge to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as much as to anyone else. We are all facing a challenge as regards the security of our institutions.
I must tell you that I feel safer here in Strasbourg - which has nothing to do with the place itself - but because we know that, here, the police are French.
When the President of the European Parliament gets a response from the Belgian authorities to the effect that greater protection for Parliament in Brussels is not necessary because there are no indications of attacks or such like, I find that justification far from adequate...
(Applause)
... but I call upon you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to have the European Parliament in Brussels more securely guarded by the security forces of the Kingdom of Belgium.
I am given to over-reaction even less than I am to panic, but we need protection and security wherever possible.
I ask you, in your capacity as the currently responsible President-in-Office of the Council to use your influence with the Belgian government so that the security of the European Parliament in Brussels may, so far as possible, be assured by Belgium.
(Applause)
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialist Group endorses the conclusions reached at the Extraordinary European Council at Brussels.
The Council came at just the right time politically, and resulted in a sea change in the Union' s collective conscience.
I should like to recall that this change was initiated by the Watson Report in early September.
Unfortunately, it was not until after the attacks on Washington and New York that the Council woke up to the situation and began to press ahead, and we do welcome the change in approach.
I should like to emphasise that in our view it is very important for this action to be included in the framework of United Nations' Resolution 1368 (2001), as stated in the Council' s conclusions.
Kofi Annan' s proposal to establish a global convention against terrorism is also important. It is already under discussion in the United States and will receive the European Union' s full support.
Global responses to the globalisation of terrorism are called for.
However, in addition to this universal approach, there is a need to express solidarity with the United States. Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty was therefore invoked yesterday.
A clear definition at all levels of the nature of the fight against terrorism is also needed. This fight will not curtail freedoms, it is a fight to defend the intrinsic freedom of every individual, namely the right to life and the right not to be subjected to indiscriminate violence.
In this connection, Madam President, I believe the activities of the Justice and Home Affairs Council must be supported, as it works to consolidate both Europol and Eurojust. Common instruments must be developed, not only at European level but also within our respective countries.
In this connection I feel it should be pointed out that Parliament can come under pressure from lobbying groups. This is already happening.
The lobbying groups are very adept at exerting pressure or influence on the Commission and the Council. Please take note of this, Mr President, and pass it on to Mr Verhofstadt as President-in-Office of the Council.
I believe we should respect the activities of others.
I have in mind, in particular, the criticism of our activities in connection with the directive on money laundering.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should also like to express my group' s disquiet concerning the legislation passed by the Italian Senate yesterday.
It is entirely contradictory to your aims, and will hinder judicial cooperation and the fight against terrorism because its provisions make cooperation at judicial level quite impossible.
(Applause from the left and protests from the right) Madam President, I must appeal to my colleague Mr Poettering ...
Surely, Madam President, this is a civilised House and those who resort to barracking have no place in it.
I am addressing my colleague Mr Poettering too. He is very concerned about the statements made by certain Commissioners.
My group would like all Commissioners to explain themselves before this House.
Mr Poettering ought to confer with his political friends, especially with the Prime Minister of Italy, to ensure that no statements are made to undermine the European Union's action here and in the wider world.
In addition, Madam President, I should like to comment on the Ghent Council.
The measures taken so far concerning the euro are good, and it is an important issue.
However, we need to strengthen our economic capacity so we can respond to the world crisis. It is for the Council to do so, because it is essential for us to define an anticyclical policy and put it in place.
Further, with regard to enlargement, and here I am addressing all the political groups in this House, we must make a commitment on the basis of what you achieve at Ghent, and of the Commission' s progress report.
This has to come back to Parliament. I should like to highlight one point.
There is a lot of talk of progress along the road, and about the road map. However, we need to check whether the road and the road map will eventually lead to the same destination and whether it will be possible to comply with Parliament' s request that the countries involved should participate in the 2004 elections.
In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to make three comments on the Convention. Firstly, I understand that the Convention has already been adopted.
Secondly, the Convention is to be established on the basis of its composition when preparing the Charter.
Thirdly, when you refer to options, are you not speaking of coherent proposals by the Convention?
The Convention is not a research body, nor is it a seminar.
The Convention is required to present proposals. The latter sometimes involve two options, but they are never options to be accepted or rejected.
We do not wish to be involved in that kind of game.
(Applause from the left)
Madam President, the Liberal Democrats in this House welcome the decisions of the extraordinary European Council.
We are pleased that it took on board proposals from this House in the field of justice and home affairs on combating terrorism and indeed that it reviewed the Union's policies in other areas to ensure that we have joined-up thinking in our approach to this very serious problem.
We regret, however, that it took a shock like the bombing of the Twin Towers and the Pentagon to push the Union into using the legal powers that it has under the Treaty of Amsterdam to act in fighting terrorism.
Liberal Democrats welcome particularly the Commission's proposals of yesterday for a Council Regulation to freeze the assets of terrorist groups.
We note its request for urgency and will be pushing this morning within the committee I have the honour to chair to make a recommendation to Parliament this afternoon to adopt those proposals.
I hope that the Committee of Permanent Representatives meeting this morning will add its request for urgency to that of the Commission.
The need for action in this area throws into sharp relief the weaknesses and the contradictions of the European Union post-Amsterdam.
These were not dealt with properly at Nice.
I hope they will be dealt with at Laeken and through the convention which will be established.
Commissioner Patten yesterday rightly lamented the inability of the European Union to act fast in situations like this and thus to enjoy the confidence of its Member States and to coordinate the policies of its Member States in an area where a supranational threat requires a supranational response.
At times like this the Union must act fast, but finds it cannot act fast.
The mechanisms of the third pillar leave Mr bin Laden laughing all the way to the cash machine.
I challenge the national governments to explain to our citizens why Europe has been incapable of acting fast because of the curious and complicated mechanisms of the third pillar.
When we act fast we find that we need urgency and urgency frequently leads to bad law.
We cannot continue to adopt the necessary security measures for our citizens in a way which is infelicitous for the Union's institutions, incomprehensible to our citizens and ineffective because it allows for no proper legal, democratic or administrative control of decisions.
I hope that the convention set up by Laeken will look at invoking Article 42 of the TEU to bring these policy areas fully within the core competences of the Union.
Many measures will be needed in the coming months.
Commissioner Vitorino has provided us with an anti-terrorism road map outlining such measures.
Clearly, in our consideration of these, a delicate balance will need to be struck between the security needs of our citizens and the civil liberties which make our democracy what it is.
The President-in-Office said this morning that we should not be blown off course on our other agendas.
I agree with him.
Those agendas include our agenda to consolidate citizens' rights within the Union and our agenda of anti-discrimination.
Liberals in this House will defend, with the President-in-Office, the rights of EU citizens.
The House has received a proposed regulation on the freezing of assets.
That regulation could potentially, depending on its implementation, have a disastrous effect on many legitimate Muslim-owned businesses.
Therefore Liberals will be calling for a sunset clause in that regulation giving it a limited life to make sure that it is not being abused in its implementation.
We look forward to proposals from the Council for the involvement of the European Parliament in determining the names that will be put on the list in the annex to that regulation.
In conclusion, Article 6 says that the Union is founded on rights.
The Charter defines those rights and we hope that the convention will agree to insert the Charter fully into the Treaties.
Commissioner, the European Union is facing several major challenges, which it will have to meet as quickly as possible if it wants to mount an effective, coherent and long-term campaign against terrorism, with particular reference to breaking up the terrorist networks.
Several colleagues have already discussed the first challenge, namely to avoid a clash of civilisations with the Islamic world.
In that context, let me take advantage of Mr Michel's presence and congratulate him on his diplomatic activity over the past weeks, which, I believe, is bound to produce positive results in terms of establishing a very broad coalition against terrorism and its supporters.
Creating a very broad coalition means, of course, securing the participation of as many countries as possible, but without losing sight of the fact that our enemies' enemies are not always our friends and realising that no state that forms part of this coalition is exempt from its duties in regard to democracy, the protection of human rights and respect for minorities.
I am thinking in particular of Russia and China, which are of course important players but also cause us serious concern in this respect.
The second challenge, and it is certainly not insignificant, is to strengthen police and judicial cooperation without compromising individual rights and freedoms.
In fact here, in the European Union, the parliamentary control is totally inadequate.
I therefore think, and I believe we agree fairly unanimously, that it is important to include judicial and police cooperation in the first pillar.
That would certainly be one answer.
Furthermore, at international level, we urgently need to set up the International Criminal Court, a process that has been underway for several years but is now marking time.
Let me point out that we vitally need this kind of court to try crimes against humanity, such as those committed in New York and Washington.
We will have to mount a large-scale diplomatic action to persuade as many states as possible to support this project, in particular the United States, which is after all a vital player.
The third challenge is the problem of depriving the terrorist networks of their means of action, both financial and technical.
We have already raised the subject of financing; we have a draft directive on money laundering that is currently making little progress and I think an effort needs to be made in the dialogue between the Council and Parliament to ensure that this directive is adopted quickly.
Moreover, we must realise that this is a first step; it does not go far enough but it is a determining step. In the long term, I am convinced we will be forced to take large-scale action to outlaw and abolish offshore banking and tax havens.
Money laundering is obviously an important weapon in the hands of international terrorist groups and international terrorist networks.
I was struck by some information, which has not been denied, to the effect that even before the New York and Washington attacks it appears that shares in some companies - and I am thinking in particular of the two American airline companies and several insurance companies that were affected by the attack - were jettisoned just before the attacks.
This could be regarded as insider dealing and I think that at the very least we need an international inquiry to check this information.
Finally, let me turn to the technical level, technical being, of course, a euphemism for arms. Clearly the European Union will have to intensify its fight against illegal and uncontrolled exports of light arms and keep a close eye on the fundamental problem of the proliferation of chemical and bacteriological weapons.
I believe that we cannot avoid the need to take a longer-term look at the vulnerability of some of our technological tools to acts of terrorism.
I am thinking, for example, of energy, of the risks posed by nuclear power stations, the majority of which are highly vulnerable to the types of action committed in the United States.
Madam President, once again, we declare our condemnation of any form of terrorism, whatever its source.
As well as destroying human life, terrorism takes any possibility or capacity for democratic initiative away from the huge numbers of men and women who are fighting to change the unjust social and economic system of this world.
Moreover, we condemn any attempt to assert the non-existent superiority of the moral, cultural or political systems of the communities of the European Union over other communities.
We believe that, at this moment in history, one of the ways in which the European Union can combat and isolate any form of violence is to make a concerted effort to achieve the objective of giving the peoples of Israel and Palestine two autonomous, sovereign States, as stipulated in all those UN resolutions which Israel has been violating for years.
The internal security of the Union must be reinforced - and I agree with much of what Mr Watson said - but always and only in respect for fundamental rights and the constraints of the rule of law.
Therefore, any extension of the competences or spheres of operation of bodies such as Europol or Eurojust must go hand in hand with the creation of a system of judicial and, most importantly, democratic controls, with Parliament playing an active role.
Any attempt to use the danger represented by terrorism to restrict or eliminate, by any means including Union or national legislative instruments, the huge democratic waves of dissent and opposition to the dominant social and economic system which are now sweeping through Europe and the world, must therefore be rejected, just as those legislative practices also referred to by Mr Barón Crespo such as the Italian laws on international letters rogatory, which are of practical assistance to terrorist and organised crime groups, must be condemned.
We hope that the fight against terrorism, which is a crime against humanity, will increasingly be seen as the responsibility of the entire international community, that is of the UN, rather than the responsibility of a small number of wealthy, powerful nations who often use their wealth and power not to combat terrorism and its causes but to consolidate their economic and political power.
The fact that the majority of the people in the world live in a state of despair, poverty and underdevelopment can never justify terrorism - never. This situation must be fought and eradicated by action, not just formal declarations, if we want our world to be at peace.
This is another area in which we must take action if we genuinely want to eliminate terrorism.
Mr President, EU leaders met in Ghent on 21 September to evaluate how the Union should react to the horrific terrorist attacks in America.
I welcome the solidarity which all EU leaders showed with the American government and the American people in their time of mourning and grief.
I also very much welcome the concrete plan of action that EU leaders are now going to implement in an effort to tackle international terrorism head-on.
But let me be clear about one point.
As a result of the terrorist attacks on 11 September it is now clear to us all that people are willing to engage in well-organised suicide missions to further their own political goals.
That means, in the simplest terms, that we are going to have to implement wide-ranging measures if we are going to be in a position to defeat the scourge of international terrorism.
In line with the conclusions of the Tampere Summit, EU leaders are committed to introducing a European arrest warrant, designed to supplant the current system of extradition in Europe.
Easing extradition, while protecting civil rights, is an important weapon in the fight against terrorism, and in particular within the Union, where free movement of persons exists.
The United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism is also going to be ratified in all Member States of the European Union.
Our finance ministers are going to bring forward proposals outlining a timetable for the implementation of the draft directive on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering.
The financial task force run by the OECD will be broadened to cover the issue of combating money laundering.
There is agreement to implement the framework directive permitting the freezing of criminal assets within the Union.
There has also been agreement on paying closer attention to the draft directive on insider dealing so as to guarantee that all activities linked to terrorism come under the auspices of the directive.
Intelligence agencies within the Member States of the Union, together with Europol, must work together more closely in terms of exchanging intelligence information if the terror networks operating in Europe are to be broken.
Finally, fanatical terrorism is difficult to defeat, but we must be prepared to be determined and vigorous in the counter-terrorism measures that we introduce.
We must all work together.
A united front, spearheaded by the Union and the United States, will be the only means of enabling us to defeat these cold-blooded and ruthless murderers.
Mr President, the summit is now to discuss the composition of the Convention that is to draft the EU' s constitution.
A majority of MEPs want to see the European Parliament' s representation doubled from 16 to 30.
The argument is made in terms of equality with the national parliaments which each had two Members in the Charter Convention, making a total of 30.
The name of my political group refers to a 'Europe of Democracies' in order to emphasise that we want democracy in the individual countries and democratic control of the EU.
Democracies can govern the EU jointly, but there is no European people, as such, to have given the European Parliament a mandate to negotiate a new constitution for the EU.
My group and the intergroup SOS Democracy instead proposes that we let each individual national parliament present proposals for the next treaty and then let representatives of the national parliaments prepare the draft treaty that is to replace the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The Commission, Parliament and the governments could be observers in such an assembly.
We would, at the same time, call upon the prime ministers to pledge that the next treaty will be subject to referendums in all the Member States.
A treaty adopted in a referendum could bear the insignia 'more democracy' rather than 'more Union' .
We should like to create a slimmer EU with greater freedom for the Member States: an open and democratic EU that is close to the people and is governed by electorates and elected representatives in the Member States; a more flexible Europe, open to the candidate countries and to all other European nations.
'A democratic EU' sounds all well and good, but it can only come about when there is a European public.
A living democracy requires a common language, culture, media, treasury of songs and sense of internal interdependence: in short, a European people.
A 'Europe of democracies' is the art of the possible.
The EU should be put on a slimming course and the focus shifted to cross-border matters which we cannot control as individual nations.
In that way, there would be no loss of democracy but a benefit in terms of shared influence, and the people of Europe would vote in favour of the next treaty.
Would they do so today, Mr President-in-Office of the Council?
Dare you allow the Belgians to vote on the Treaty of Nice?
Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, first a word on the defence aspect.
Much has been said about air safety and security, many measures have been taken at European level.
Curiously, though, there is not a word about our secret services; in fact, if there are a number of organisations that did not work, at any rate in the 15 Member States, they certainly include our secret services.
Today we see them digging away and finding out all sorts of things.
Perhaps it would have been better if they had discovered some of them beforehand.
They cost us dear. Nobody is quite sure what they do; sometimes we wonder whether they do anything.
No doubt that too could be a subject worth considering at European level and subjecting to parliamentary control, for they can present a risk: so long as we leave them total freedom of action, they will sometimes take inappropriate action.
Turning to the offensive aspect, yesterday the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Michel, provided the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy with a great deal of information.
He strongly emphasised the value of dialogue.
However, I think that unless this dialogue is accompanied by a political project, it may risk merely reinforcing certain positions.
We are currently endeavouring to forge an anti-terrorist coalition.
There are, in my view, two main risks.
Mr Poettering highlighted one of them: the measures to combat terrorism risk - and it is more than a risk, since they have already produced some very adverse results - provoking and encouraging state terrorism.
Mr Poettering specifically stated - and I thank him because authorised voices in his country, like that of Mr Schröder, seemed to agree with Mr Putin, who has still not provided us with a shred of evidence that the Chechens were responsible for the Moscow attacks, a point Mr Lannoye also emphasised - that it can be tempting to use this great anti-terrorist battle to settle a few scores at home, in Tibet for the Chinese, in Chechnya for the Russians, etc.
That is an aspect we must bear in mind.
The other issue is the Arab world.
There has been much criticism of certain statements that were made.
I believe we all agree that this is not a clash of civilisation between Islam and Christianity but, obviously, a clash of civilisation between democracy and non-democracy and that we have to take the offensive in that conflict.
We must help all those people in the Arab countries, in the Muslim countries, who are fighting, often at the price of their freedom, at the price of torture, and often at the price of death; and this Parliament, our European Union, is certainly not doing enough in that respect.
Examples such as Morocco and Jordan show that the Arab countries can move towards democracy.
Other countries that might have gone the same way have in fact done the opposite, such as Tunisia: in fact, it would not take much to change the course in that country, which has a ruling class, a cultured class, an education system, and which recognises the rights of women, the equal rights of men and women.
In that respect our policy is aiding and abetting Mr Ben Ali in consolidating a regime that is moving further away from the rule of law every day and is becoming enclosed in a vicious circle of state gangsterism.
An offensive policy means supporting the people of Tunisia who are working for the rule of law, for freedom.
Mr President, the MPF delegation members approve both the 'solidarity and cooperation with the United States' and the 'European policy' headings of the action plan against terrorism adopted by the extraordinary European Council of 21 September.
However, we feel the practical value of introducing a European arrest warrant and a common definition of terrorism have been rather overestimated.
Similarly, it may seem a good idea in theory to give Europol new powers, but this organisation is not doing very well as it is and first we would have to call for an independent and objective audit of the way it operates.
But these are all secondary issues.
Overall, we approve the Council's conclusions.
In particular, we welcome the establishment of Eurojust, which is to develop forms of judicial and police cooperation and create synergy between the existing systems instead of trying to demolish them.
Like the Council, we also call for the speedy ratification of all existing international conventions, like the convention on the financing of terrorism, whose implementation has been seriously delayed.
However, in spite of all that, Mr President, we are still not happy.
That brings me to my main point.
Although the Council adopted long lists of actions to be undertaken, they remain one-off measures and the European Union is still not really prepared to examine its own conscience.
It would be difficult to deny that the inquiry into the 11 September attacks is currently concentrating on Europe and that it shows that, for years now, the terrorists have been centring their preparations in Europe, which they have used as their base.
All this is not pure chance.
The day after the attacks, a French newspaper interviewed the current president of Eurojust, Mrs Coninsx, asking her the following question, and I quote from the article: 'is the loose Islamist conglomeration strongly established in Europe?'
Mrs Coninsx, head of Eurojust, replied: 'Europe may act as a logistical fallback for these terrorists. It is, indeed, fairly easy to cross frontiers because of the Schengen area' .
Everyone knows that.
It is true for the terrorists, but it is also true for fissile materials, it is true for stolen works of art, it is true for illegal immigrants, etc. In fact it was only yesterday and in this very place that I accused the Commission of all too often concealing the problems of illegal immigration.
Europol informs us that 500 000 illegal immigrants enter EU territory every year, a figure that I actually think is an underestimate.
At any rate, it means that millions of foreigners live on our soil permanently and illegally.
So let me ask you: if countries let in millions of foreigners without discovering them and allow them to live there illegally, can they be regarded as in control of their territory?
Obviously you will all say 'no' .
It is now up to the Council, and the Council alone, to issue strong instructions in order to restore some balance.
The President of the Council has rightly said that the fight against terrorism will be global and sustained.
We have to draw all the necessary conclusions from that, discard outdated points of view, give priority to security, review all the old strategies that are no longer appropriate and begin by admitting that controls do not prejudice freedom of movement; while they harm criminals they protect citizens' freedoms.
The Council must, therefore, call immediately for a list of all the documents that need reviewing from a security point of view and, in particular, that disastrous Article 62(1) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which promises a total absence of any kind of control of individuals at the internal frontiers five years after its entry into force.
We need a general review plan, of which the Council must be directly in charge.
That means we need to review Article 67 of the Treaty of Amsterdam...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Since the attacks of 11 September, the world has been on tenterhooks.
People are shocked.
They feel for the victims and those left behind, and their own sense of security has reached an all-time low.
People expect their governments to guarantee their safety.
They realise that this is not wholly possible but they are asking for efficient and conclusive action, and rightly so.
Anyone who is responsible for security these days has a complex task to fulfil.
The need for true, European integration and international coordination has been brought into focus more than ever, both in words and deeds.
Mr President, I very much hope that you will be able to carry out your action plan of 21 September effectively, and that the Belgian Presidency will be able to take specific decisions in this connection.
We have all asserted that the attacks were not so much directed at innocent victims as at the symbols of freedom, democracy and human rights, including the right to life.
Nobody will deny that the European Parliament too is a symbol of these values.
Of course, we do not want to proclaim ourselves as targets, nor do we want to spread panic, but many MEPs are worried, as already stated by group chairman, Mr Poettering.
In Strasbourg, the entrances and the immediate surroundings of this building are under police surveillance.
In Brussels, however, we are even denied the illusion of security.
If, moreover, we infer from the words of the Belgian Minister for the Interior here that he sees no indication of a need for tighter security, then we have a real reason to worry.
For terrorists do not give warnings, something which a Minister for the Interior should realise.
That is why, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs, I would like to ask you to persuade your Minister for the Interior and the police in Belgium to think again. Not only in the interests of the safety of the MEPs of the 15 Member States, but also in the interests of their colleagues, their visitors, the safety of the city, which is the capital of Europe, and in the interest of the values for which we all stand.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what are Europe's tasks in these times?
First, Europe must support the victim against the aggressor.
We hold to our treaty commitments.
We salute the firm and considered attitude of the United States government.
We also welcome the European Council's expression of solidarity with the USA.
All of you must make it your concern that Europe is not divided into doves and hawks!
Secondly, the European Union must play its part in forging a worldwide political alliance against terrorism.
We appreciate what you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, with Mr Solana and Mr Patten, have undertaken not only in the Arab countries but also in Russia.
We ask that you continue your efforts as intermediaries in the Middle East, above all between Israel and the Palestinians.
They are in the best interests of us all.
Thirdly, we must, join together in reinforcing our internal security.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is regrettable that the European Council, and the Council of Interior and Justice Ministers as well, have only now got around to partially implementing plans that already existed and had been thoroughly worked out.
We expect action against terrorism, not reactions to terrorist attacks.
In doing this, Europe must continue to be an example of how to maintain the balance between the right to individual liberty and the security of all.
Fourthly, we want Europeans not to be distracted from their common commitment to a more just world order, in which law for all replaces force exerted by the few.
We are not making this effort for a more just world order solely out of a belief that we will thereby be depriving terrorism of its breeding ground.
On the contrary, we seek a more just world order because that reflects our values and our dignity as Europeans - a dignity we share with all the peoples of the earth!
Fifthly, if it is true to say that the world is no longer what it was before 11 September, then the European Union cannot stay as it is.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we welcome your intentions for Ghent and Laeken.
We hope they do not remain only as intentions but that what you have put before us will indeed become the opinion of the Fifteen and a basis for our further work.
Europe could be broken by the crisis now facing the world.
It could, though, equally, emerge stronger from it.
It is at this crossroads that you and all of us will be standing in Ghent and Laeken.
In this crisis, Europe can - and I would add - must show its citizens what the European Union is really worth.
By this yardstick you and all of us will be judged.
Mr President, 11 September will go down in history.
It will create a new framework for our daily lives and our political work.
The subtitles on CNN have read 'America at war' for a long time now.
Europe has been there. Europe has been at war.
Europe has experience of being a theatre of war.
The United States has helped us in the past, and we in turn must therefore, of course, help the United States now.
However, Europe also knows that wars are not won with weapons alone.
Conflicts cannot be prevented with weapons.
Wars cannot be won with weapons alone and, above all, peace cannot be built with the aid of weapons alone.
It may be the case that weapons are necessary, but we must be clear that other things are also required.
I should like to highlight two things that are necessary to the European agenda.
The first is the urgent proposal we are debating at present.
It is regrettable that it is only now that we are debating such a proposal.
I wish to endorse what other speakers have said. I should like to emphasise that there is, of course, a reason why we are only discussing the proposal now.
Far too many people have too many financial interests in this matter. There are too many people who do not wish to reveal what is in their hidden accounts.
That is why it has been impossible for Europe to do anything before now, and it may well also prove quite difficult now.
The second thing I want to say is that, if we do not gather grassroots support for further European cooperation, we shall lack the communal spirit needed to stand firm against terrorists.
Mr President, yesterday, Mr Nielson stood here and reported on the situation in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan was on the list of forgotten countries before 11 September.
Now, however, the situation has become all but catastrophic.
The World Bank has produced a report showing that between 20000 and 40 000 children per day will die of hunger because of the economic recession caused by the events of 11 September.
In the EU' s Member States, we have received a report to the effect that foreigners and refugees are being persecuted.
This is shown by the Monitoring Centre on Racism in its report.
We are, of course, all appalled at what happened on 11 September, but what these events showed us first and foremost was, of course, that the world has shrunk and that no one is safe.
The American missile shield would not have helped in this situation. Nor did all the American military hardware help, either.
Now, we are moving on to talk about the need to strengthen democracy and dialogue.
However, the anti-terrorism package we have debated - not the one concerning the economy, but the other - reeks of distrust.
The ambition to strengthen the police and intelligence services completely overshadows the fight to strengthen human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
We will not accept increased powers, either for Europol or the intelligence services, until we have got them under democratic control.
Combating terrorism must not overshadow freedoms of expression and assembly.
I should like to ask whether there is anyone who believes that our world will become safer when we prohibit certain organisations.
Terrorism, killing, robbery and the destruction of property are to be forbidden, Well, they are already forbidden.
Those responsible must be caught, and they must be punished.
I do not wish to defend anti-democratic organisations, but the question is whether our world will become safer if these organisations go underground and are made illegal.
There are limits to the number of problems that can be solved by legislation alone, and I think that the first package is evidence of more haste, less speed.
Our task must be to remove the basis for terrorism.
I therefore think that the Troika initiative was a step in the right direction and one that favoured dialogue and the creation of a broad alliance to combat terrorism.
However, there are problems in the alliance.
When China demands, as a condition of its being a part of the alliance, that we close our eyes to what is happening in Tibet; when Russia demands that we close our eyes to events in Chechnya; when Turkey demands that we close our eyes to the fate of the Kurds; and when Israel demands that we close our eyes to the situation of the Palestinians, then we do not have a safe world.
There must be security for all, including oppressed people and also the 20 000 to 40 000 children who will die of hunger next year.
Mr President, the writing on Commander Massoud' s tombstone reads: "Here lies a man who was like an angel: let him guide you.
His name is Massoud" .
We must follow him and defend those who are fighting terrorism, trying to restore their people' s freedom, democracy and human rights.
Yet we did not help Commander Massoud when he came to Strasbourg in April to condemn the crimes of the Taliban. Let us at least help the Afghan people and the civilised world to overcome terrorists and fundamentalists.
However, our statements of condemnation must be followed by practical action: words alone are not enough.
Therefore, we wonder why it is that the terrorists' bank accounts are only being frozen now, if the governments and intelligence were already aware of these accounts before.
Why have the Internet sites which continue to promote terrorist initiatives and maintain links with subversive cells throughout the world, recruiting new terrorists all the while, not yet been condemned and closed?
We call for the Community funding and financing programmes aiding those governments which are not joining the alliance to combat terrorism and, in any case, continue to harbour terrorists on their territory, to be frozen immediately.
Mr President, the possible establishment of a Convention is taking up most of the attention in the debate on the future of the European Union.
This morning, I would like to draw your attention to another point, namely the timeframe for the preparation of the next IGC.
It is understandable that this Parliament does not want an IGC in 2004, for that is the year when elections will be held and the Commission steps down.
However, would 2003, as Parliament suggested, be a good alternative?
In the Netherlands, we have a saying 'haastige spoed is zelden goed' (more haste, less speed).
When one considers the weighty subjects on the agenda, it very much confirms that more time should be taken to reflect.
Moreover, the topics of the IGC are sufficiently interesting to be the subject of the election battle.
In addition, it is also necessary to give the applicant states a vote in this important debate.
In short, 2003 is far too early and 2004 is far too hectic.
Could the Council not decide to hold the IGC in 2005?
Mr President, the attacks in New York and in Washington also claimed many of our own citizens.
That means, therefore, that there is more than simply a display of solidarity on our part. We are united in our fate.
It is therefore logical that Article 5 of the NATO Treaty has been invoked, which means that we are involved in NATO responses every step of the way.
We carry full responsibility, and we must therefore be aware of the reactions that are heading our way.
All the terrorists wanted to attain was chaos and unreasoning revenge.
The response to that must be measured and specifically targeted at the people and organisations responsible.
The security instruments must be comprehensively reinforced.
That is why I agree that Europol and Eurojust should clearly be given more scope and be integrated into a constitutional state structure.
The European arrest warrant, the common definition of terrorism and organised crime, more flexible extradition: these are all vital instruments.
Member State Ministers who tire themselves out producing objections will undoubtedly be considered 'useful idiots' - to use a term from the cold war era.
What more is needed to enable us to safeguard our common internal security, whereby the sovereignty of Member States is used to benefit the citizens in a way that does not conflict with their interests?
Every Member State should realise that if they offer sanctuary to criminals who seek the necessary peace and quiet to plan their crimes, they themselves can become targets.
The improvement of international relations also strengthens international security.
That is why we need to make good use of the structures in place, such as the Mediterranean dialogue and the United Nations.
Contact with certain sections of the Afghan population is necessary, particularly in the interests of providing relief to those in need.
The resolution which came about under the competent guidance of Mr Collins receives our full support.
We would only like to adopt one single amendment from the old, socialist resolution, and replace Article 26 on Gibraltar with our own wording.
Apart from that, we give our wholehearted approval to the joint outcome.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will reply quickly to some of the questions; unfortunately I have to be fairly brief because I cannot stay till the end of the sitting.
Let me begin with some further information about the convention.
Several Members raised this matter.
I think it is important to say, since the question was asked, that the principle of holding a convention to prepare for the IGC has, I believe, been accepted.
It has also, of course, been agreed that representatives of the governments, the Commission, the national parliaments and the European Parliament, that is, a quadripartite group, will take part.
This participation could take the following form: government representatives - possibly numbering 15 - 16 MEPs, 30 members of national parliaments and one Commission representative.
However, I am not going to start a debate about numbers at this point.
What is important to remember is that the number of participants in this convention must be reduced somewhat.
It must not be exponential.
Of course, we could try to please everyone, but then we would end up with a convention that was not viable.
I believe we have to remember that.
The Laeken European Council will, no doubt, or, at least, that seems the most likely road, appoint a president, assisted by a bureau made up of at least one member of each component of the convention and assisted by a secretariat.
The convention's brief would not be to adopt a final text but, at this stage - I think that answers Mr Barón Crespo's question as to whether these are proposals or whether these are options - simply to decide whether we are in favour of options rather than proposals, leaving it, of course, to the bodies concerned to choose from among these options, since options are never more than variations on proposals.
I am not embracing any one point of view: I am simply describing things as they are.
If it was just up to me, believe me we would go much further than proposals. We would be more radical.
However, I simply have to adjust to toeing the presidency's line...
So I am telling you what I believe I have to tell you for the sake of transparency.
I can do no more.
The convention should become operational as soon as possible, during the Spanish Presidency, that is, during the first half of 2002.
Let me also touch on two questions relating to this convention: it is important that you remember them but also that you can discuss them and make your views on the subject known.
First of all, it is important to gain the support of the candidate countries.
We saw a fairly strong convergence of views in Genval on the need to involve the candidate countries in the convention.
Although, in effect, we are moving towards giving them a status and right of say there, obviously we still have to define the precise procedures for their representation.
Here, the presidency is putting forward three possible formulas: representation modelled from the outset on that of the Member States, namely one representative of each government and two members of each national parliament - that is conceivable; or one representative per country for the duration of the convention's activities; or, the third formula, progressive representation, consisting of a single representative until the accession treaty has been signed, then representation in line with that of the Member States after the signature.
Representatives of the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions could also be invited as observers.
Those are the ideas now on the table.
The next question is how to involve civil society.
On the whole, the idea of a civil forum was well received by the delegations.
Nevertheless, some questions came up about the composition of this forum, that is, the selection of representatives of civil society - its organisational procedures and the nature of its links with the convention, which could, for example, take the form of hearings or a variety of other formulas.
In the presidency's view, this forum could take either of two forms.
Either it could be like an enlarged assembly, in which case one would need to define its exact composition, role and modus operandi; or it could be a structured network, made up of organisations representing civil society, established at European level.
The organisations making up that network would be kept officially informed of the activities of the convention and their written contributions would form part of the official documentation forwarded to members of the convention. They would be heard by the convention, in accordance with procedures to be defined, and, where appropriate, they could also be consulted by the convention on specific issues.
If that option were adopted, it would probably be advisable to appoint a coordinator at political level, who could be chosen either by the Laeken European Council or by the convention itself.
That is the additional information I wanted to give you on the convention and you are, of course, welcome to come back to us with any ideas this might suggest to you or inspire in you, since that is the purpose of this kind of exchange of views.
I am entirely open to any comments, ideas or suggestions on the subject.
Several Members raised the issue of security in Brussels, so I will address their concern.
I do not think there are any difficulties in principle, except for one aspect where we do come up against certain problems - I will endeavour to analyse this matter and take a closer look - namely the question of unconditional access to Belgian territory.
I do believe this could pose a number of problems.
That aside, it looks as though we can certainly reach an agreement fairly soon.
I promise I will discuss it with the Home Affairs and Justice Ministers immediately after my return so that I can give you practical answers to your questions as quickly as possible.
Let me highlight something that has emerged from our debates and to which I too am paying close attention.
If we take a whole range of measures to combat terrorism effectively, they will necessarily - and we must not pretend otherwise - involve the risk of taking measures that curtail freedoms.
Mr Barón Crespo said so and Mr Lannoye also drew our attention to it.
I have heard statements in this Chamber that show that some people have not entirely understood this: for instance, if I had to translate Mr Berthu's programme into action, it is clear that this would lead straight to a society which restricts freedoms, which would have nothing to do, let me say, with the quality of life, with the democratic quality of our societies.
That is the way it is, that is my opinion and I am sharing it with you.
I think we must be very watchful here, for this really is an important issue.
We cannot bring back the olden days on the pretext of fighting terrorism.
I think that would be very dangerous, so I am not in favour of it.
I believe the difficulty we will keep encountering will be, precisely, how to evaluate our margin for manoeuvre constantly.
But let us please not give in to a security phobia, because sooner or later we would all end up as victims and that would be democracy's loss.
Mr Lannoye and several others made a most important point in relation to our foreign policy and I entirely agree with him here: the enemies of our enemies are not necessarily our friends.
Of course, I agree with him.
It is true that, under cover of this kind of consensual coalition, necessarily based on immediate needs and, admittedly, to some extent also on feelings that are justified, it might well be tempting to overlook, to look away from or to forget certain aspects.
I think it was yesterday, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy that I was asked whether I had put any questions to my interlocutors about State terrorism.
I think we must not, indeed, lose sight of that aspect in considering our approach, our European commitment and our values.
It is true that we will have to be very vigilant here too; in other words, sometimes we must not forget that countries, organisations and bodies that form part of the coalition should also, to some extent, render account for some of their own practices, forms of behaviour and policies.
I therefore agree that we must avoid any kind of naive optimism in this respect and not forget to continue to fight for and campaign for a democratic society wherever possible in the world.
I therefore agree that we must strengthen the role of the International Criminal Court.
As time goes by, we come to realise that it is absolutely crucial to have that vital tool at our disposal.
I was asked whether I am in favour of incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into a constitution.
You all know my views on this.
Unfortunately, I do not think everybody is quite ready for it yet.
Nevertheless, I believe that there are all sorts of arguments that can be put forward and that we must, therefore, pursue this debate.
We will get there in the end.
Another important aspect on which I was questioned was the danger of curtailing freedoms.
It is true that if we take a range of measures - Members have referred to the freezing of assets and various other measures - we must ensure that, however urgent, they are accompanied by a systematic evaluation process, preferably conducted soon after their adoption, whatever their nature.
I think that it will, of course, be necessary for urgent measures to be re-evaluated fairly early on and fairly regularly.
We must avoid a practice often seen in some countries - and I know this happens in Belgium - where temporary measures are still being applied 50 years later.
So I support those who call for guarantees.
In the event of urgent measures, we must indeed lay down a procedure of regular re-evaluation of those measures.
Apart from that, I basically agree with the ideas and concerns that have been expressed.
Mr Dupuis spoke of the effectiveness of the secret services.
I must admit that I know little about the secret services, since they are secret.
I suppose that, from that point of view, they certainly are effective.
I would simply appeal for more regular exchanges of information, deeper integration and closer coordination.
I think others will agree with me on this point.
I also replied to Mr Dupuis on the question of the risk of encouraging State terrorism or, at any rate, concealing certain facts about certain countries.
I also agree that we must not abandon our action; we must persevere and continue trying to persuade certain countries to move towards democracy.
We must not conceal that aspect or pretend the problem no longer exists in certain Arab countries.
We must nevertheless continue to bring it up.
I, personally, am convinced that we must strengthen political dialogue wherever we can, a political dialogue without taboos.
I think it is quite possible to impose that dialogue in our relations.
It is a minimum condition and, during my visit to Iran, for example, we agreed to set up a European Union-Iran group, which would have human rights questions as the only item on its agenda.
This was accepted.
We definitely need to take more initiatives of this kind.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I believe I have answered as fully as possible although I may well have omitted some aspects.
Let me say, however, that, in general, I broadly share the concerns you expressed.
I heard them clearly. In any case, I undertake to pass them on to the quarters concerned.
I will do my utmost to transmit faithfully the information, ideas, criticisms and suggestions Parliament has offered me today.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council of 21 September initiated the forthcoming review of our fundamental concepts.
Since 9 November 1989 Europe has known that the cold war is over; but since 11 September 2001 the world has known that this cold war is over and it is now time to form global alliances against terrorism.
Today the right to speak will go to those who can demonstrate their full solidarity with the United States and commit themselves unreservedly to this fight against terrorism.
But that also means forbidding any sideslipping within our own ranks, for neither obscurantism nor fanaticism are permissible weapons in the fight against terrorism.
We will also have to inquire into the root causes.
The European Union knows that not all acts of terrorism are the consequence of poverty, but frustration and humiliation do feed terrorism.
We must, therefore, review our development policy again.
We must cancel the developing countries' debt.
We must resume our work on light arms trafficking.
We must urge everybody to play their part in the multilateral structures.
Within our institutions, we must give ourselves the means to prevent all forms of conflict, for they are also a source of tension.
I do not believe this is the moment to drop one of Parliament's initiatives, namely the prevention centre, which we are now told may be under threat.
The European Council showed that it was able to draw the consequences of the fight that lies ahead.
To mention only a few issues, let us turn first to the question of the financing of terrorism.
Yes, the Union put itself in a position where it could fight the Talibans' money and freeze their assets, thanks to the regulation of 4 July 2001.
Some European countries, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom, have already frozen these assets.
Yesterday the Commission proposed a new initiative. Perhaps the Commissioner could tell us on what basis the Commission envisages the revision of that annex.
It is an important question because this is the first time Parliament has been consulted on measures of this kind.
Then there is the fight against money laundering, the fight against tax havens; we will have to give new impetus to all these tasks on which the European Union has embarked.
These upheavals have come at a moment when the European Union is entering the final stage of its transition to the euro, when it is engaged in vital projects: enlargement, but also the definition of a genuine common foreign and security policy, the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice.
These projects will be given a strong boost, circumstances will sweep away any hesitation, force us to be resolute.
But if we are to be able to seize this opportunity for Europe, Ghent will have to live up to our high expectations.
I can tell the Council representative that while we welcome the adoption of a convention, Parliament will not support a system of options.
On the other hand, Parliament will certainly support the Council when it comes to broadening the agenda of that convention, to asking useful questions, for instance whether we need to maintain the pillar structure. What kind of presidency will the Union have?
Mr President, it is only natural that the issue of the fight against terrorism should be given a certain amount of attention in Ghent.
The European Union has acted with impressive unity and decisiveness.
We can look forward to a long-term battle on several fronts, including the political and the legal fronts, with a sensitive balance regarding respect for legal rights.
In terms of the long view politically and economically, we may also be able to establish a better legal system with a stronger UN.
It is gratifying that the US has realised the importance of the UN and is paying its debts to that organisation.
Perhaps the EU can also get the US to ratify the protocol on the International Criminal Court.
Of course, we must also work in the long term to achieve peace and democracy throughout the Middle East.
In Ghent, enlargement will also be discussed.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party believes it is vital that each country be assessed on its own merits and that the principle of differentiation be genuinely upheld.
That is a message I should like to send to the presidency.
Finally, when it comes to the Convention, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the concrete explanations.
However, there is still a certain amount of concern in this area.
The Convention is not a debating club for talking in rather general terms about various alternatives regarding the future of Europe.
The Convention is not an alibi for the Council, but a serious and democratic partner in this discussion.
Regardless of its composition - I hope that the candidate countries will be given a strong role to play in this context - the Convention will contain a large number of hard-working parliamentarians who need to know that the work that is put in is taken very seriously.
Mr President, war is not the answer.
Our message of suffering for the victims should not turn into a war cry.
These were the main signals sent out by the thousands of American demonstrators who took to the streets of Washington last Saturday.
On our side of the Atlantic, tens of thousands of demonstrators in Athens, Rome, Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam, Prague, Barcelona, Stockholm, Istanbul and elsewhere raised their voices in protest against the warmongering plans of the American and European imperialists.
What has happened is that those who systematically engage in state terrorism, those who made the Bin Ladens and the KLA what they are, those who turned whole nations into terrorists have found a golden opportunity, following the hideous terrorist attack in the USA, to settle their accounts with anyone and everyone who opposes their world dominion.
At the same time, in the countries of the European Union and the United States, suppressive policing measures have been stepped up in order to gag anyone who stands up against or questions their anti-grass roots policy.
The President of the United States said that the war against 'terrorism' will last a long time.
The resistance of peace-loving grass-roots forces will be equally long-lasting.
We are certain that the justice of peace will prevail against the barbarism of imperialist war.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although I fully support the conclusions of the extraordinary European Summit in Brussels, I can only condemn the amount of time it is taking Europe to make a practical response to terrorism top priority.
It took thousands of deaths for us to be able to come to an agreement on establishing the European search and arrest warrant; it took thousands of innocent victims for us to be able to agree on defining a common strategy to combat terrorism.
Only now is the Union being called upon to participate more actively in the prevention and stabilisation of regional conflicts.
Where was Europe - we wonder - when the Mediterranean sea was seen as the border between two opposing worlds, between Islamic fundamentalism and religious tolerance?
Will the Union please realise, at last, that we can only define a European security and defence policy if we take the Mediterranean as our starting point.
I live on the farthest edge of European territory in the Mediterranean, just a few metres away from the most advanced NATO base - the Sigonella base - and a few minutes away from the Middle East by 'plane.
I know how willing the moderate Arab and Muslim world is to cooperate; I met the mayor of Jerusalem and the mayor of Gaza last year.
Well then, I am convinced that it is now up to Europe genuinely to start to turn what have hitherto just been good intentions into practical action.
There are quite a few worrying messages from the Brussels Summit.
First of all, it is glaringly obvious that the summit reflects a shockingly small degree of self-knowledge, which also characterises the United States' s government.
There is no understanding of the fact that there is a political background to the horrific massacres on 11 September.
In keeping with this small degree of self-knowledge, at odds with the insights of international conflict researchers, alliances for combating terrorism are being entered into with the world' s most effective State-authorised terrorists.
Russian genocide in Chechnya is being legitimised, and alliances entered into with oligarchies in Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Chechnya, not to mention Saudi Arabia.
Any intervention is legitimised in this way and, at the same time, attempts at international conflict resolution under the UN system, including the international administration of justice, are being set aside.
Moreover, the adoption of new police measures is tailored to the same pattern and based on the same low level of self-knowledge.
It is the end that justifies the means.
In this case, the means will deprive us of the very democracies we are supposed to be defending.
I believe it will subsequently be possible to say, 'The operation was a success, but the patient died.'
Mr President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, I hope that the terrorist atrocity on 11 September had the same effect on the Council, that is to say the Interior and Justice Ministers, as it did on the Heads of State and Government, namely that of shaking them awake and bringing it home to them that national resentments and animosities have no place in the fight against terrorism.
I see these resolutions overall in a positive light.
We must, though, be able to expect a rapid start to be made on putting them into effect.
I also expect the Union at last to embrace the possibilities already open to it; that the Member States will at last comply with their obligations and supply the necessary information to Europol in The Hague; and that the counter-terrorist Conventions will at last be brought into force.
I also look forward to Europol being supplied with the personnel and technology it needs to its at last being put in a position to carry out an investigation into the state of terrorist networks in Europe and to a joint investigation team soon being set up.
What I look for from the Summit is that new projects will be called into being, such as intensive cooperation between Europol and the United States security services and the networking of police databases, ranging from Europol to Schengen via Olaf, so that these might be used against terrorism; that Eurojust should become the reality to which Mr Poettering has just referred, working closely with Europol; and that Europol should be developed in the direction of the first pillar, with authority to conduct investigations; and that the intergovernmental level should be abandoned in favour of the European in closely circumscribed areas of organised crime.
In other words, to take this cooperation in security policy as an example, Europe has a great opportunity to bring the added value of the European Union home to its citizens.
Let us make use of this opportunity without delay!
Mr President, the tragic events of 11 September have shown, once again, how wide the gap is between the Europe that is and the Europe that ought to be.
The shock we felt at the inconceivable level of violence reached by terrorism must now give way to a practical endeavour to provide Europe with the political and institutional tools it needs to play a role combating terrorism and working towards peace and justice in the world.
We therefore welcome the decisions of the extraordinary European Council of 21 September in the field of judicial cooperation and home affairs and on combating money laundering.
Against this tragic backdrop, the decision of the Italian government and the majority supporting it to make changes to the judicial cooperation treaty with Switzerland appears even more serious and irresponsible, changes to its own code of criminal procedure which are in direct conflict with the commitments made at the extraordinary Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council.
This law would mean that evidence gathered abroad could not be used in court proceedings and that, since this measure applies retrospectively, it would jeopardise hundreds of trials which are currently in progress, nullifying evidence already established.
It is this kind of decision which made the Public Prosecutor of Geneva say that this law is a disaster for international justice and that, in twelve years of judicial cooperation with countries throughout the world, he has never, ever seen rules like this adopted.
Since I feel that this is not the right place to express an opinion, I call upon the Commission, the Council and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to ascertain whether this measure is in line with the decisions of the extraordinary Summit.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, stated before the United Nations General Assembly, the terrorist attack of 11 September was an attack on the very ideal of free, inclusive, civilised society and on its practice of openness and tolerance.
The attack will be unsuccessful only if we are able to enhance these characteristics rather than weaken them.
Our initial response, our initial reaction must be to switch off the psychological 'emergency' mode and get a grip on our agenda.
Therefore, I welcome the commitment to be made at Ghent to proceed with the debates on the euro, enlargement and the political integration of Europe at Laeken and through the Convention.
It is in this sense that the fight against terrorism must be seen as part of a series of structural operations.
In the area of air safety, for example, we must proceed on two levels: on the one hand, there is an urgent need for a revision of the Regulation establishing the European Air Safety Authority, extending its responsibilities to include accident prevention and - if we can call it that - terrorism prevention; on the other, we need incisive action from the International Civil Aviation Organisation to ensure that the rules we are seeking to adopt for Europe become rules which are binding upon the whole world.
Europe must be capable of taking the initiative in this and many other minor areas to express all that potential for peace and democracy which is its strength and must become the strength of the whole world.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we Europeans should be clear in our own minds that we are going to be weighed in the balance in the times that lie ahead.
The United States of America and world public opinion will be looking to see whether we demonstrate our solidarity and our capacity to act in the face of the new challenges of international terrorism which have just become visible.
European effectiveness has hitherto often fallen at the hurdle of national sovereignty.
Effective joint action has often been blocked by invoking national sovereignty.
Now, national sovereignty is not an objective in itself, and certainly not if it tends to hinder rather than promote the defence of national independence against terrorists and the effective protection of citizens against terrorist attacks.
It is for that reason that the future will see us having to develop effective Community instruments and examining whether national sovereignty helps or hinders us in doing so.
Solidarity with the United States is a principle invoked on every side, and this is right and proper, as this attack has been not only on the United States but also on our fundamental values, as was intended.
That is why it is so perilous for a member of the Commission, namely Mr Nielson, to abandon Europeans' solidarity as a community.
His remarks are dangerous because they blur responsibility for the terrorist action, transfer the guilt for it onto the victims, and pour scorn on the solidarity we affirm in the resolution on which we are voting.
These remarks, then, must be withdrawn.
We can expect Mr Nielson to apologise for them.
Mr President, it was as if Europe was drowsing.
Its one dream seemed to be comfort and peace.
Suddenly the shock of the brutal terrorist attacks in New York profoundly shook its confidence and its hedonism.
Europe suddenly felt vulnerable and unprepared.
After all, its hard-won fundamental freedoms were being threatened by mysterious terrorist networks, which nonetheless appeared to be dominated by Islamist religious proselytism.
This violent and anti-modernist proselytism is anti-Western by definition.
However, this does not authorise cultural cretinism and historic ignorance leading to an abusive fusion between Islam and the aberrant, irrational and sectarian assertions of the perpetrators of the attacks.
It was not only the United States, the target of these sinister attacks, which was put to the test.
Europe was also put to the test and the European Union has to do some deep soul-searching.
In the immediate aftermath, still in shock, the European Union proved equal to the occasion at the Brussels Summit.
It was fast, clear and precise in its emergency responses.
But, now what?
Europe cannot in future act in such a spontaneous, opportunistic and superficial way.
Europe cannot be a plaything of destiny, a destiny plotted by others.
What has been established in Ghent and Laeken is that Europe should completely rethink its project and its role in light of the new world order and adopt a clear guideline for the troubled times ahead.
Without becoming unduly pessimistic about the human condition, Europe must be less ingenuous in the face of the dangers that will arise in the future.
Europe must unite more strongly on the economic level, the political level, the military level and in its internal security.
That is obvious.
But how is it to do so?
What are its priorities beyond fighting relentlessly against terrorism?
What are the new aims of the European project?
Will enlargement continue to take place on the same terms?
Will it not be necessary, from now on, to speed up the accession of, for example, Turkey to the European Union?
Will it not be the most elementary common sense to give absolute priority to the strategy for the Mediterranean and provide new impetus to partnerships with the Muslim countries?
Mr President, the attacks on New York and Washington were a new form of terrorism on a new scale, amounting to an act of war.
The intention of the coalition, led by the United States, to eradicate terrorism deserves the support of the European democracies in particular.
We welcome the measures taken by the European Council since the attacks and we are playing our part in putting them swiftly into effect.
However, let us also be vigilant in ensuring that the European Union does not, in its haste, take steps which exceed the current needs.
In some cases, these measures should be renewable and temporary.
Last week in Rome I and my colleagues had a series of meetings in connection with the reaction to terrorism.
We met the exiled Afghan King, Mohammed Zahir Shah, who ruled for 40 years until 1973 and who in 1964 introduced free elections and a free media and brought women into politics.
We affirm our support for the central role he is willing to play in the return to democracy of his country.
We urge the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to take up immediate contacts with the king.
We also had meetings with Italian ministers and were able to express our thanks for the additional deployment of troops in the Balkans, allowing British special forces to be deployed in another theatre.
We also discussed at the Vatican the values shared by all faiths, including Islam, concerning the integrity of human beings, their rights and the universal belief in the peaceful resolution of disputes, whether in the context of democracy or other systems.
We held meetings with the World Food Programme and were told that the international community should start to plan now for a reconstruction agency similar to the one the European Union set up for Kosovo.
Even before the current crisis, drought, a failing economy and war had turned Afghanistan into one of the most difficult places to live on earth, with as many as 22% of children in some districts dead before they had reached five years of age and an average life expectancy of 40.
The actions about to begin are designed not simply to eradicate terrorism, but also to eradicate an evil regime.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that we support the anti-terrorist measures announced by the presidency, both these measures and any others needed, goes without saying.
We stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States in the global coalition against terrorism, although we have little advice to offer about the technical, policing or military measures which will need to be applied.
What we can do, however, is to speak with perhaps greater authority about the political preconditions to success.
No campaign of this sort and no war, at least no war in which democracies have taken part, has ever been able to create the necessary alliance of nations - because that is the alliance which counts, not the alliance of governments - without offering a vision of a better world at the end of the campaign.
Politically, we need to point out yet again that we support all the democratic regimes and, more to the point, that we reject any tyrannical regimes which may promise to help fight specific terrorist organisations but which, in the long term, work with secret services which collaborate with them like terrorist recruiting offices.
Socially, we need to recognise that environmental catastrophes, epidemics, poverty and misery threaten the security of the world and need to be dealt with as threats which are every bit as serious as terrorism.
We need to state that, in a globalised society, our wealth and our military power do not offer the man in the street any security.
The only realistic solution is to find ways of taking the tension out of social and ethnic fights, of reconciling all men of good faith, irrespective of nationality, religion, social position or ideology, in fact everyone who is determined to put an end to the scourges which inflict mankind and which, even if they do not result in terrorism, prepare the ground for terrorism and we need to remove this ground if we are to guarantee the security of our citizens.
Mr President, a great Italian writer, Oriana Fallaci, breaking years of voluntary silence, has written a major article seeking to stir the consciences of many Europeans involved in the fight against terrorism and to promote the values of freedom, democracy and tolerance throughout the world.
At a time when fresh threats are being made to American targets in Italy, it is the European Union' s duty to take the lead in defending these values, which apply to all citizens.
That is why, while I support the decisions taken by the Council at Brussels, I feel that it is vital that, as we implement the inevitable specific military initiatives, we must step up political and economic initiatives as well.
In any case, I cannot remain silent regarding a controversial point raised in this Chamber: Mrs Napoletano' s call for the Italian Parliament to be monitored by the Council is irrelevant and devoid of any legal basis.
I would remind Mrs Napoletano and Mr Barón Crespo that the Italian Parliament is sovereign, like all the parliaments in consolidated democracies.
The statements of the Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists are, as far as we are concerned, extremely serious and unacceptable, for they amount to interference in the internal affairs of a Member State of the European Union.
And before making pronouncements on legislative affairs such as international letters rogatory, with which he is clearly unfamiliar, I would suggest that he read Article 3 of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed right here in Strasbourg, where he will find answers to his unfounded concerns: I would advise Mrs Napoletano, who also is clearly unfamiliar with this provision, to read it as well.
It would, in any case, be appropriate for the Chairman of a Parliamentary Group, and also for those holding positions of responsibility in the European institutions - I refer to the absent Mr Michel - not to make statements either of approval or condemnation in this Chamber on the internal affairs of a Member State.
Rather, we would like to hear what action the Belgian government intends to adopt, at last, to ensure the safety of the thousands of people who work within the European Parliament in Brussels, especially the staff based permanently on that site.
Declarations of intent must be followed by practical action.
Mr President, the conclusion and the action plan of the extraordinary Council offer a solid basis for a focused, measured, coordinated response to the attacks of 11 September.
The following are examples of the proposals which receive my full support: developing international judicial instruments, freezing the funding of terrorist networks and exchanging intelligence in conjunction with the US by setting up an anti-terrorist unit within Europol.
We are also pleased that the Council, the Commission and Parliament have spoken with one voice over the past three weeks, embarrassing slips by Commissioner Bolkestein and Prime Minister Berlusconi apart.
This suggests that European cooperation, both internally and externally, is growing up fast.
The weapon of new terrorism is fear and disruption, and hunger for power.
An effective line of attack protecting the international rule of law must spring from a worldwide coalition against terrorism under the aegis of the UN and on the basis of UN resolutions.
Provided that that coalition is based on international rule of law principles and not, as was the case in the past with the Taliban, by financing future enemies, for that is misguided Realpolitik.
I support a worldwide dignified response, irrespective of race, nationality or religion, proportional across the legal, political, diplomatic, financial, military and economic fields, whereby an appeal is made for extreme caution with regard to innocent lives.
Furthermore, we should not lose sight of the long-term perspective, particularly now.
Let there be no doubt about this: the direct causes of terrorism do not lie in creed or poverty.
In the climate of globalisation, there are certainly links between economic development, contrasting poverty and trade.
For example, the World Bank expects that, as a result of the terrorist attacks, economic growth in the developing countries will drop from 5% to 2%.
The expected effects are enormous, with ten million additional people under the poverty line and between twenty to forty thousand more children under the age of five who will die.
If we fail to formulate adequate responses in the face of this harsh reality, we in Europe will be applying double standards.
Investing in worldwide security means taking safety measures, but it also calls for international solidarity, which is a basis for international cooperation and, along with this, a basis for the worldwide coalition against terrorism.
Mr President, terrorism is a scourge attacking and afflicting our societies.
It resorts to violence and terror in an effort to impose its views by force. At the same time it attacks the very core of democratic systems, namely our system of individual and collective freedoms.
Terrorists are aware that our democratic societies are more open and consequently more vulnerable. They therefore resort to the advantages offered by globalisation.
It follows that the response to the terrorist phenomenon must likewise be a response at global level.
In this connection, I should like to congratulate the Presidency-in-Office on convening the Extraordinary European Council at Brussels and on placing terrorism on the agenda for the next Council.
I think congratulations are also due to the European Commission on the initiatives it has proposed.
On the basis that there is no good terrorism as against bad terrorism, I believe that terrorists the world over need to be aware that there will be international resistance to put an end to this scourge.
I also feel that it is important for us all to appreciate that the existing balance between an individual' s right to safety and the principles of legality and individual freedom which underpin our system of values cannot be altered.
It is very important for us to understand that the horrendous attacks perpetrated on 11 September must not result in the eventual dilution of the culture of freedom in democratic countries.
Mr President, I wish to concentrate my remarks on the issue of terrorism.
I welcome the fact that we are building a worldwide alliance against terrorism, but I would argue very strongly that we also need to build a worldwide alliance against poverty, exploitation and oppression.
The battle against terrorism is above all a battle of values and a battle of ideas.
We will not defeat terrorism, whether it be national terrorism, whether it be driven by fundamentalism of any kind, unless we do battle with the ideas that underpin that terror.
We have to recall again that no country has ever been defeated by terrorism and I am certainly confident that the terrorism which we now face on an international scale does not have that capacity unless we allow it by failing to grapple with the ideas underlying it.
This is not an argument for business as usual.
It is an argument for avoiding the trap set for us by terrorism.
We have to be careful also not to fall into the trap of seeing Muslims as an enemy.
The statements by our European leaders and President Prodi are very much welcome in this regard.
I condemn utterly the statements by Prime Minister Berlusconi.
It is a disgrace that a country of the European Union is led by a man who can present these ideas in this day and age, particularly when the country is Italy, which in my view has always led in terms of modern ideas.
I would add my voice to others' condemnations.
The question is how do we respond?
The very best response, apart from the obvious security measures that we have to take, is to defend our ideas of freedom, of democracy, of justice and of ending exploitation.
This European Union has a key role to play on the European stage in leading that battle and not falling into line behind those who only see security as an answer to this appalling problem.
Mr President, so much has now been said and written about the tragedy, the crime of 11 September.
I will, therefore, confine myself to three issues: terrorism, Europe and the world.
Yes, we must resolutely declare war on all forms of terrorism, from wherever it comes, the IRA, ETA, the assassins of Claude Erignac, Prefect of Corsica, Osama Bin Laden and his clique and all the others, but without making the stupid and suicidal mistake of lumping them all together.
Our capacity to take in terrorists is now beyond the limit; it is probable that the insane attacks of 11 September were prepared in Europe.
So, let us spring to action and pool our resources, our activities, our objectives in the field of intelligence, justice, security and defence and let us be implacable towards the terrorists, their networks, their support structures, their dirty money.
Yes, the Commissioner was quite right to refer to the obligation to get results!
Solidarity with our friends, our American allies, does not imply mindless alignment.
With its tried and tested experience of the world, Europe can and must play a specific role here.
Others place hope in us, await us, call on us, alas, too often without response.
Let us not disappoint them any longer.
In the Middle East, a constant source of tension, the issue has to be resolved by the establishment of two sovereign states - Israel and Palestine - with absolute security guarantees for both.
Even the Americans are, for the first time, considering this obvious arrangement.
It is up to us to initiate the process of opening the doors.
Let us finally realise that the post-Yalta organisation of the world needs to be rethought to take account of the incredible developments since the last war: the emergence of nuclear powers, whether official or not, the fall of the Berlin wall, more than a billion Muslims around the world desperately seeking recognition and respect, new giants like India, limitless technological developments in every field, developments that are accessible only to the few, the ever-widening gap between rich and poor.
Let us finally take account of these positive or disturbing trends and organise a world in which each individual is recognised, respected rather than despised, involved rather than ignored.
There is a burning need to fulfil that obligation.
Mr President, following the attacks on 11 September, it is incumbent upon us to come up with a response appropriate to this tremendous challenge, to ensure justice is done and to prevent further attacks.
Europe' s response must amount to more than the solidarity called for earlier in the House.
It must be an active response, defending specific values. I am not referring, as Mr Berlusconi might, to Western values or to Christian civilisation.
I have in mind genuine democratic values. These must be defended wherever the freedom to do so exists.
Where it does not, they must be established and nurtured. Success can only be guaranteed through long-term support by the governments committed to this fight.
In the face of the serious threat to humanity terrorism represents, we are called upon to take action and to get it right.
We must abide by the rules when taking action against those who have no rules.
We have to get it right, but getting it right cannot in this context mean taking spectacular action.
Getting it right has to mean identifying those responsible and dealing with the key figures.
It involves destroying their networks and preventing them from organising new ones. All this takes time, and calls for cooperation between judges and police at international level, together with mutual political trust between governments.
It will be a long and difficult process but believe me, it is the only way to defend democracy from fanaticism and barbarism.
A genuine common foreign security and defence policy for the European Union is called for.
The Union also needs a common approach to legal and home affairs. The European search and arrest warrant will be an essential element of this but by no means the only one.
Clearly, this joint European action requires us to set ourselves high standards.
No European leader should jeopardise the joint response, as Mr Berlusconi' s government has just done. The legislation it has recently endorsed is diametrically opposed to the approach adopted by this House.
It is also in opposition to the 21 September Council resolution we all applauded here today.
I should like to put some questions to the Council and the Commission.
What action will the Council take to ensure that it speaks with one voice, as Mr Michel was saying this morning? Also, how does it intend to deal with that thorn in its flesh, namely the Berlusconi doctrine?
Mr President, in light of the seriousness of the terrorist attack of 11 September, there are several important questions to be discussed and clarified, relating to our intention to resolutely fight terrorism.
The first question is the need to find effective means to combat terrorism, which do not necessarily entail legislative reform on matters of security.
It is worth recalling clearly that it is not effective, and never has been in democracy, to curtail freedoms in order to fight the enemies of democracy itself.
Indeed, we think the problem lies elsewhere.
It is not only the lack of legislation at national or European level, or the lack of coordinated policing at international level.
The problem has much to do both with hesitancy and weakness in the fight against terrorism, which manifest themselves in laxity towards activities of a terrorist nature, in the hope that terrorist acts would always be carried out in the country next door, or in the slow deterioration of methods of defence and security, police forces, information services and armed forces.
European governments which thought that wars had ended once and for all and which often cut the financial resources available for defence and safety cannot, of course, talk loudly about terrorism.
The second question concerns political awareness of the times in which we live.
If we denounce what happened in New York and Washington merely as a criminal act, we will from the start be limiting the scope, the meaning and the effectiveness of the fight against terrorism.
What happened is in reality an act of war, no doubt of a war different to previous wars but, unfortunately, all wars are different to previous wars.
They are usually more deadly, affecting more civilians and not hesitating to use any means to massacre. They are increasingly total wars.
To classify what happened as an act of war is not a mere question of semantics.
It has had major implications, starting with the right of the nation or nations affected to respond with military actions, if necessary, in relation to the country or countries shown to be responsible for supporting or carrying out terrorist acts.
At present this is a basic condition for effectively fighting terrorism, which cannot attain the magnitude of the attack of 11 September without the support of one or more States.
Unfortunately, there has been little discussion on this subject, but it is necessary to know the position of the Council, Parliament and the Commission concerning the need for military intervention against States which perpetrate or support terrorist acts.
Mr President, we all understand how fragile our society is when civil aircraft with people on their way to meet others are turned into bombs targeting citizens of the world in the metropolis of New York, a city in which people, at the start of their working day in the service industry or finance, become innocent victims of fanaticism and fiendishly well-organised terrorism which will stop at nothing to vent its hatred of the open, civilised and diverse society in which we live.
At the same time, however, all democrats throughout the world have realised that this open society is worth defending and that we have to work together to combat terrorism and lack of freedom.
US President George W. Bush has therefore, to his credit, been successful in creating global coalitions for freedom.
The UN, NATO and the EU have acted vigorously in this common struggle.
The common will in the European Union must manifest the ideals of the open society.
Let us not panic and introduce legislation which eliminates the principles of a state governed by law.
Do not let the protection of human rights be seen as incompatible with the fight against terrorism.
Do not let the prevailing mood be exploited for the purpose of closing borders or increasing prejudices between people.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, make sure that Ghent is used to strengthen the EU' s ability to promote the open society.
Trade is increasing links and understanding between the people of Europe and the rest of the world.
It is therefore disgraceful that certain countries in the EU are at present outside the common currency, which is one of our best tools for increasing partnership.
It is therefore also foolhardy of the Belgian Presidency to play the anti-globalisation game by bringing up the Tobin Tax, which would directly counteract economic recovery and increased trade.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Europe' s best long-term contribution to a more open, freer and safer world will be in terms of obtaining concrete results now on the reuniting of Western and Eastern Europe through enlargement.
You must not only handle an emergency and increasingly clear threats, but you must also fulfil the EU' s most important and historic task.
I wish you the best of luck in Ghent.
Mr President, I believe it to be clear in the aftermath of this terrorist attack that we need a far more integrated policy, not only as regards its European scope but also in respect of its content.
We must combine foreign and home affairs policy so as to take into account the worldwide nature of the enemy and their presence in our towns and cities.
Mrs Carlsson is quite right; we must not do it at the expense of abandoning the liberal state under the rule of law.
Another issue is that of how the causes of terrorism around the world are to be fought.
We know very well that none of these three aspects can any longer be coped with by the Nation State. Rather, it is only as a European community that we can get to grips with them and, to some extent, only together with the Atlantic Alliance and with our friends in North America.
I believe that we cannot be content with mere slogans, but, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that we must, through the post-Nice process and by pressing on, in Ghent and Laeken, with enlargement and so extending the zone of stability, create the practicalities, instruments and preconditions for, in time, casting what would have been mere slogans into durable forms enabling us to comply with these requirements.
It is for this reason that the preparation for Laeken, with a rationally conceived Convention, is of such decisive significance.
We must see clearly that in these fields too, technology is extraordinarily important.
We must ensure - and I am sure that you will take the right direction in your role as Belgian Presidency - a Convention that is workable and represents the necessary legitimisation, on the basis of which to present to the Heads of State and Government a document that will facilitate the really great reform of the European Union over and above the agenda laid down in Nice.
Please permit me a final word to the chairman of the PSE Group.
There is a difference between a person who is a Prime Minister and one who, like Mr Nielson, is a Commissioner and thereby subject to the European Parliament's immediate right of control.
If someone is directly subject to the European Parliament, it must be possible to express clear criticism of him here in this House and to call him to account if he talks nonsense, as he has done.
I have to tell you that the situation in Afghanistan, especially for the Afghan refugees, is tragic.
If we close our eyes and think of the impact this situation will have on millions of people, we, as the European Union, should really take action.
I believe it is of the utmost importance for the Council too - and I am addressing Mrs Neyts at this point - together with Parliament, to consider the question as to what we can do to make more resources available.
Mr President, if our humanitarian aid efforts do not run smoothly, we will create a new breeding ground for the Bin Ladens of this world.
It is therefore crucial to get it right.
I would like to denounce the statements made by Commissioner Bolkestein.
It is now the umpteenth time that he has acted beyond his remit.
He makes statements and gives an analysis in the Volkskrant of 29 September in which he says that the Arab world is indignant and feels weak vis-à-vis the West, partly as a result of the Gulf War.
But they are quite welcome to supply oil, he says.
Mr President, this analysis is not shared by Mr Patten.
Mr Bolkestein goes on to say that the EU' s asylum policy is not coming off the ground.
In my opinion, that is a direct attack on Mr Vitorino' s policy.
I would like to ask Mr Barnier to consult the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, on the matter of Mr Bolkestein adhering to his remit, being the internal market.
We cannot end up in a situation where the Commission as a whole would ultimately be harmed because it is judged on statements by Mr Bolkestein.
That is inopportune under these circumstances.
I think it is useful and necessary for the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and Mr Bolkestein to hold a discussion, with a view to the latter concentrating on his own task.
Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I fully share the sentiments of Mr Van Velzen concerning Mr Bolkestein.
As far as the debate on terrorism is concerned, I share the views of Messrs Van den Berg, De Rossa and others who have recommended a broader approach.
But since I was absent during the last debate, I would like to come back to it.
Following on from the debate on terrorism, I would like to add that we in Europe too must prevent grounds for frustration from developing or continuing to exist.
This is also relevant to enlargement.
Commissioner, it is vital for the political criteria of democracy, human rights and rights of minorities to be just as much respected as the quantitative aspects of enlargement.
With enlargement will come a number of small countries such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia and the Baltic States.
We therefore wonder what, in future, the place and rights of the constitutional regions will be, some of which see themselves as nations equivalent to others that have their own state.
They must be given their place.
Not only Flanders, but also Scotland, Wales, the Basque Country, Galicia and others spring to mind.
I am thinking of all those constitutional regions which might feel obliged to apply for Member State status, simply because Member States are the only States acknowledged within Europe.
In other words, if we fail in a future debate to give regions and nations a place in Europe, we in fact further separatism.
That is not what I want.
I would like regions to be able to help build a federal Europe, a federal Europe that is often curbed by the Member States themselves.
I would therefore urge you to include a paragraph on regions.
Mr President, at the close of this debate let me thank all the speakers, although I will not be able to reply to each one individually in the few minutes that remain.
Let me say, on behalf of the Commission, that I was touched by the support several of you gave to the work we are doing during these difficult and serious times, side by side with the Council and the European Parliament.
Turning to the most important issue, which almost all speakers addressed, the fight against terrorism, let me remind you of the spirit in which we are undertaking it.
We, and in particular my colleague and friend Mr Vitorino, take account in our activities of the important work done by Parliament, and in particular the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs under its chairman Mr Watson.
In fact we were working with that committee this morning on the final text submitted to you on freezing the assets of organisations linked to terrorism.
At this point, I can confirm that the Commission, like the Council, is prepared to take on board any suggestions or proposals from Parliament where at all possible.
To echo Mr Poettering's concern, let me repeat what I said in my statement this morning about the fight against terrorism. That fight certainly involves all the states; in no case can it be reduced to some kind of conflict between the different civilisations of the world.
As Mrs Béres and Mr Salafranca said, we must build a global alliance and wage a global fight against terrorism.
Let me also point out - in response to a number of speakers, Mr Lannoye, Mr Michel and Mr Di Lello - that we are most concerned during our activities with steering the best possible course between the need for freedom and the need for security.
Perhaps, as Mr Michel advised, it would be a good idea to carry out regular, careful evaluations to ensure that we remain on course.
I listened carefully to the recommendations of several Members, in particular Mr Collins, who called for determined and vigorous measures; I also noted the encouragement offered by Mr Berthu, calling on us to continue to work towards an objective that has clearly emerged since Amsterdam and since Tampere: a common judicial area, with the necessary cooperation between Member States and between all the services - and let me say to Mr Dupuis that I certainly mean all the services - and the necessary harmonisation or communitarisation in some areas.
Nor am I forgetting, just as you must not forget, that in Amsterdam and Tampere we also looked at ways of tackling illegal immigration.
Finally, on terrorism, as part of our collective action, we, the Commission, the Council and Parliament, must implement our common foreign policy by establishing a political dialogue, by preventing and stabilising all the regional conflicts, by giving marked support to development.
A number of you discussed this in relation to long-term action.
I am thinking here of Mr McMillan-Scott and Mr van Velzen.
And then, of course, in the shorter term, there are the support and cooperation measures to help the refugees.
Overall, looking at this serious challenge of fighting terrorism, let me emphasise what Mr Klaus Hänsch and, in a sense, Mr Nassauer said a moment ago.
We are facing a moment of truth and it is likely that the European Union will emerge stronger from this crisis in terms of the values and rationale of the European project.
As I said myself, it is also likely that we will have to step up the pace and find additional reasons for taking this European project further.
Ladies and gentlemen, even if it is difficult to explain this to you at this time of the day and with all this hubbub, I believe there is a link between, on the one hand, the political lessons we have to learn from this crisis and from the tragedy of New York and Washington, which tell us to speed up, to intensify, to prove once again the value of European integration and, on the other hand, that broad debate that began after Nice and is due to conclude in 2002.
There is a link with the activities the convention will have to undertake.
Speaking of that convention...
Ladies and gentlemen, it is appalling that Commissioner Barnier should be forced to end the debate on terrorism under these conditions.
It is a matter of responsible behaviour and manners. I therefore invite you all to take your seats and listen quietly.
I am sorry to be so harsh but this behaviour is truly unacceptable.
Mr President, unfortunately it was not I who chose the moment for my replies.
I have tried to be as precise as possible and to keep to the speaking time.
I will come to a close soon.
Nonetheless, turning to that convention, may I, following on from Mr Michel, establish that there is a link between the political debate that is beginning and the new dimension, the new gravity it has acquired as a result of the lessons we have learned from these tragic attacks.
I believe that the candidate countries must be given a place, the best possible place in this convention.
I believe the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions must be given a place as active observers.
I believe, as Mr Belder also suggested, that we must work as quickly as possible to bring this convention and the IGC that will conclude it to a close no later than the beginning of the year 2004.
I believe we will have to find a structured link between the citizens' forum with civil society and the activities of the convention.
Lastly, I believe that this convention must not confine itself to setting out the options but must be authorised or take it upon itself to make proposals.
Finally, addressing Mr Bonde, I do not share his fear about the convention.
I do not see why he should have any fears about its activities.
We have to learn from earlier weaknesses or failures.
I am speaking of the weaknesses of the intergovernmental method; indeed we saw its limitations before Amsterdam and before Nice.
We are fortunate to have time between now and 2004.
We are also fortunate to be able to work more openly with the four institutions, the four sources of legitimacy, in order to make the future Intergovernmental Conference a success.
So I believe that through that convention, the Ghent Summit, followed by the Laeken Summit, will confirm both our political ambition and our use of more transparent methods.
I apologise once again, Commissioner, for the conditions under which you were forced to speak.
Mr President, I think we should apologise to Commissioner Barnier, because it is intolerable, when we are discussing such grave matters, to see our Parliament not conducting itself in a courteous manner or listening to a particularly important statement.
I profoundly regret this and I would appeal to my colleagues' sense of responsibility.
The same has happened under other circumstances.
When we are holding such a weighty, such a serious debate, I think at the very least Members could keep quiet and show respect for the Commissioner by listening to him.
I believe we have a real problem of dysfunctional behaviour within this Parliament.
(Applause)
It is a question of irresponsible behaviour as well as poor administration.
Mr President, my card has disappeared.
I put it here on my seat and when I came back it was gone.
Someone has taken my card, meaning that I cannot vote.
Mr Patakis, you will have to go and get another voting card.
Mr President, the accusations made in this Chamber against the Italian Parliament by certain Members of this House represent an extremely dangerous precedent, in terms of both the democratic nature of this Parliament and the credibility of its decision-making process before the European public.
A Parliament which becomes a vehicle for accusations and a political campaign against another democratically elected parliament is nothing more than a forum for subversion, political racism and the intentional dissemination of inaccurate information.
I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37 (2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Mr President, for the whole week we have been unable to hear the original sound out of this system.
The acoustics in this Chamber are very, very poor.
This is not a new thing, though.
To add to that, we have been getting a terrible noise out of the loudspeaker today, which interferes with everything.
Because of the noise from the loudspeaker, we cannot hear anything.
Somebody must do something about this sound system.
I am sure your comment has been heard by all those who need to take action to resolve the issue as well as me.
I hope that they will do so without delay so that there will be no need for further speeches on the matter tomorrow.
Announcement by the President
The House has been requested to approve an extension of the deadline for the appointment of the members of the Court of Auditors.
The Council submitted the names of the candidates it has proposed for appointment as members of the Court of Auditors in two letters dated 22 and 28 June 2001 respectively.
These letters were received on the 27 and 28 June 2001 respectively, that is, just before the summer recess. For practical reasons, and to enable both the candidates and the members of the committee responsible to prepare the necessary hearings, the hearings were planned for 11 September and 8/10 October 2001.
Rule 35(3) provides that the vote in plenary is held within two months of receipt of the nomination, unless Parliament, at the request of the committee responsible, a political group or at least 32 Members, decides otherwise.
In view of the fact that the debate and vote in plenary are planned for the October II part-session, that is, after the two-month deadline laid down in Rule 35, the committee responsible has submitted a request that the House be asked to approve an extension of this deadline.
Are there any objections?
Then it is decided to postpone the deadline.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
VOTE
Mr President, this first vote on our order paper today relates to the request from the Commission for urgent procedure on the measure you have outlined.
In exceptional circumstances, following the attack on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, the Committee on Citizens' Freedom and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs met this morning and approved, without report, the proposal submitted to us.
I understand that we will also receive, following this morning's Coreper meeting, a request from the Council for urgency, to add to that from the Commission.
It is the recommendation of the committee, which I have the honour to chair, that we accept that amendment.
If that is approved by the House, I hope you will confirm that would give the political groups until 6 p.m. this evening to submit amendments to this proposed measure.
Are there any objections?
Mr President, I was present at the committee' s meeting this morning, and I would therefore like to add to what the Chairman, Mr Watson, has said.
There was substantial concern regarding precisely the request for urgency - there were even three votes cast against the motion and three abstentions - because we are being asked to approve an urgent procedure not on the mechanism for identifying money launderers but on a list.
It is with regard to this fact that we expressed our opposition.
(Parliament adopted the request for urgent procedure)
Mr President, I too should like to protest in the strongest terms against the uproar during Commissioner Barnier's speech and to say that I share Mrs Grossetête's indignation.
However, this is not the first time this has happened and I should like to propose a practical solution to the problem, because otherwise there is nothing left for us to do but apologise to the Commissioners.
I think there should be quarter of an hour's break between the end of the debate and the vote.
Mr President, I had expected to recommend the House to adopt this draft regulation unamended at second reading.
That depended, however, on a statement from the Commissioner last night.
Unfortunately, the statement by Mrs de Palacio was insufficient.
However, I would now like to ask the Commission again whether it will undertake to bring in measures complementary to this agreement in the first three months of next year.
This is the only commitment which we will accept as reasonable, otherwise I will ask the House to vote for the amendment and to invoke the conciliation procedure.
I therefore ask the Commission to clarify its position on supplementary measures.
In any case, Mrs McNally, I should have asked for the Commission' s opinion on the amendments tabled.
I therefore now give the floor to Commissioner Barnier.
Mr President, last night at the close of the debate and on the basis of the supporting studies, Commissioner Bolkestein clearly contradicted those who say that prices rose after the introduction of the Community exhaustion system.
On the contrary, in some cases they fell.
Those who pretend they are defending the consumer are in fact protecting the parallel import circuits that pose a threat to quality, innovation and jobs by promoting counterfeits.
Hence the three amendments I tabled.
They seem to worry the rapporteur. In fact the PPE-DE Group has called for a roll-call vote on all our amendments to check how its members are voting and the undertakings given by certain coordinators.
I fear that once again pressure and bargaining will carry the day and that a bad decision will be taken.
Mr Bernié, you requested the floor to tell me whether you are withdrawing the amendments.
This is not the place for political reasoning or an explanation of vote. Please would you tell me whether you withdraw the amendments or not.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the process of drafting European law should concentrate on fundamental issues rather than pointlessly wasting time and energy on details.
This was written by Mr Prodi in a guest column in the 'Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung' on 27 July this year.
I indeed hear this gospel, but I have no faith!
The Miller report is evidence to the contrary, defining things that are self-explanatory.
It tells us, for example, what a floor is, what is meant by 'behind' and 'in front' and informs us that provision must be made for passages through which two coaxial cylinders must be able to pass.
The whole thing is actually absurd, but - and here I refer back to the quotation from Romano Prodi - Europe's citizens will rightly ask themselves whether we have nothing more important to occupy us.
It was therefore with extreme annoyance that I took part in this brief vote on the Miller report.
In many spheres, the imagination of regulators is positively inexhaustible.
Yet there is a lack of real political will where really explosive legal issues are concerned.
It will not be in that way that we will bring Europe and its citizens closer together.
The freedom of movement on which this European Union is founded is daily denied to our continent's 37 million disabled citizens.
There is no more important question in the campaign for comprehensive human rights for disabled people than the pursuit of accessible public transport.
The directive finally agreed today, is a historic step forward in that campaign.
It shows that the cost of access for industry is affordable, if only designed-for-all principles are included at the beginning.
It shows that European regulation really can make a difference in enforcing rights for disabled people.
Above all, it shows that eleven years of tireless campaigning by the disability movement, by Buses for All in my own country the UK, was absolutely worthwhile, necessary and ultimately victorious.
Congratulations to all of you.
I am proud that the European Parliament has helped deliver your demands.
de Roo report (A5-0296/2001)
Mr President, the report by our Green colleague, Alex de Roo, will no doubt mark a milestone in the European Union's environmental legislation. Until now, we had an almost total legislative silence about the environmental damage caused by noise.
Our parliaments lent a deaf ear, although this in no way reflected the real-life experience of the citizens of the Union.
More than a quarter of them, one hundred million, believe they are the victims of noise and the economic repercussions of this noise in the environment oscillates at between EUR 10 and 40 billion.
So we can only welcome the pioneering measures set out in this report. We do indeed need to introduce noise mapping.
It is as necessary and salutary as the mapping of dangerous sites, which we now realise, all too late, is a vital measure.
This information is useful only if it is given to the public quite transparently. It is meaningful only if it is constantly updated in terms of geography and choice of indicators.
Lastly, identifying these noise nuisances will only be useful and effective if it is accompanied by penal and coercive measures against the noise-makers, be they civil, public or military. Over and above these practical imperatives, we can really only combat euro-noise today if we do so at European Community level.
We therefore continue to call for common European standards.
Noise respects no frontiers; noise penetrates every wall, resounds through every space.
We therefore urged all our parliamentary colleagues to support this report and we welcome the outcome.
Noise pollution reaches us in diffuse, sporadic and intangible ways; often it even forms part of our daily environment.
Noise is not as black as oil, or as acrid as chemical waste; yet it is just as harmful, in condensed form.
I hope therefore that the demands set out in this report will not be regarded simply as sound and fury but that the European Union will manage to make them resound for a long time.
- (FR) We voted for all the amendments calling for limits to noise pollution caused by road, rail or air transport or for imposing binding and uniform noise ceilings throughout the European Union.
At the same time, we reject the arguments about competitiveness put forward by transport firms. The crucial factors must be safety and limiting noise levels, not competitiveness.
We also voted for the amendments fixing shorter deadlines for implementing these measures. What is the point of deciding to take measures in the interest of society if the implementing date is put off to a more or less indeterminate future time, to enable special interests to find a way round them?
- (FR) We know what an impact noise emissions can have on the daily life and the health of our fellow-citizens.
But Europe must not come along and act as a kind of noise extinguisher to make up for mistakes in land use planning.
I am not calling the general objective into question; but if our action is to be effective, it must be pragmatic, like the action we took on air quality.
It is not up to Europe to introduce unilateral standards and impose them on everybody throughout its territory with no regard for specific local conditions.
Europe is already intervening in relation to tyres, aircraft engines, road surfaces...
It is important for the measures to take account of these territorial disparities.
Europe must do more to make the Member States aware of their responsibilities here, it must urge the local authorities to take the necessary measures on the basis of the local situation, rather than deciding on their behalf.
In this case I subscribe to the principle of subsidiarity.
Let us take airports as an example: it would be ineffective to set uniform noise limits for all airports.
Conditions vary widely from one airport to another. Each airport is unique (runway configuration, distribution of traffic and so forth).
The impact of aircraft noise differs from one airport to another and it would make more sense to take measures to reduce noise emissions at national, regional and local levels.
Moreover, it seems quite incredible to find no distinction drawn between international and regional airports!
Nor should we forget that airports are important to the area concerned.
Air transport infrastructure is a vital factor in industries' choice of where to locate their plant, and therefore vital in terms of jobs too.
Let me also remind you that the title of the directive is 'Noise evaluation and management'.
So evaluation comes before management.
How can one think of fixing limit values without first carrying out a precise, horizontal study, based on agreed, common evaluation criteria?
Furthermore, the first stage would be to set up a system for evaluating noise levels in the different Member States and to draw exact noise maps region by region.
Only when this information is available should Member States be encouraged to formulate an effective action plan, working together with all the local authorities and elected representatives.
.
(NL) In densely populated urban areas, the traffic noise and the noise around airports, in particular, is a disaster.
People' s night rest is increasingly being threatened by continuous noise.
Unfortunately, the Council and the Commission' s standpoint still harks back to the first half of the twentieth century, a time when cities, traffic and the economy were on a much smaller scale and growth was still welcome.
That is apparent from, among other things, the fresh attempts to protect the position of airline companies.
Instead of tackling overcapacity by imposing a tax on fuel, thus removing the competitive edge compared with more environmentally-friendly modes of transport, there is now a renewed attempt to reduce the tax burden for the sake of continued growth in air traffic and airports.
Mr De Roo is right - also at second reading - to adhere to previous choices made by Parliament with regard to the restriction of night-time pollution, short terms, clear definitions of noise pollution, and daughter directives on noise emissions of lorries, buses, motorcycles, trains and aircraft.
It is now only the need for a majority of 314 votes to break the opposition that threatens to lead to a long-term stalemate.
- (FR) I wanted to explain just why I voted for this report as amended.
Firstly, I believe it adopts a balanced position and takes account of the well-being and health of the citizens who are, indeed, being more and more exposed to noise pollution.
With regard to the substance, I agree with the Commission's idea of harmonising the noise indicators and the methods of evaluating ambient noise.
Next, thanks to these common indicators and evaluation methods, it will indeed be possible to compile information on noise exposure, in the form of 'noise maps' without, at least for the moment, fixing noise limit values for the entire European Union.
Moreover, I wanted to continue excluding military airports from the scope of the framework directive.
I am glad no amendment calling for their inclusion was tabled at second reading.
I am also satisfied with the deadline for incorporating the directive into national law (30 June 2003) and for proposing the daughter directives that will ensue (namely three years after the entry into force of the framework directive).
However, let me emphasise that the subsidiarity principle must be respected fully and that Member States must have some margin for manoeuvre, based on common indicators and methods, so that they can take account of special factors (different geographical situations, for example) especially in relation to airports.
Joint resolution on the accident in Toulouse
- (FR) While expressing our indignation at the accident at the AZF factory in Toulouse and its terrible consequences, as also our solidarity with the victims and their families, we have not associated ourselves with the joint resolution, to show that we do not condone the hypocrisy of discussing this disaster without implicating the TotalFinaElf trust, the owner of that plant.
This trust puts profit first, that is, the profits of its shareholders, to the detriment of safety. It did not take all the necessary measures to avoid an accident happening or, at any rate, to prevent it having such tragic consequences for the factory workers and the local population.
Furthermore, we refuse to join in the congratulations addressed to the French authorities. These authorities, from the town council to the government, were not able or not willing to take steps to check the AZF factory in Toulouse properly, as is also true of the many other high-risk sites, and to force the TotalFinaElf trust and its ilk to take the essential precautions.
As for providing 'appropriate aid...to the populations affected', even after the accident, that assistance did not match the scale of the damage.
The sum of one and a half billion released by the government will cover only a quarter of the damage caused.
How long will those who have lost their homes and are living in precarious conditions have to wait to be housed?
However, quite apart from the fact that this aid is inadequate, the taxpayer was supposed to pay it.
Why should the taxpayers have to use their money to pay for the damage for which TotalFinaElf is to blame?
That company should pay for this in full, including of course the total wages of the workers forced out of work, both at AZF and its subcontractors and in all the local firms that had to shut down.
. (EL) The catastrophe in Toulouse, a tragic accident indeed, should give us an incentive to overhaul the Community directive on highly dangerous installations and ensure that it is applied more strictly.
We all know that numerous Member States of the EU have not applied the revised 'Seveso' directive, even though they should have been doing so since 1999.
Even worse, a number of countries are clearly not even applying the original 'Seveso' directive properly.
I am delighted that our joint resolution calls on the Commission to publish a table, within the next three months, of all the industrial plants in the EU which are highly dangerous and are located in residential areas and which, were an accident to happen, could cause damage on a scale similar to that caused by the accident in Toulouse.
One such plant, Petrola Hellas plc, is located a stone's throw from the densely populated areas of Elefsina, Aspropyrgo and Mandra and has already applied for planning permission to extend over a 130 hectare plot of land located in the buffer zone between the current Petrola plant and the Pyrkal munitions factory.
I should also like to point out that, according to witnesses working in the factory in question, the factory operator has not provided the public with the safety report or the emergency plans setting out action to be taken in the event of an accident, as required under the Seveso directive.
Other factories in the area are guilty of similar practices (no plans, failure to inform local authorities and the public).
The usual procedure is to send a very basic file to the ministry and ignore the rest of the provisions of the Seveso directive.
Just how interested and concerned the Greek authorities are in preventing major disasters and limiting their impact is obvious from the environment Commissioner's reply to my question on the matter.
The Commissioner replied that he had written to the Greek authorities on 7 June 2000 asking for information on the extension to the Petrola plant but that the Greek authorities had not yet replied to the letter in question.
- (FR) Following Monday's statement by Mrs Christine de Veyrac, Deputy Mayor of Toulouse, I want to express the sympathy and solidarity of the entire French delegation of the PPE-DE Group towards our compatriots struck by disaster at the AZF factory in Toulouse, and, in particular, towards the victims and their families.
Let me also pay tribute to all those who responded with such extraordinary courage and provided help, medical care and assistance to all the many victims.
Information to date suggests that this was an accident, although it is too early to be entirely sure.
If that is indeed the case, we will have to check whether all the necessary safety measures and precautions were taken, given that this factory was classified as presenting a major industrial risk.
The real question is to find out whether the provisions of the 1982 and 1986 Seveso directives, which provide for all the necessary procedures and all the danger scenarios, are being observed on such sites in the European Union and to check whether the risk reports are updated on a regular basis.
We also need to check whether the plans are operational and tested, whether the national administrations have the means of inspecting all these installations and whether the no-construction zones are being respected.
Above all, we must learn from this tragedy that has struck the inhabitants of Toulouse, to ensure that in future the people of the European Union are protected once and for all from such terrible explosions.
Evans Robert J.E. report (A5-0304/2001)
I voted in favour of this report, but I am disappointed that some of the most important aspects were rejected.
It seems that Parliament does not accept the common definition of a refugee, based on the full inclusive definition, which would cover gender-related persecution, include both state and non-state persecution and take account of the applicant's fear of further persecution.
I cannot see how people can justify voting against such principles.
In relation to the issue of a safe country of origin I do not think there is such a thing as a safe country anywhere.
For certain people in certain sections of society, there is a danger in any country.
In Ireland we have signed a bilateral agreement with Romania and Nigeria and we are planning to sign more such agreements in the future so that we can speed up the procedure of deportation.
This really falls short of what we are required to do under international law.
Individuals are not being treated as individuals, they are being treated as groups coming from the country concerned.
The idea of a safe country, the idea that governments can actually claim that certain countries are safe, is quite incredible.
We have to remember that there is no such thing as a safe country for certain people.
- (FR) We voted against the Evans report, which echoes the main Commission position on the common asylum procedure.
Like the Commission, the rapporteur believes this procedure should be refocused towards giving greater right of asylum to applicants who want 'to find safety'.
We already established, at the last part-session, what practical consequences this policy would have, when we considered the Commission's proposal on minimum standards for the procedure for granting refugee status.
It quite simply overlooks the fact that today the right of asylum is being distorted and manipulated to such an extent that it has become a if not the prime source of illegal immigration.
How many applications are unfounded?
Probably nine out of ten.
The Commission forgets these figures, just as it minimises the total number of applications, which it puts at 200 000 for the entire EU in 2000, while according to the figures we have it was as much as 375 000, counting only 10 out of the 15 EU countries! This underestimate is made deliberately.
It allows the problem to be minimised. In fact it is immense.
The member countries must not accept the Commission's proposals, for they would constrain them to observe a common procedure that would start out flexible, only to become increasingly rigid, as is clearly stated on page 8 of the communication.
That procedure would end up by granting unlimited rights of asylum and, in addition, broaden the concept of 'refugee' set out in the 1951 convention by extending it to other forms of temporary protection.
All this is totally ill-timed.
The Commission would do better to present us with proposals for establishing a policy on the return of applicants whose claim has been rejected.
It would also do better to present us with proposals aimed at giving priority to assisting refugees in their region of origin.
- (DA) The report' s detailed requests to the Commission and the Council are based upon an appealing ambition to improve legal protection for asylum seekers in relation to the rights applicable under the Convention and particularly with regard to the procedure for dealing with asylum seekers.
The proposals could therefore mean a long overdue strengthening of legal protection in our own countries.
We also find it encouraging that the proposal seeks the reasons why refugees are persecuted.
Even though we are able to endorse by far the majority of the report' s recommendations, we have not been able to vote in favour of the report, partly because quite a few of the proposals are too vague and partly - and especially - because the proposals are based upon asylum and immigration policy' s being defined supranationally by the EU.
These policy areas are a part of the Member States' own area of responsibility and ought not to be (mis)used to construct a supranational policing and legal system.
- (FR) First of all I want to thank both Mr Robert Evans, our rapporteur in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and the committee as a whole for the quality of the work they have done and for the courageous social choices they have asked us to make today.
In my view, voting for this report means, above all, endorsing the ambitious approach set out by the Tampere European Council, namely not just the statement that 'in the longer term, Community rules should lead to a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for those granted asylum valid throughout the Union', but also the commitment of that same Tampere European Council to the 'full and inclusive' interpretation of the Geneva Convention.
In other words, to vote for this report means to support the idea that a common asylum policy must adhere to high standards for the protection of the refugees, include a common definition of the concept of 'refugee' and give a full and inclusive interpretation of the Geneva Convention, taking account of persecution both by state and by non-state agents, as well as the asylum seekers' fear of future persecution.
I therefore believe it is important to draw your attention to the fact that the common, 'full and inclusive' interpretation of the Geneva Convention must include the possibility of granting asylum in cases where the persecution is not carried out by the state.
The Member States take many different views on this particular point.
In other words, the further development of the common policy calls for further harmonisation of procedures throughout the Union.
We must, however, note that while it is important to encourage this kind of single procedure, this must not restrict the possibilities for the individual to obtain refugee status under the terms of the Geneva Convention.
In my view, voting for this report also means emphasising the fact that the use of concepts such as 'safe third countries', 'safe country of origin', 'accelerated procedures' and 'procedures for manifestly unfounded applications' must only be used where justified and include legally binding guarantees.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
. (EL) The two reports, one on the procedure for granting asylum to refugees and the other on ÅU immigration policy are in fact both an attempt to deal with the same problem.
The problem of the influx into the Member States of the ÅU of people who have lost everything, of people who are in danger in their own country, either because they are being politically persecuted or for reasons of economic survival.
Reports and other EU documents on the matter always contain a paragraph referring to the need to combat the causes of asylum-seeking and immigration.
Of course, what they fail to mention is the criminal responsibility of imperialism, which has exploited the natural and human resources of third world countries for centuries and which has no hesitation in setting up and bringing down what are usually authoritarian governments in order to serve its economic interests.
The furious struggle of the imperialist forces to overturn Socialism, the war which they ignited in the Balkans and the recent tragic example of the war planned against their own Taliban and Bin Laden resulted and will continue to result in millions of unfortunate people hanging about in the countries of the ÅU and elsewhere, looking for a place in the sun.
Consequently, we should have no delusions about the fact that, as long as imperialism prevails, asylum-seeking and immigration will live and rule.
So the question is, how can we manage the problem better?
In this respect, the Evans report on granting asylum contains a number of positive points and proposals.
However, it is still a wish list.
For example, it quite rightly points out that the concept of 'safe' countries of origin or 'safe' third countries is very fluid and the danger here is that people will be deported to countries in which they are at risk, that is, they will literally be sent into the lion's den.
A typical example is Turkey, a candidate country, which the ÅU considers has made steady progress in the field of human rights.
In reality, as we all know, people are imprisoned in Turkey for their ideas, hunger strikers and other people fighting for democracy are murdered, parties which represent millions of Kurds or opponents of the regime (such as the Communist party) are banned, trade unionists are arrested and so on.
And yet there are countries in the ÅU, including Greece, which deport opponents of the regime to this 'safe' country.
As far as the conditions of survival of refugees are concerned, a typical example is Greece, where thousands of Kurds live in shanty towns in Lavrio and Afghans and other refugees sleep in cardboard boxes on the beaches in Athens, deprived of even the basic necessities.
Likewise, the report quite rightly highlights the huge delay in processing asylum applications and the fact that the Member States are unwilling to grant asylum.
In Greece, for example, an average of 5% a year are approved and only this year did this rise to 7%.
We shall vote in favour of the Evans report because it proposes improvements to the current system of protection for refugees.
However, we feel that only solidarity and a united fight by both refugees and workers in the Member States of the ÅU in a bid to claim dignified living conditions for everyone and, more to the point, wipe out the reasons for refugees and poverty will provide a definitive solution to the problem.
.
(NL) Huge discrepancies between the rich and poor in the world encourage migration, which only solves the problem for a small number of people and not for humanity as a whole.
It is often the best educated and the most privileged who manage to enter Europe, often at the expense of useful roles they could be playing in their countries of origin.
Such individual solutions, however, are necessary to those whose only chance of survival is to flee from war and suppression.
It is not acceptable to send people to their deaths by establishing quota and to refuse access to others.
Neither is it justifiable to send people back before the problem in their country of origin has been solved.
Moreover, some refugees will want to stay on because their children and grandchildren have meanwhile been raised in the new country of residence.
Some EU Member States admit many more refugees than others.
It is remarkable that both those in favour of restricting and those in favour of extending the permits have for years been calling for a more centralised and standardised European policy.
I can only agree with this if it means that the EU Member States will be more generous in applying minimum standards than those agreed in the Geneva Convention.
It is easier to organise and supervise the protection of refugees on a small scale than by a remote bureaucracy.
- (FR) According to Article 1 of the Geneva Convention, refugee status applies to anyone who rightly fears being persecuted on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership of a certain social group or political opinions, is outside the country of his or her nationality and cannot, or because of that fear will not, seek the protection of that country.
It is time that the Member States of the European Union applied that Convention in full.
Yet France, in its hypocrisy, refuses to grant that status to Algerian refugees.
In the same way Europe refused, at the height of the war in Kosovo, to give refugee status to Serbian deserters or to the Kosovars who were being persecuted.
How many Bosnians are still mouldering in refugee camps in Turkey because the Union has refused to take them in?
How many Afghan refugees are flocking to Sangatte in the hope of getting to England because they know they have no chance in the Schengen area?
However, despite these reservations, because the text proposes minimum standards for receiving asylum seekers (a minimum level of assistance, such as the provision of full legal aid, at public expense, to each applicant, or justification, by the authority or by the court, of any rejection of a refugee' s application, as well as specific aid for vulnerable persons), we shall be voting in favour.
Pirker report (A5-0305/2001)
I voted against this report.
It sends out the wrong signals.
It suggests that Europe will take in the people it wants, the people it needs; in other words, human beings are being classified as commodities that certain Member States will want.
This goes against all the international principles of basic human rights.
It suggests that people who have a certain trade or a certain profession can come in, but other people who may desperately need to get in are not allowed in.
This whole policy is completely restrictive.
In relation to the idea that we all have to share the burden of quotas, that immigrants are a burden, that we must all spread this burden, that immigrants are not people at all, that they are basically problems, this report sends out completely the wrong signals.
It establishes the concept of a fortress Europe whose door will be open to a privileged few.
Mr President, I share some, if not all, of Mrs McKenna's reservations on the Pirker report.
However, I voted in favour of this report on a common immigration policy, but with an extremely heavy heart.
I did so because although the report as amended is, as we would say in English, all over the place - some points do not correspond with others and there are contradictions left, right and centre - there are a few (and I am sure Mrs McKenna will look at them) but significant positive aspects to the report.
For example, it recognises the right of third-country nationals legally resident in the European Union to free movement in Europe.
Equally, it gives the right to vote in local elections.
However, there are negative aspects.
I doubt whether all the people who voted for paragraph 35 could have read it, because it restricts the right of residence, accommodation and education.
That is inherently racist and we should oppose it.
However, to have rejected the report would have placed in jeopardy the positive points; hence my support, although with the reservations I have expressed clearly here.
Mr President, the Pirker report is extremely important because it includes certain declarations of principle which we consider to be fundamental and to clarify the issue: firstly, the principle that immigrants are expected to respect the Community of values, as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and to have a genuine desire to be integrated into the society of the Member States.
Today, let us grasp the full extent of the now tragic dimensions of the danger represented by different 'values' which are opposed to the values common to our societies and to our traditions, which have been introduced and disseminated, so to speak, by illegal immigration linked to Islamic fundamentalism within our societies.
Among these values, I would like to focus on those relating to family relationships, family rights, and I would like to take this opportunity to tell you about the tragedy of two Italians - mother and daughter - who were forced to take refuge at the Italian embassy in Algiers and approached Parliament, asking us to protect their fundamental rights, violated precisely by those people who adhere to the opposing principles of Islamic law.
Furthermore, another principle: the recognition that every State has the right ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
. (EL) New rules for the waves of immigrants heading for the European Union, calculating the needs of the countries of entry and procedures for integrating third country nationals into society in the European Union are, without doubt, moves in the right direction.
However, the Commission communication on an 'immigration policy' contains omissions and additional objectives need to be promoted. To be specific, we need:
to clarify the difference between the terms 'working immigrant' and 'economic immigrant' and avoid the risk of creating new forms of discrimination based on the narrow interests of the job market in Europe;
to accept family reunification in general and not as a special characteristic of certain categories of immigrants;
to extend mobility within the ÅU for immigrants with a legal resident's permit;
to combat human trafficking gangs;
a strategy to facilitate the return of specialised immigrants in order to strengthen productive capacity in their country of origin;
to abolish discrimination between immigrants on the basis of sex, age, sexual orientation or disability;
to create a European network for immigration as an observatory and census mechanism.
This being the case, I voted against the report.
The Pirker report on Community immigration policy has just been made worse by the adoption of Amendment No 17 which claims voting rights for foreign nationals in local elections.
In any case, despite Mr Pirker' s laudable efforts, this report is ambiguous in the way it is worded in general, because it does not dare to say clearly that the Commission' s approach, in its communication on immigration, is wrong.
First of all, to a large extent it hides the phenomenon of illegal immigration, and it proposes only partial or distant solutions.
In particular, the approach involving co-development with the countries of origin will no doubt be of value in the long term, but it does not mean that we do not need to strengthen our border controls now.
Moreover, the Commission is more or less opening the floodgates to legal immigration.
It says that European policy should be based on the fact that migratory pressure will continue (page 14), and from this it draws the conclusion that legislation should be designed so as to facilitate, rather than hinder, the admission of economic migrants (page 19).
We, however, do not draw that conclusion at all. On the contrary, we believe that a quota policy should be adopted, with quota levels determined by each Member State on its own behalf, and in our opinion those quotas should be filled, as a matter of priority, by nationals of countries in Eastern Europe, who will soon be members of the Union.
On the subject of the integration of immigrants, the Commission invites us to recognise that integration is a two-way process requiring adaptation by both the immigrants and the society that receives them (page 21).
This is not our opinion either.
The strangers who come knocking at our door more often than not come from countries which have completely failed to let their population live decently, or even to feed it.
It is obviously in the immigrants' interest to adjust to our way of life and our values.
To take the opposite view would be to do them a great disservice, and it would also, in return, do a great disservice to the countries of Europe.
.
(PT) The report comments on a Commission communication on immigration, adopted in November 2000, which considers the issue from a mainly economic perspective, linked to job prospects, which may create the conditions for establishing immigration quotas in the European Union.
It appears that the European Union is only interested in using labour from third countries to meet the needs and shortages of European capitalism, indifferent to the obstacles this may create to those countries' own development by depriving them of vital human resources.
It is, therefore, crucial that we find a new perspective on cooperation and development policy, particularly with third countries, in order to contribute towards greater support for their development and provide their populations with decent standards of living, something which the report, unfortunately, does not touch upon.
With regard to immigrants, it is important to guarantee and respect all their rights.
Hence the proposals we submitted on upholding the legalisation of all immigrants, our insistence on the need for recognition of civil and political rights, namely the right to vote in local and European elections and the guarantee of equal treatment in terms of economic, cultural and social rights.
- (FR) I voted in favour of Mr Pirker' s report and I would like to draw attention to the quality of the work carried out by our rapporteur.
I am glad that Parliament is finally taking a decision on such an important subject.
For almost twenty years, immigration as a subject of public debate has been treated only emotionally or unrealistically.
How could it have been otherwise, when the subject has virtually become a major stake in the internal policy of every Member State of the European Community?
It also has to be admitted that, in the eyes of the public, the policies being followed are, on the one hand, inefficient when it comes to combating illegal immigration and, on the other, unjust in the case of proper immigration which is legal and useful to the development of our society.
It has now become vital to make a clear distinction, both in law and in practice, between proper immigration and improper immigration, and finally to define criteria and then stick to them.
While several international and European organisations all emphasise the risk of shortages of qualified workers in Europe, we must learn to adapt, like certain Anglo-Saxon countries, and open up European society to the immigrants that it so badly needs in several sectors, including informatics and new technologies.
To conclude, real courage consists in campaigning for deep-seated change in the world economic order.
Justice and ethics would then count for much more than they do in the moralising extremism of those who would like to demand total freedom to live and work in Europe, like those who would like to turn our European Community into a mere sanctuary.
- (FR) In the light of the recent dramatic events of 11 September 2001 in the United States of America, the fight against illegal immigration into Europe should, more than ever, be our chief concern.
It is time to stop letting all these illegal immigrants in and put an end to the free movement of traffickers and terrorists within the Union.
We must show some instinct for survival.
Terrorist cells have recently been identified in various Member States of the Union, in particular in France and Belgium, among illegal immigrants.
Since the opening up of borders and the Schengen Agreements, some immigrant communities have systematically organised themselves into networks of religious and ethnic infiltration, and as a result they are a fertile breeding ground for terrorism, and also for delinquency, trafficking and violent crimes of all kinds.
Yet what, in the face of all this, is Brussels' policy?
It closes its eyes and ignores the evil.
At the very best it feebly condemns the constant increase in international crime.
So what are its solutions?
Encourage immigration, legalise illegal immigrants, give identity papers to all those who have entered our territory illegally, create and allow the creation of no-go areas where the law does not apply, such as the Sangatte Centre in France.
Broadly speaking, that is what is being preached by the report that we are voting on.
It tells us that we must populate Europe because Europe has a population deficit. Europe needs manpower, so in order to meet that need we must have a global and voluntary immigration policy.
The National Front Députés have for years been constantly denouncing this irresponsible and suicidal policy coming from Brussels.
The fight against illegal immigration must clearly be based on the principle of zero tolerance.
Illegal immigrants must be sent back to their country of origin.
Our borders must be re-established, because proof has finally been given to all signatory parties to the Schengen Agreements that those borders are an essential element in the security of our countries.
Therefore, before committing ourselves to a Community immigration policy, let us start by establishing a Community security policy.
We are critical of parts of the report.
In our opinion, there is too great an emphasis placed on what should be done to limit immigration, instead of highlighting the positive and necessary aspects of increased immigration, including the immigration of labour.
In several cases, we should like to go further with regard to becoming more receptive to increased labour migration.
We are particularly critical of Paragraph 15, which states that 'immigrants are expected to respect the community of values - as set out in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights - and to show a willingness to integrate into society in the Member States' .
We do not currently require the citizens of Europe to respect the community of values referred to in the report.
The question is how this paragraph will actually be interpreted.
A wave of anti-Muslim sentiment is currently sweeping across Europe.
In Sweden and in several other Member States, Muslims have been harassed.
Politicians in individual Member States have, in our opinion, made some astonishing statements.
Our concern is that the wording of Paragraph 15 is in danger of providing further scope for intolerance and xenophobia.
There is a risk that the diversity of Europe could be lost.
- (FR) The debates that have just taken place in the present session on the Pirker report, and indeed on the Evans report, represent a double departure from the debates previously held within the European Parliament on the same subjects.
The first of these departures is the new tone of firmness and rigour demonstrated both by the presidency and even by the Commission.
The events of 11 September have something to do with that.
The ideology of 'fewer and fewer controls' has given way to the realisation that terrorism feeds on our laxity.
It is not by chance that the Europe of the Fifteen, the European Union, has emerged from the inquiry into the killings of 11 September as being the privileged location for the organisation, preparation and mounting of the terrorist attacks in the United States.
It is necessary now for the good intentions just expressed by the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commission to be translated into action and sustained in the long term.
It is, in fact, high time that the fight against illegal immigration and the fight against the abuse of the asylum procedure should no longer be mere formulae to be bandied about, but should become policies to be implemented with determination.
The second departure is more distressing.
This is the obvious discrepancy that has appeared between the new tone of the Council and the Commission, which is a positive signal of awareness, and the persistence of an ideological attitude among most of the Members who have spoken, which continues to confuse control with violation of freedoms, and which wants to increase the number of guarantees to the benefit of those who are abusing our reception and asylum procedures, to the detriment of the security and protection of our citizens and the interests of those who, because they really are being persecuted, ought to find asylum here.
Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to clarify the reasons why my group voted in favour of the Pirker report.
In our view it is of the utmost importance that the Commission' s communication be favourably received.
The Laeken Council has the political duty of revitalising the process launched by the Tampere European Council.
As evidenced by the data supplied by EUROSTAT, the citizens believe that the European Union must adopt a common immigration policy.
Amongst other provisions, our group has included the right of long-term residents to vote in local elections. We have also contrived to build in clearly defined responsibilities for the European Union.
For all these reasons, and also to express our strong support for the Commission, we have voted in favour, even though our views differ markedly from some of those expressed by the rapporteur.
We trust the communication will be favourably received at the Laeken Council.
We regret that some right-wing Members have referred to terrorism and immigration in the same breath during the debate. This gives rise to mistrust of immigrants and Muslim refugees.
Evans report (A5-0304/2001) and Pirker report (A5-0305/2001)
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mr Evans' s and Mr Pirker' s reports.
We agree that, in the longer term, the EU should develop a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for persons granted asylum.
Moreover, the EU' s immigration policy should be adapted to developments in the world.
We are nonetheless alert to the fact that the communications relate to an area covered by Title IV of the Treaty Establishing the European Community and do not apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark' s position.
- (FR) We voted in favour of the Evans report because it contains a certain amount of progress as regards the position of refugees and because it ought to go without saying that on this subject all the countries of the Union should apply the same procedure.
However, this joint situation should be in line with the country that is most favourable to refugees, which is far from being the case.
Moreover, the wording leaves several loopholes for those Member States who like the rules to be applied more restrictively, which limits the actual scope of measures which are a step in the right direction.
On the other hand, we voted against the Pirker report on immigration, which justifies a policy of immigration quotas based solely on the interests of the bosses in the countries concerned.
This report tries to provide a legal basis for the activities of traffickers in modern slaves, allowing them to seek the workers that they need in poor countries, and giving them the right to turn people away as soon as there is no longer a demand for them.
Titley report (A5-0309/2001)
. (EL) The terrorist attack on the USA gives us an incentive to look at the problem of arms exports in a new light.
Having said which, the Titley report, despite containing a number of positive, albeit general, pointers, does not I think, come anywhere near to responding to the demands of the times.
It is unacceptable for the European Union to base its code of conduct in arms exports on the criterion of the 'needs of the European defence industry' , because this negates any substantive measures which might be mentioned.
The European Union should move to get the USA, Russia, China and all the other major arms exporters to adopt binding rules of conduct and their unwillingness should not be a reason for the European Union to relax or otherwise fail to act properly.
At the same time, we need an observatory at European level, we need records and transparency on arms exports so that we can put an immediate end to the scandalous practice of selling arms to forces of crime and destabilisation which have no hesitation in using terrorism to turn their arms against the European Union and its citizens.
This is why I feel that the motion falls short and I did not vote for it.
- (DA) The idea of regulating politically the production and export of arms has our complete backing, but we reject Mr Titley' s report with the following justification.
The report does not reflect the fundamental conflict between the interests of the arms industry and an ideal and peaceful world order.
To introduce a report on codes of conduct on arms exports by, in paragraph 1 d), proclaiming that the EU' s policy on arms exports should 'meet the needs and challenges of the European defence industry' is self-contradictory.
In the same way, we are opposed to the goal of making arms exports policy into a tool for developing a common defence policy, as intimated in paragraph 1 e).
We acknowledge that positive changes have been made and also support a number of the individual wordings.
. The Verts/ALE Group welcomes the fact that the report by Mr Titley on an EU code of conduct on arms exports is a major improvement on his previous reports on this issue.
We can fully support the vast majority of this report and we welcome many of its recommendations.
However we regret that many of our members felt they had to abstain from the final vote because the amendment to delete section 1 (d) "... Reiterates its belief that European policy in arms export must: (d) meet the needs and challenges of the European defence industry" was not adopted.
Had this section been removed we could have supported the final report.
But to leave this objective in the report completely contradicts what we believe to be an ethical policy on arms.
We feel that an ethical code of conduct on arms exports should not be dictated by the needs of the European defence industry.
. (NL) The sale of instruments which facilitate the killing of people can be very lucrative.
Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September in America, the profit expectations of the arms industry have risen.
The only possible justification for producing weapons is in self-defence against external enemies who aim to take over, suppress us or wipe us out.
The production of arms as an economic activity, to make profit by means of exporting to regions where people want to buy those weapons, means that money is considered more important than human life.
Against the wishes of Parliament, last year, the Council pressed ahead with lifting the arms embargo against Indonesia, despite the violence in East Timor, the Moluccas, Aceh and West Papua.
Mr Titley' s proposal contains only a non-legislative reference, but includes a number of improvements on the current situation, such as the legal enforcement of the Code of Conduct for arms exports, and its application to candidate countries.
He is right to request that permission from the Member States be required by European companies to transfer licences for the production of military equipment outside of European territory.
I support him in his aims of a worldwide agreement, annual reports on the application of the Code of Conduct and a refusal to allow the supply of weapons to countries that do not provide information to the UN conventional weapons register.
Langenhagen report (A5-0288/2001)
- (FR) The GALILEO Programme is being presented to us as enabling progress to be made in various fields (the management of land, air and sea transport, road traffic, the organisation of life-saving at sea) thanks to radio-navigation by satellite.
We are told that GALILEO testifies to a desire to ensure the independence of Europe from the United States which, with its Global Positioning System (GPS), has launched a similar programme.
In fact, what it really does is provide an enormous market for European businesses, in other words a new source of profits for their owners and shareholders.
For it is they who will be the primary beneficiaries of GALILEO - indeed they already are - whether in the telecommunications sector, the transport sector or the space sector, since GALILEO involves the launching of a network of thirty satellites.
Public funding amounting to almost EUR 2 billion has already been budgeted for and to some extent released by the European Union and the European Space Agency.
As for private investors, they are reluctant to pay a single penny. Yet the European Union is not planning to call for their financial involvement until the final phase of the project, after it has been launched and guaranteed by public money.
According to the reporter, however, the private investors who have been promised responsibility for managing GALILEO and therefore 'possible revenue flows from GALILEO services' , are unwilling to take any 'economic risk' .
They are waiting for a 'positive signal from the political side' of Europe. In other words they are waiting to be told that the political side will take on responsibility for all the costs, leaving the investors with nothing to do but collect the profits.
Though the European authorities are revelling in the supposed virtues of private initiative, the capitalists, for their part, want paying with more than words. They want guaranteed profits, without any risk, and they know that they can count on both European and national authorities to give them what they want.
We have therefore voted against this report.
- (FR) I am pleased to be able to express my opinion of the GALILEO project at a time when the events of 11 September are forcing us to review our capacity to handle crises.
Remember that the GALILEO project is intended to deploy a set of satellites orbiting about 20 000 km above the Earth. All those satellites would be linked to a network of control stations on the ground.
Cover would thus be worldwide, making it possible to improve considerably the management of air, sea and road traffic and to support search and rescue operations.
This technology already exists in the USA (the GPS system) and in Russia (the GLONASS system).
It is currently financed and controlled by the military authorities in those two countries.
The quality and continuity of its use for civilian purposes are dependent on those authorities who may, at any time, discontinue or downgrade the signal.
In Europe, on the other hand, the GALILEO programme will be managed and controlled by civilians.
It is proposed that the system should be developed in four stages, namely a definition phase in 2000, a development and validation phase up to 2005, a deployment phase up to 2007 and an operational phase after that.
Ideally then, the GALILEO system should be operational from 2008 onwards, thereby responding to the wishes expressed at the European Council in Stockholm and to the European Union' s urgent needs in this field.
This, at any rate, is what emerges from the report by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
On the question of financing, it seems to me to be important to clear up the question of how this will be organised before coming to a final decision.
I also deplore the fact that some Member States are reluctant to lend their support to this project.
I therefore invite the Commission to take the necessary steps to break down this reluctance.
It will then have the task of defining a general financing structure, and that will have to be done between now and 15 November 2001 if we want to be reasonably sure of meeting the 2008 deadline.
The European Parliament will have to be consulted on the Commission' s draft.
Once this draft has been approved, it should be possible to encourage the involvement of European industry in the financing of the later stages in the medium and long term.
- (FR) First of all I should like to thank both our rapporteur from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mrs Brigitte Langenhagen, and also the whole of that Committee, for the high-quality work that they have submitted to us and also for the fact that they have strongly emphasised both the advantages and the difficulties that could result from the implementation of the GALILEO satellite navigation programme.
Let us remember, briefly, that the GALILEO satellite navigation programme is an ambitious project which provides for the deployment of an arrangement of satellites in orbit at a distance of about 20 000 km from the Earth, linked to a network of ground control stations.
This definition shows us how important it is to vote in favour of this report, as I shall be doing. The implementation of the GALILEO project will enable us to have world coverage which can be used not only for controlling air, sea and road traffic but also for supporting search and rescue operations.
However, although it is necessary, for the above-mentioned reasons, to vote in favour of the report, thereby allowing the EU to develop a system which the European Council in Stockholm considered was important enough to be launched 'without delay' , we should do so while bearing in mind those areas - highlighted in the report - which may prove to be problematical in future.
It is, in fact, extremely important that we should remain vigilant regarding the possibility of such a system being used for military purposes. It is possible that the system might be misused, and it is up to us to be aware of this and to ensure that such a thing cannot happen.
In addition, it should be noted that the immediate funding of such a project will not be without its problems.
Member States, or at least some of them, are reluctant to lend their financial support to the implementation of GALILEO, and private investors do not seem to be particularly enthusiastic about the idea of participating in such a project either.
In other words, before coming to a final decision, the budgetary authorities of the European Union need to have an accurate understanding of the financing involved, which means that the Commission will have to prepare proposals for the management structures for the GALILEO project.
(Speech shortened under Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
. (PT) Our vote expresses the conviction that it is worthwhile having a European project that functions properly and is independent of military and defence activities, including that of third countries, which is not the case at present, given Europe' s dependence in this context on the United States of America.
It is crucial, however, that the implementation of the project respects citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees, namely their privacy.
Its creation may be an advantage for the mobile telecommunications services, which can use it for localisation applications requested by users if the financial cost does not render such use prohibitive.
It is also necessary to take the cost of financing it into account, especially the share that may be demanded of countries that do not participate directly in its creation, in order not to hinder its implementation in the various Member States.
.
(NL) GALILEO will not come into being until American competition has cornered the European market, which will be too late.
Such a navigation system by satellite might have become part of a strategy to make Europe less reliant on the US.
There are plenty of reasons for this. America is threatening us with increased global warming, again with an anti-missile shield dating from the 'Star Wars' period, with meat containing hormones, noisy aircraft, the ECHELON tapping system, a monopoly of patents and with a dollar which, as international currency, has for decades passed on the deficits of the American balance of payments to the outside world.
At the moment, it is even threatening to drag us into a war against the third world.
Restricted access of American products manufactured under poor working and environmental conditions to the European market might force America to pay more attention to labour, the environment, public health, animal torture, human rights and peace.
Only in a confrontation of that kind could we possibly have a need for GALILEO.
As long as such a confrontation is not forthcoming, the GALILEO project remains a contribution of the European taxpayer to industry in the field of electronics and space travel, and that industry is largely subject to military interests.
It would be preferable to spend the money for GALILEO on environmental care and useful collective facilities.
Rübig report (A5-0234/2001)
- (FR) Deploring the fact that the European Union is lagging behind the United States and Japan, the report proposes a series of measures claiming to encourage 'innovation promotion and progress in research' .
All the proposed measures are centred on the idea that it is the task of the public authorities to finance the research, directly or indirectly, but that it is private interests who will profit from it.
This ranges from subsidies to what the report calls 'innovative enterprises' to measures to encourage 'synergy between businesses and universities' , which means that as far as research is concerned the latter will be subordinate to the former.
In its explanatory statement, the report not only preaches the promotion of 'entrepreneurship at the educational level' but also says that 'obstacles to mobility arising from social security systems should be removed' .
The title of the report is 'Innovation in a knowledge-driven economy' .
It would be more accurate to talk about the subordination of knowledge, research and public money to the interests of the bosses in a profit-driven economy.
Since we are opposed to both the spirit and the letter of this report, we have voted against it.
- (FR) The reception given to this Commission Communication on 'Innovation in a knowledge-driven economy' has been largely positive.
It sets out the European scoreboard for innovation, drawn up on the basis of statistics available at European level.
An analysis shows that despite the efforts made by Member States to promote innovation, Europe' s performance is still trailing behind that of its main competitors. Yet innovation was one of the strategic priorities identified by the European Council in Lisbon in March 2000.
Consequently, the Commission makes several recommendations to Member States with a view to improving their policies on encouraging innovative enterprises and support for innovation throughout the whole of the economic and social fabric.
The Member States are invited to improve their policies on encouraging innovative enterprises, removing obstacles to initiatives and innovators, encouraging private investment in research and innovation, and improving the rules governing the use of the results obtained by publicly funded research.
Naturally I support these proposals.
I believe that the projects that are covered by this philosophy will be able to obtain funds as part of the Sixth FRDP.
The rapporteur has identified three key sectors in which Community intervention and Member States' commitment are necessary. These are the creation of entrepreneurship at the educational level, the promotion of the training of workers, and the promotion of innovation among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
He also emphasises the need to take into consideration the needs of the SMEs, since they represent 60 million undertakings and 60% of jobs in the European Union.
Innovation cannot exist without the SMEs.
I agree with him there, of course, but I have to admit that we have been hearing the same speeches for years, all about the essential role of the SMEs in the European economy and the need to remove the many obstacles to their development.
Alas, little progress has been achieved.
I took this into account when I drafted my report on the Sixth FRDP, and as far as possible I tried to guarantee the SMEs access to European research and development funding.
. Madam President, I warmly welcome my colleague Paul Rubig's report which promotes research and innovation and backs a Commission initiative to promote innovation.
Time and again the EU has been criticised for failing to keep abreast of technological innovation and is sorely lagging behind its American counterparts in this field.
The EU should do more to exploit its potential to innovate in this field and this was recognised, as the report outlines, in the Lisbon, so-called, dot.com Summit.
European Member States need to collude and pool their separate specialisms and create a system of 'benchmarking'.
To supplement these measures the report rightly calls for more high quality education.
This will do much to boost the EU's Lisbon Strategy.
Lastly, these innovations cannot progress unless there is a loosening of bureaucratic regulations.
If we decrease the amount of red tape which currently hinders European innovation, then we will go some way in becoming more able to compete with America.
This will promote more start-ups and new ventures.
Mayer report (A5-0311/2001)
- (FR) Yesterday evening, at the end of the debate, and quoting various studies in support of his argument, Commissioner Balkestein clearly contradicted those who claim that prices have risen since the introduction of the Community exhaustion system.
On the contrary, he maintained, prices have even fallen in some cases.
Those who claim to defend consumers are in fact protecting parallel import circuits which threaten quality, innovation and employment and encourage counterfeiting.
Hence the three amendments which I tabled, and which seem to be worrying the rapporteur.
In effect, the PPE-DE called for a roll-call vote on all our amendments so as to ensure, right to the end, the control of its members and the commitment of certain coordinators.
I am afraid that, yet again, pressure and bargaining will carry the day and that a bad decision will be taken.
In order to avoid any useless multiplication of the costs represented by these requests for roll-call votes, we withdraw our first two amendments and retain only Amendment No 3, which we believe is enough to demonstrate the sad reality of the situation.
That the international exhaustion of rights conferred by trade marks has been an energetically discussed topic in recent months, is shown by this report, which has dragged on for months and has been thoroughly revised, as is clear from a comparison with the first draft report.
The exhaustion of trade mark rights affects all branded products.
As President of the Wine Intergroup, I would like to concentrate on the consequences for this sector.
The international exhaustion of trade mark rights will be of no advantage to the consumer in the European Union as regards food and drink, as is confirmed by the study produced by National Economic Research Associates (NERA) at the Commission's request.
European consumers could indeed be put at a disadvantage in the longer term by our industries' losing the opportunity to develop new products and to offer the consumer new services.
Should yields decrease decisively through parallel imports from third countries, there will also be a decline in motivation to invest in new markets.
In the event of the international trade mark rights becoming exhausted, complex distribution networks will come into being and it will become more difficult to put a stop to trade mark piracy.
There is no doubt that disadvantages will result for the consumer and for the manufacturer of branded goods, for example with regard to consumer health protection.
I am therefore speaking out against the international exhaustion of trade mark rights.
However, in view of events since the report was drafted, I will not be voting against it.
Joint resolution on racism (RC B5-0605/2001)
.
The UK Conservatives voted against this motion for resolution since it repeats the errors of the Durban conference.
We cannot support the undue emphasis on the Middle East, and are not convinced that it might not have been better had the conference failed to reach a conclusion.
In many respects, the Durban conference belongs to an age that came to an end on 11 September.
There are three reasons underlying any racist behaviour: firstly, ignorance about the other person, which may lead to fear and thus rejection; secondly, the bad faith and arrogance of those who want to feel superior, maybe subconsciously prompted by an inferiority complex; and thirdly, the political, economic or religious ambition of those who want to acquire as much power as they can by dominating other people.
Therefore, while it is clear that large-scale, incisive cultural measures need to be taken to teach all people respect for others and acceptance, it is equally clear that civil society must use every tool available to it to fight those political, cultural, economic and religious systems which breed and are based on racism.
Respect for diversities must include, however, constant, enlightened action on the part of civil society so that the objective of respect for human rights and dignity is achieved throughout the world.
Therefore, the behaviour of those civilised Western - and other - cultures which are fighting against religious or ritualistic practices, for example, which physically or psychologically damage a person, cannot be considered to be racist.
In being subjected to these practices, women continue to be treated not as human beings entitled to exercise all rights but as objects subject to customs which prevent or limit their participation in society and politics.
The entire history of mankind has, I am sad to say, been marked by collective and individual racist behaviour.
In condemning the racism of the past, the political world must avoid falling into the trap of fresh racist behaviour now.
Indeed, we cannot disregard the fact that there is a form of political racism currently in existence: the racism indulged in by those who condemn the ideas of others merely because they are the expression of a different political hue.
That is why we call upon Parliament, the Commission and the Council to take much more effective action both within and outside the Community than they have done thus far, to promote a culture of mutual respect among people and governments, which, if it is to be genuine, must not tolerate attitudes, ideas or behaviour which fail to respect human dignity, whether they are based on religious, cultural, economic or political ideals.
For these reasons, I voted for the resolution.
- (FR) The MPF Members abstained from the vote on the resolution on the Durban Conference as a sign of their very strong disapproval of the highly ambiguous conduct observed in this House by European Union representatives.
In fact, here we have a conference convened under the aegis of the United Nations allowing itself to be overrun and exploited by a grouping of Islamist NGOs, with the active or benevolent complicity of a significant number of states, mainly in the Arab-Muslim world, some of which are usually described as 'moderates', a conference that goes so far as to suggest an untenable equation of Zionism with racism, while our representatives go on sitting there as though nothing had happened.
In face of the attitude of the United States and Israel, whose departure from the conference was a sign that the threshold of the unacceptable had been crossed, the European Union, by remaining, and however much it denies this today, ran the risk of appearing to support these shameful equations and intolerable excesses that the philosopher Alain Finkielkraut summarised as follows: 'In Durban, anti-racism has taken over anti-Semitism and the denial of humanity'.
The Europeans should have left for the sake of their honour and dignity, which would have sent out a strong and salutary signal to the UN and its General Secretariat and encouraged them to take a firm stance in face of the attempt by Islamism to impose its ideological influence, and genuinely to represent the interests and values of the international community. Any show of complaisance towards the kind of equations proposed in Durban can indeed be interpreted as a sign of weakness on our part and of encouragement towards those who have set themselves the objective of destroying our values.
. I voted against the resolution in relation to the World Conference against Racism in Durban to make it clear that this conference has done the gravest possible disservice to the promotion of good race relations.
The conference was hijacked by those whose sole objective was to attack the state of Israel and to ignore the fact that it is the one nation in the Middle East based on democracy.
Israel was singled out by countries and organisations which have an appalling record on human rights.
Even worse the language and the tone of the attacks had more in common with 'Der Stürmer' in the Germany of Adolf Hitler.
And yet despite this no condemnation of the United Nations or the conference for allowing this to happen.
The United States made it clear that it would take no part in these proceedings.
The European Union should have taken a similar view.
That it failed to do so was a sad reflection on its failure to learn the lessons of history.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.39 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Welcome
Ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to say what a pleasure it is for the presidency to welcome the delegation from the Moroccan Parliament to this House. This delegation is led by Mr Brahim Rachidi, who is visiting us for the ninth time.
In welcoming Mr Rachidi and the members of his delegation, I would like to highlight the importance we attach to such meetings. They provide an opportunity for both Parliaments to reaffirm their common commitment to the fundamental principles of democracy.
As you are aware ladies and gentlemen, Morocco has joined with us in condemning the recent criminal attacks on the United States. In addition, Morocco has expressed its solidarity with the United States and all freedom-loving countries in no uncertain terms.
Morocco has also made its commitment to the global fight against terrorism quite clear.
Along with its southern Mediterranean neighbours, the European Union is intent on playing its part in the building of a stable, strong and democratic region within the framework of the Barcelona process. This process is essential to the future of Europe and of its nearest and dearest neighbours.
We are facing difficult times. I should like to emphasise, Mr Vice-President of the Moroccan Parliament, that we shall maintain our commitment to these common values throughout.
We shall also maintain our strong opposition to any attempt to identify terrorism with the Arab-Muslim world. In this connection, we have committed ourselves to act resolutely and nip in the bud any consequences for nationalism, racism or xenophobia.
Mr Vice-President, it is my earnest hope that the conversations you are to have with the members of the Delegation for relations with the countries of the Maghreb and with other colleagues will serve to strengthen existing links between European Union countries and the Kingdom of Morocco. I hope too that these contacts will help us to continue making progress in our common quest for peace and prosperity for all countries bordering the Mediterranean.
(Applause)
Growth and Stability Pact - Informal ECOFIN of 22/23 September in Liege
The next item is statements by the Council and the Commission on the Growth and Stability Pact, and also on the informal meeting of ECOFIN ministers in Liege on 22 and 23 September.
I shall give the floor first to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, who will speak on behalf of the Council.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too have great pleasure in welcoming a delegation from the Moroccan Parliament to the gallery.
It so happened that my duties had taken me to Casablanca when the tragic events of 11 September took place. I was leading a Belgian economic mission to Morocco.
I was at lunch with ten members of the Moroccan government, including the Prime Minister of Morocco, and we heard the tragic news together.
Together we shared the distress caused by these horrific events, and the subsequent reactions you are aware of.
I too would therefore like to welcome the delegation which is here with us today.
(NL) As far back as the introduction of the single currency, it was decided to bring about reinforced, economic coordination among the then eleven, and now twelve, Member States belonging to the eurozone.
This coordination materialised via the Eurogroup which Belgium is chairing throughout this year and in which finance ministers of the Member States which have adopted the euro are represented, together with the European Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary matters, as well as the President of the European Central Bank.
As you know, this reinforced coordination has an informal and structural dimension and does not prejudice the responsibilities assigned to the ECOFIN Council by the Treaties.
For the first few years when the single currency came into being - and I am talking about 1999 and 2000 - the bulk of the activities were aimed at the development of, and familiarisation with, this reinforced economic coordination among the Member States taking part in the eurozone.
Pursuant to, and with due respect to, the subsidiarity principle, this coordination faces the most important challenge of marrying the practice of economic authorities of each individual Member State involved, with the common monetary project to which these Member States have subscribed.
It is the task of the European Central Bank to adopt an independent monetary policy, the key objective of which is to maintain price stability.
The decentralisation of the economic policy and the centralisation of monetary decisions are, as it were, a basic contradiction in terms within the Economic and Monetary Union.
The Eurogroup' s first task in this reinforced, economic coordination, is to outline the mainstays of the eurozone' s economic policy.
In fact, the message which was formulated in Nice last year by the Heads of State and Government is very much along the same lines.
In its conclusions, the European Council is delighted at both the improved operation of the Eurogroup and the reinforced coordination of the economic policy of the Member States in the eurozone.
All efforts by the Belgian Presidency of the Eurogroup are channelled into reinforcing the role, the visibility and the credibility of the Eurogroup.
In addition, the Belgian Presidency is also drafting a reference framework and the working method for the coming years, especially in connection with the coordination of the economic policy of the different Member States.
The key instruments of a macro-economic policy, especially the monetary and budgetary policy, must be combined in an optimal policy mix, as it were, to achieve the pre-supposed objectives, such as promoting price stability and bolstering economic activity.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the interests of the Eurogroup it is important firstly to develop an effective and lasting budgetary policy for the entire area, and also specifically for each of the Member States.
This must be done in line with national constraints and special considerations.
This budgetary policy must dovetail with the monetary policy of the European Central Bank.
However, it will not be easy to finalise the details of this type of budgetary policy for several reasons. Firstly, the results of any budgetary policy depend on the time scales established.
For example, in the short term, pro-cyclical budgetary policies should not be used.
In the medium term, the objectives of the Growth and Stability Pact to establish a balance or surplus of public finances should be maintained.
In the long term, it will be essential to ensure the viability of public finances. This should take account of the different elements involved, including the difficult and important problem of the ageing of populations.
Ladies and gentlemen, what I have just said clearly demonstrates the extent of the challenges before us. Do I really have to highlight just how difficulties with planning and methods, and the inevitable economic uncertainty, make it very difficult and complicated to define and implement budgetary policies?
We are confronted by statistical problems, the uncertainty surrounding economic forecasts, even in the short term, and the diversity of the many situations. There is also the fact that the effects of budgetary policies are only felt after a certain period of time.
All this makes it difficult to determine a budgetary policy ex ante.
The long-term analysis of budgetary policy is also an essential part of structural policies. The strategy combines a number of approaches as regards the ageing of our populations.
The strategy aims to step up the reduction of public debt. It also promotes the adoption of measures to increase employment levels.
This involves the gradual elimination of obstacles to employment, particularly by reducing the fiscal burden on employment. Lastly, the strategy provides for the in-depth reform of pensions systems, in order to ensure their viability.
The Belgian Presidency is seeking to examine public finances in greater depth on an ongoing and long-term basis. Particular attention will be paid to examining public finances in relation to the stability and convergence programme.
Member States and the other interested parties agree on the long-term objectives and the instruments to be used.
However, as regards the short and medium term, recent economic deterioration has created some confusion.
Clearly, we need to hold an in-depth debate on this matter in order to define and establish a strong common position.
We must hold such a debate during our presidency.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must keep to the terms of the Growth and Stability Pact.
Member States stated this commitment during the informal meeting of ECOFIN at Liège on 21 and 22 September.
Therefore, there can be no question of Member States being faced with deficits in excess of the convergence criteria of 3%.
The Extraordinary European Council of 21 September also reaffirmed its commitment to the framework, regulations and full implementation of the Growth and Stability Pact.
However, budgetary balances do not necessarily have to be set in stone.
Instead of a purely nominal approach, there should be the ability to make adjustments in relation to changes in economic circumstances.
The broad guidelines of economic policy for 2001, adopted at Gothenburg last June, are very clear on this point. The principle is accepted without discussion in a favourable economic climate.
Hence, better than expected economic growth inevitably leads to a greater improvement in nominal budgetary figures. For this reason also, a pro-cyclical budgetary policy, together with a decrease in spending which could lead to overheating, is not permitted.
The question that now arises is to establish whether this allowance for cyclical variation can be implemented in a similar way in periods of poor growth or recession.
The Belgian Presidency is convinced that this is indeed possible. The broad guidelines of economic policy for 2001 confirm our belief.
In a less favourable economic climate, the balances already taken into consideration within the framework of the Pact, should also be adjusted in line with changed economic circumstances.
Nominal balances can therefore be affected by worsening economic conditions. However, they can only fluctuate according to those same economic conditions.
In these circumstances, a pro-cyclical policy should not be used.
Consequently, a decrease in revenue should not be then compensated for by an equivalent reduction in spending.
Cyclical adjustments must be reliable in order to assess the budgetary positions correctly.
The agenda of the Belgian Presidency therefore allows some time for us to refine effective methods to calculate the disparity between production and potential growth. These methods should be used in future stability programmes.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all these issues will doubtless lead to some long but interesting discussions at the next meeting of the euro area.
Mr President, I, too, would like to offer a warm welcome to the Moroccan delegation with us today. I shall also endeavour to analyse two issues confronting us, namely the Growth and Stability Pact and the informal ECOFIN Council and shall attempt to report on both during my first speech.
The Liege Council on 22 and 23 September 2001 focused on the economic impact of the terrorist attacks on the United States.
I should like to refer to three aspects of this impact discussed at ECOFIN. Firstly, the economic situation.
The opportunity was also taken to discuss the Growth and Stability Pact.
Secondly, the financing of terrorism.
Thirdly, the problems airlines are experiencing with regard to insurance.
I shall also comment on two other important matters raised at Liege, namely preparations for transition to the euro and issues related to globalisation.
Concerning the first point, I should emphasise that the attacks on the United States have strengthened our conviction that international cooperation on financial and political issues is essential. Further, coordination of economic policies within the European Union must be strengthened.
As from last year, the slowdown of economic activity in the United States and the rest of the world has been having a greater impact on the European Union than was originally anticipated.
The tragic events in the United States have increased uncertainty and the negative risks for anticipated general growth.
We cannot act as if nothing had happened, but at the same time it is very difficult to produce an accurate estimate of the potential impact of those acts.
Within the European Union, growth will be well below 2% this year. We are however still hoping for a gradual recovery of internal demand in the coming quarters.
There are a number of reasons for this: lower inflation, recent tax reductions and more favourable monetary conditions.
The risks should therefore be manageable. We must, of course, monitor economic changes very closely so as to adjust economic policies as necessary, both in the Union and in each of the Member States.
Following the events on 11 September, political leaders showed their determination to act swiftly and appropriately to eliminate the risks of a lengthier slowdown. To this end, we must also maintain our medium-term objectives, and move through our agenda more swiftly.
I have in mind in particular the Lisbon agenda.
We need to modernise our economies quickly so we can reverse the slowdown as soon as possible and increase our capacity for growth.
As I stated earlier, the declaration following the informal ECOFIN confirmed the commitment of Member States to the framework, rules and implementation of the Growth and Stability Pact.
As the presidency has pointed out, slower growth will affect the nominal value of budgetary positions. Departure from the objectives ought, however, to be limited.
The Growth and Stability Pact is a suitable framework for budgetary policy in times when the economy is developing well and in less good times.
It makes it possible to implement the most appropriate budgetary policy for each set of circumstances.
It is possible to resort to all the possibilities provided in the pact.
The automatic stabilisers will be more effective if the slowdown is greater than anticipated.
The manner and extent to which these stabilisers operate will depend on the situation of each Member State. Those states closer to balancing their budget will obviously have more room for manoeuvre.
Current budgetary situations result from compliance with existing budgetary rules, and have enabled the European Central Bank to adopt a flexible monetary policy. In particular, they have made it possible for the Bank to take the right decision quickly and reduce interest rates by fifty basic points on 17 September.
An increase in deficits over and above what can be justified by the operation of the stabilisers would reduce the options open to the Central Bank as regards possible future cuts in rates of interest.
The European Council requested the Commission to submit a study of the likely evolution of the economic situation together with the recommendations it envisages to the forthcoming European Council at Ghent.
The report will have to be viewed as an ongoing systematic exercise allowing for adjustment of the assessment of the evolution of risks and the possible consequences.
My second comment concerns action to combat the financing of terrorism. The ECOFIN statement gives prominence to a number of specific actions.
Firstly, the matter of the review of the directive on money laundering. This is currently under negotiation, as you are aware.
I should like to emphasise once again, on behalf of the Commission and in line with the ECOFIN statement at Liege, that we attach great political significance to the swift conclusion of this process.
It will send out a clear signal of the Union' s commitment to stamping out criminal activity supported by money laundering.
I should also like to highlight the Commission' s approval of the draft regulation on specific measures to freeze the assets of individuals or entities involved in the financing of terrorist activities. We hope the Council and Parliament will deal with this as a matter of urgency so that it can be implemented immediately.
It gives a clear indication of our political determination to grant no respite to those who attack political coexistence and the freedoms of all citizens.
The ECOFIN Council also agreed general guidelines on government intervention concerning the insurance problems facing airline companies.
The ECOFIN statement invites the Commission to broaden the remit of the ad hoc group set up in the framework of the Transport Council to include insurance problems.
The statement also specifies that the Commission must be notified of any measure taken by governments, including financial amounts.
This will enable the Commission to discharge its responsibility of ensuring that such measures are compatible with Community legislation and to ensure consistency between the responses by the various Member States.
The Commission is drafting a report on the impact of the attacks on 11 September on the air transport industry.
There was also an opportunity at the informal ECOFIN to pursue the discussion on preparations for the introduction of the euro. Such discussions have been held at regular intervals.
The Commission is drafting a report on the subject for the forthcoming European Council at Ghent on 19 October.
At Liege I appealed to the Member States to pay particular attention to three aspects which seem to me crucial at this juncture. Firstly, the problem of supplying small traders in advance.
They need to be informed and convinced of the commercial advantages of advance supply.
It is also important however to find ways of helping them to work with the banks. The latter should offer fair debit conditions for the amounts in euro received by small traders before 31 December 2001.
In addition, it is essential to provide specific training for small traders and for all those working on the tills in any kind of business.
The third issue causing us concern is monitoring of the prices of goods and services over the period of the changeover to the euro.
We cannot go through the process of calculating the harmonised consumer price index every week, nor would it make sense to do so. Nonetheless, we can however provide the citizens with information on the evolution of certain key prices in a transparent manner.
As this exercise is to be undertaken by government agencies, transparency and objectivity will be guaranteed, and the sample chosen will be appropriate.
The informal ECOFIN also agreed with the Commission' s proposal to establish a common European network to organise exchange of information during the period when notes and coins are to be introduced.
This network will start to operate at the beginning of December in close cooperation with the European Central Bank' s Cash Changeover Committee.
The last issue I would like to deal with is the debate on globalisation.
The Commission has followed the public debate on globalisation closely, including the debate on the so-called Tobin levy or tax.
We have taken note of ECOFINs interest in receiving a report on these issues.
This debate focuses on two clearly relevant objectives on which we share the concerns expressed by many of the participants in the debate on globalisation.
Firstly, to avoid excessive fluctuation in the rates of interest which could prevent the hoped-for economic development of developing countries. Secondly, to find sources of additional finance to combat poverty.
There is no single instrument allowing us to attain both these objectives at once.
The Union and other countries, international institutions and other groups have developed a range of instruments and policies in an attempt to work towards these objectives.
More and better action could of course be taken, and the Commission is prepared to explore new possibilities.
As originally defined, Professor Tobin' s idea of imposing a tax on foreign currency transactions was intended to put a damper on international monetary markets.
It was put forward as a second best solution to put the brakes on short-term speculative movements.
The Commission has already made its point of view clear on a number of occasions.
A tax on monetary transactions is not an effective way of dealing with the problems arising from excessive volatility of financial flows or with inequalities between countries.
A wide range of instruments should be drawn upon. The Tobin levy or tax is not the magic wand allowing us to deal with all the challenges which have arisen.
We need to consider a wide range of instruments in our efforts to attain financial and monetary stability.
A global approach to the financial edifice is called for, both at internal European Union level and at international level. This should include regulatory frameworks, institutions and the problem of money laundering.
A wide-ranging approach to the financing of development is also required.
Different instruments can be used to deal with poverty, debt reduction, the supply of international public goods and the protection of the environment.
The Commission is prepared to make an active contribution to the debate on the instruments to ensure coherence between globalisation, sustainable development and world governance. I am sure we can also count on support from Parliament and the Council.
These issues are of course beyond the Union' s strict sphere of competence. We should tackle them together with other countries and institutions.
The Commission is ready to respond to the Council' s invitation to continue working on how best to respond to the key objectives I referred to. In any case, part of this work is already under way within the Commission.
We are currently preparing a report on the external dimension of sustainable development. This is due next January and is aimed at the Río+10 conference to be held in Johannesburg next year.
Ladies and gentlemen, these are the key issues I wanted to share with you.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why did my group demand this afternoon's debate on the Stability and Growth Pact?
The reason given was that we were disturbed by certain utterances we have heard emanating from the ranks of socialist governments in the past weeks and months.
The statements made by Mr Eichel, Mr Jospin, Mr Fabius, and other things that were said, all went along the same lines.
For a start, they asserted that it was necessary in the present situation to soften the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.
That was the first demand.
The second was that the Heads of State and of Government must be accorded the right to prescribe annual stability objectives to the European Central Bank.
We take the view that both these proposals are extraordinarily dangerous, for the Stability and Growth Pact and the independence of the European Central Bank are the twin pillars on which rests the European Union's monetary system.
These pillars must not be shaken.
My group will always speak up in favour of maintaining the independent European Central Bank and the Stability and Growth Pact in their present forms.
Let us turn now to the resolutions on the table before us.
Jointly with the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party, we have submitted a motion for a resolution.
We negotiated with the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which stated that it was unable to agree to our resolution.
What, though, is so bad about our resolution?
It states that the Stability and Growth Pact should, in quite simple words, be 'retained'.
Why can they not agree to that?
Then they said: We want to put its principles fully into practice.
Why not just agree to it then?
We need measures against money laundering.
You spoke about that, Commissioner.
We need measures to destroy the financial background for terrorist acts.
Why not agree to that?
We must also be consistent in reducing monopolies in order to strengthen the competitiveness of our European economy.
Why can they not agree to that?
Now for the second question: what counter-proposal does the other side have to offer?
They put forward essentially the same ones over and over again: that the European Central Bank should cut interest rates.
Or, on the other hand, that the Stability and Growth Pact, or the Member States' budget policies, should be relaxed.
That is the Socialist policy mix.
That is the potion concocted by druids to cure all the ills of our economy at a stroke and without effort.
It would be nice if things worked like that, my dear Christa!
But in reality they do not.
Take a look at Japan, where this policy was applied and where it does not work.
Consider the stock exchanges in the United States today, where it can be seen that it does not work.
Look at economic history, where we see from the past that it has never yet worked.
So I would like to urge you to reject these demands and support our resolution.
Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of the grave global situation, I have no desire to enter into a puerile argument with my fellow Member, Mr von Wogau.
Mr von Wogau has just accused the Socialist Group of having the worst of intentions.
This is certainly not the policy we are defending here.
We must bear in mind that the attacks of 11 September have not only caused great human suffering. They may also have far-reaching consequences for civil liberties and for the global economy.
Before 11 September, the United States was clearly already experiencing a slowdown and Japan was already in a bad way. However, before 11 September a slowdown was already evident in Europe.
It had proved necessary to revise some forecasts downwards. Furthermore, it is clear that the situation in Europe and worldwide will be worse during the third quarter than it was during the second quarter.
What we need to do now is prevent a recession.
As we are all aware, a recession is defined as negative growth for two consecutive six-month periods.
According to Mr von Wogau, we must now wait six months to see if we are really in a recession. However, I believe that we must respond by pursuing a pragmatic policy.
I think that Europe owes it to herself to respond to this threat of a recessionary spiral with a proactive economic policy.
This should be achieved within the European Union by improving the coordination of economic policies.
The Council representative said just this to the House. The European Union should also increase political cooperation with all its economic partners, including developing countries.
We would like to establish a pragmatic policy like that of the United States, although, as far as I know, the United States does not have a Socialist government...
We should of course take account of the Growth and Stability Pact. We should not encourage Member States to exceed budgetary deficit limits, especially the 3% threshold.
Nevertheless, as the Council representative has said, we must assess the long-term viability of public finances. The Growth and Stability Pact states that public finances should be balanced, or almost balanced.
We must also respond in the short term.
Economic stabilisers can have a role to play.
We are experiencing the consequences of a negative external event. The Growth and Stability Pact allows for us to respond to negative external events.
I do not wish to engage in ideological debate.
Mr von Wogau' s interpretation of the Growth and Stability Pact is merely theological. We are not calling for state aid.
Nor are we calling for quick-fix solutions. We are calling for selective measures to support sectors badly affected by the current economic situation.
Ladies and gentlemen, lastly, I would like to stress that we are not facing a war between different civilisations. Terrorism does not represent any civilisation.
Terrorism negates everything that is human. We need a coalition against terrorism, but we also need a coalition against poverty.
The World Bank has recently published information on the consequences of the attacks on New York for developing countries.
We must not only deplore the loss of thousands of lives in New York and Washington. We must also lament the fact that there are tens of thousands of other victims amongst the children of the poorest countries in the world.
These are the people we must respond to.
Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I wish to say that we believe the Stability and Growth Pact is an essential pillar of economic stability in the euro area and in the Union more widely, and should be respected in letter and spirit.
We do not recognise the view, apparently emanating from the Socialist Group, that the SGP currently incorporates unnecessarily restrictive fiscal rules.
For the 11 countries whose budgets are in a sustainable position - those which, in other words, can face a normal recession with a fall in tax revenue and continue to respect the 3% limit on budget deficits - there is no need to raise taxes or cut public spending and the automatic stabilisers can and should be allowed to play.
Moreover, for many of these countries, this is the first slowdown since the first oil shock in 1973 in which the automatic stabilisers have been able to work fully.
Previously, financial market worries have been a serious constraint on governments.
So monetary union, the Stability and Growth Pact and fiscal consolidation have given back to Member States a useful policy lever which has been out of the policy box for too long.
For the four euro-area Member States whose budgets are not yet fully compatible with the Stability and Growth Pact - France, Germany, Italy and Portugal - it is wholly reasonable that they should continue the process of putting their underlying budget positions right.
This means allowing some effects of the slowdown on the deficit, but certainly not all.
In our joint motion with the PPE-DE Group we urge the proper respect of the SGP.
We point out that it would be particularly useful in a year like this one - in which many stability programmes were drafted in expectation of 3% growth, but the out-turn is likely to be less than 2%, as the Commission has said - if there were a commonly agreed measure between the ECB, Ecofin and the Commission of the underlying budget balance, stripping out the impact of the slowdown on taxes and cyclically determined spending and, perhaps, interest rates as well.
Such an underlying budget balance would allow better between-years monitoring of the fiscal position, underpinning the discipline of the Stability and Growth Pact and reassuring the financial markets that the fiscal stance is not being eased, even if the nominal deficits are inevitably somewhat larger.
Similarly, such an underlying budget balance would discourage finance ministers from fiscal easing in upturns, merely on account of cyclically buoyant revenue.
I urge us to respect the Stability and Growth Pact and add to its ability to check finance ministers' discipline.
Mr President, Madam President, Commissioner, much has already been said about the issue of the Growth and Stability Pact.
I think that the main difference between the two joint motions for resolution submitted to the House is the fact that the motion for resolution signed both by my group and the Socialist Group lays greater stress on the possibility of implementing a contracyclical policy. This policy would promote growth, while keeping within the limits of the Growth and Stability Pact.
If I understand the declaration made by the presidency correctly, it seems that the presidency supports this idea that the Growth and Stability Pact should allow the European Union to implement a contracyclical policy to promote growth.
That said, we must not be under any illusions. There is relatively little room for manoeuvre within the terms of the monetary and budgetary policies.
I would now like to comment on one aspect of the debate. This has not yet been mentioned but I, at least, am concerned about it.
As you know Commissioner, Madam President, practically all Member States have engaged in a structural reduction of government revenue (as a percentage of GDP) through fiscal reductions. This is being done within the context of fiscal harmony between Member States, especially through corporation tax, and within the context of weak growth.
This type of policy entails the risk of downward pressure towards a structural reduction of public spending. This could lead to insufficient spending, given the solidarity mechanism we endorse.
Alternatively, it could lead to inequitable public spending.
This is why it is important to debate the development of other tax bases. It seems that the presidency has alluded to and taken heed of this possibility.
In this regard, the Tobin tax may also contribute to widening the range of tax bases. However, Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to find out from you about the progress of work within the Prima Renault group, and about the state of discussion on the issue of corporation tax.
I believe that it is urgent for the fifteen Member States to find a way out of the impasse they have got themselves into. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is no longer informed on how this work is progressing.
When we do hear rumours on this subject, all we hear is that no progress has been made. When growth is slowing down, I believe that, as a matter of urgency, the European Union should pull itself together and coordinate work on the development of corporation tax.
Secondly, I would like to comment on the problems of terrorism and money laundering.
The principal elements concerned are the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) and the issue of the directive on money laundering.
Experts in this field judge progress made so far on international cooperation on this area to be limited and not very effective. Signatory countries are not obliged to implement the series of recommendations the FATF has produced.
In October 1996, European magistrates signed the Geneva Appeal, which called for certain international conventions to be ratified, and for banking secrecy to be lifted when proceedings have to be started.
One of these magistrates has recently repeated this appeal, calling for an international conference to consider these matters. The conference would define the rules on economic transparency, including lifting banking secrecy and abolishing tax havens.
It would also increase judicial cooperation between states and set up a system of sanctions to be imposed on countries that failed to comply with these provisions. I urge the President and the Commission to see that the Belgian Presidency acts upon these requests magistrates are making.
Indeed, the head of FATF has reiterated these same demands, as I have read in the press this morning. Work on these issues should proceed more quickly and FATF recommendations should be made binding.
This would be a very useful role for the European Union to play, both in its capacity as the Chair and a key member of the FATF.
I believe that we will be able to turn words into actions.
I also believe that, as regards the fiscal package, which includes binding provisions to regulate tax havens and low-tax areas (some of which can be found within the European Union), we can combine the fight against financial crime and the European tax on savings programme. I believe that we must seize this political opportunity to step up work on these issues.
Unfortunately, the informal meeting of ECOFIN had to announce, yet again, that no progress had been made in this area.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the dogmatism and apathy dominating the economic policy of the European Union are causing great concern.
Unemployment is rising once again, there is a threat of recession and the conditions for lasting growth are not in place. However, so far, the Council, the Commission and the European Central Bank have come up with platitudes and have convinced themselves that everything is fine.
The euro does provide protection against currency speculation but it offers no protection whatsoever from financial crises. We are involved in financial globalisation up to our necks.
The main cause of the current apathy is the fundamentalist approach of those opposed to state intervention.
Those who subscribe to this view try desperately to promote fiscal competition, as Pierre Jonckheer reminded us. They reduce public spending but welcome turgidity on the stock exchange and its requirements to produce financial returns.
This results in a lack of public and private investment.
Another reason for this apathy is that social-democratic visions for Europe are somewhat lacking.
I think it is time we recognise this.
You advocate strengthening coordination between national policies.
I am in favour of this, but we must recognise that basically this has come to be equated with the Growth and Stability Pact.
I am sure you will confirm this. The debate must not remain polarised between the 'fundamentalists' and those who want to make the Growth and Stability Pact more flexible.
We advocate an action plan to get us out of this rut.
Firstly, as elected representatives at a European and national level, we must come to a consensus and call for a revival of the European economies. We must send a message along these lines to a meeting of the European Council in Ghent and to the Commission.
In order to achieve economic revival, we must favour public spending and credit as opposed to tax cuts. Funds to promote investment should also be established.
Secondly, we believe that we must carry out an in-depth revision of the Growth and Stability Pact. This Pact has remained unchanged since 1992, although the global situation is now very different and the euro has appeared.
I appreciate the idea of starting to make it more flexible, as mentioned by Mrs Neyts.
However, we want something more than this. We want reform.
Two principles should guide us in this. Public or mixed economy choices should balance market forces.
Must I point out that President Bush used Keynesian policies to revive the American economy, after President Clinton refused to cut taxes to increase his popularity?
Furthermore, the criteria of state intervention should allow for decision-making at national level and for solidarity.
Restricting public deficit to a maximum of 3% in no way succeeded in preventing the exacerbation of differences.
Consequently, the new Growth and Stability Pact would be based on common criteria for effectiveness, relating both to taxation and public spending.
Taxation should combat the volatility of the financial markets and government stocks by taxing financial products and revenues.
Spending should create the necessary conditions for lasting growth, employment, security and solidarity.
We also want the Pact to include taxation and budgetary tools appropriate to the European Union. Fortunately, the Belgian Presidency has suggested this.
Thirdly, the Laeken declaration must include a commitment to establishing Community powers in relation to macro-economic policy.
Madam President, I welcome the opportunity to make a few, but important, points on the Stability and Growth Pact.
There is a role for economic policy coordination, but it must be applied in a sensible and balanced manner in all Member States.
There are, however, serious policy differences between what the Commission is now proposing and what was agreed at the Ecofin Council in Helsinki in 1999, when it was agreed that Member States 'determine their budgetary policies in consistency with the Treaty' , but that this commitment leaves room for domestic policy choices.
This week the Commission published a welcome White Paper on European governance, the thrust of which reflects the need for EU institutions to listen, rather than dictate.
There is a clear signal coming from EU citizens that while they continue to support the thrust of EU integration, they want it to happen in a manner which reflects the independence and the integrity of each Member State and its citizens.
There are those in this House, and indeed within the administration, who are blindly rushing towards the creation of a federalist Europe.
They are in my mind doing a disservice to the vision of Europe's founding fathers and will, I predict, be stopped in their tracks by citizen reaction.
Events in the real world can rarely be dealt with by means of a predetermined, prescriptive set of rules.
Over-regulation stifles initiative and, therefore, progress and prosperity.
Mr President, yet again the European Union is not keeping pace with the situation in Europe, as it wishes to keep European economies within the shackles of the Growth and Stability Pact. We all know that the criteria of this Pact are now completely obsolete.
The Growth and Stability Pact is dead, Mr Von Wogau; it did not die in New York.
It was killed off by the European Central Bank.
The Bank' s policies were always out of line with reality. Its forecasting errors are now legendary, and it has an irrational fear of inflation.
We are all aware of the results. We have to contend with the highest interest rates in the world, a consistently weak euro and the threat of recession.
The outcome of pursuing monetary policy in the manner of a frightened old man is clear. Sooner or later, governments will be forced towards budgetary expansion.
It would be ridiculous now to blame them for doing this. Many members of the committee have made this abundantly clear in all our conversations (if you can call them that) with Mr Duisenberg.
Once again, the European Union is unworthy of the powers it has assumed from legitimate governments. It has proved this by failing to order (this is a euphemism) the European Central Bank to make available to the countries of the euro area the resources entrusted to it by Member States.
As far as we know, the ECB does not own Europe' s currency and should not act like Scrooge.
I would also like to point out in passing that it is unacceptable for the ECB to decide whether or not to issue euro notes and coins before 1 January.
I have to say that I really cannot understand why some governments do not wish to take the initiative and bring the date of distribution forward.
Yet again the European Union cannot keep pace with its ambitions and assertions. It has failed to take up a position at the forefront of the drive to promote economic growth and employment.
This is the only battle that matters to the people of Europe.
Lastly, Commissioner, Madam President, let me add that the hypocrisy surrounding the issue of the Tobin tax added nothing to the intellectual standing of the European Union. For once, the European Union had the opportunity to show that it intended to have an effect on world affairs, to become more than what it actually is, simply one more piece of the jigsaw of liberal globalisation.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Italian Radicals supported the resolution of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party because they consider it of vital importance that Parliament confirms the validity of the Stability and Growth Pact and its principles.
I feel that rigorous budgetary and monetary policies are not incompatible with growth, provided that we have the courage to act in the areas of structural reform, privatisation, liberalisation of the markets - particularly the labour market - and public spending, and provided that we have the courage to resolve the complex issue of pensions expenditure, which is an excessive burden on the budgets of many European countries and, because of the way these systems are organised, creates situations which are extremely unfair towards the young generations of workers.
I am quite aware that the European countries - I refer to my own country, Italy, in particular, but also to others such as Germany - rested on their laurels during the economic boom, putting off reforms which were necessary in order to consolidate public finances and make businesses competitive and giving way to pressure from trade unions and employers' associations demanding more State aid.
Thus, they failed to prepare the European economies for the inevitable subsequent slowdown, which will be particularly severe in the wake of the events of 11 September.
Mr President, in my opinion, the fiscal burden in Europe is still too high: although it has fallen somewhat, it is true, the figures show that the fiscal burden in Europe is still significantly higher than it was in the early nineties, for example.
Derogating from the constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact now and resorting to deficit spending means storing up fresh tax increases for the coming years which, in my opinion, the European economy, the European workers and the European unemployed can on no account afford.
There is one danger which must be highlighted - Mr Goebbels mentioned the confusion following the events of 11 September - and that is that Europe will use the current economic crisis and the crisis in the United States as an excuse to go back to expansionist, deficit spending policies such as those experienced by Europe and its citizens in previous decades.
This is not the right response to the situation.
The argument that the United States is also reacting with an expansionist policy and that it is going to spend an additional 1% of its GDP disregards the fact that the United States is supported by healthy, buoyant public finances and therefore has the capacity to do so reasonably effectively.
The same would not be true if we were to implement similar policies in Europe or to support State airlines which have drained public resources and hampered the liberalisation of the European markets.
I would like to stress one last point relating to the fight against terrorism and its funding.
Something which is now increasingly being emphasised by expert analysts - recently even by the winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics, Gary Becker - is the fact that the multinational terrorist organisations are financed by drug trafficking, particularly where Afghanistan and Pakistan are concerned.
We must also explore the possibility of cutting off this channel of terrorist funding at source through drugs policies not based on prohibition.
Mr President, the debate taking place today on the supposed choice between the Growth and Stability Pact and budgetary expansion seems somewhat bizarre. In fact, we do not have a choice between these two alternatives.
On the one hand, the Growth and Stability Pact is too rigid an instrument, despite offering some opportunities for derogation, because it does not make proper provision for the time-lags between the economic cycles of the various Member States.
We have consistently pointed this out.
However, the Council has just suggested that it might eventually be possible to make adjustments according to the economic climate, and using a bit of skill and the excuse of the attacks, we can therefore expect the Pact to be more flexible.
On the other hand, budgetary expansion in countries that have suffered the biggest slowdown, like France and Germany, has had three main effects.
Firstly, these countries already have significant budgetary deficits. This limits their margin for manoeuvre and has already acted as a stimulus.
As is the case with drugs, a greater stimulus is needed to achieve the maximum effect.
However, eventually the dose will have to be reduced.
The second effect of this expansion is that the excessive undervaluing of the euro has led to an increase in exports. This is due to the fact that the euro is an artificial currency.
This has been unfair on our partners but has boosted internal growth. However, I am not sure that this might not have contributed, to a very small degree, to the slowdown in the United States over recent months.
The third effect of budgetary expansion is the dispersal of cash people have been hoarding, prior to the introduction of euro notes and coins on 1 January next year. No one ever mentions this, but it is nevertheless happening.
This laundered money has been reinvested in the economy in very significant amounts. The figures for France total FRF 50 billion this year.
This is already causing revival. Further budgetary expansion would have no purpose.
It would only lead to the eventual introduction of new taxes which would make the situation even more difficult in future.
The real question we should be asking ourselves is: given the three linked elements necessary for economic revival I have mentioned, why are we not experiencing an economic boom?
Apart from the unexpected effects of the attacks in America, which have yet to be firmly established, I think there are two reasons for this.
The first reason is that the economies of Europe are overburdened with many different taxes and rigid regulations. The policies of the Socialist French government, especially the absurdity of the 35-hour working week, made these problems particularly acute in France.
The second reason relates to the perverse effect of the euro. I have said this before, but I will mention it again.
The euro may to some extent prevent some fluctuation in internal exchange rates, as supporters of the currency take great pleasure in explaining time and again. However, on the other hand, it imposes a single monetary policy on countries which find themselves in very different situations.
This 'one-size-fits-all' policy, to quote one economist, is not suited to the present situation of France and Germany. It is having a recessionary effect in these countries.
It seems clear that the recessionary effect of standardisation today rather outweighs the benefits of eliminating internal exchange rates.
If we consider the situation as a whole, the euro is not protecting us from recession but rather encouraging it.
Should we put up with greater budgetary deficits to compensate for the euro?
That would be truly paradoxical!
In any case, Mr President, given the direction Europe has taken, we will have to endure several more years of problems and tension before governments recognise this essential truth: all countries fare better if each can benefit from an economic policy suited to its individual requirements.


Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, the present political situation in the world, and the war against terrorism that has begun, have a host of features that are creating long-term uncertainty for the EU economy.
That is why economic policies to create confidence will perhaps have an unparalleled impact on the behaviour of consumers and investors, and, hence, on how long the period of slower growth will last.
There are also certain positive signs, from the point of view of restraint and the stability of currency values. The price of crude oil is falling rather than rising and the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have, since 11 September, been taking prompt action and acting in accord with one another.
Now, after the Federal Reserve' s drop in interest rates yesterday, all eyes are on the ECB.
It is no good waiting.
May the approach to the solution remain in the hands of the independent ECB, but the future of the policy on interest rates in Europe must also be made clear quickly.
Firm commitment on the part of every country to the Stability and Growth Pact will create just the sort of confidence the pact itself seeks and the economy now needs.
Budgetary discipline must not be allowed to slacken in the EU countries on any pretext, not even on account of any possible expenditure to increase internal and external security.
Equivalent savings will have to be found: we cannot rely on some hoped-for continued growth of income.
Switching to the euro will mean slightly increased costs for all points in the production chain.
There is no denying that.
However, they will be one-off increases and will only raise prices slightly.
They should not be used for scaremongering and thereby increase inflationary pressures.
The best long-term policy for stability and growth now is to adhere closely to the decisions of the Lisbon Summit and make the European Union the world' s most competitive area, removing internal barriers to competition and giving encouragement to innovation and research and development.
The commencement of a new round of WTO talks is now vital for international cooperation in matters of the economy to steadily gain strength.
Mr President, representative of the Council, Commissioner, in my view, our economic policy is a combination of success and failure.
The success, of course, is the euro, the failure is the actual economy, where there are two, interconnected problems.
The low rate of growth and the high rate of unemployment.
The reason for both is the same and lies in the low rate of investment in capital equipment during the last decade of the last century, accompanied by the collapse of public investment.
Some people maintain that this collapse is a virtual collapse because it is due to a simple change of name, in that the private sector is investing where the public sector used to invest.
But how are we to believe this when overall investments have fallen so low?
Did public investment have to be throttled in order to support the euro?
Did unemployment have to reach its present rate, albeit not as high as just two years ago, although it will no doubt rise again, Commissioner, in order to support the euro?
I do not think so, but although no one admits it, this was the official policy up to the European Council in Lisbon.
That was where the line was taken to adopt the new economy which is supposed to find a modern solution to Europe's economic problem and bring back full employment on the new basis of more advanced technology, the most advanced technology in the world.
Nice words, nice ambitions, nice vision.
Unfortunately it failed because this was when the bubble burst on the American stock exchange, especially in the new technology and telecommunications sector, which was supposed to lead us into a new era and which is now threatening to drag us into one of the biggest slumps of the twentieth century.
It seems to me that these events have drawn a line under the Lisbon vision and that we need to go back to the drawing board.
There is no way someone can have a full plan to present to you, not when all our study institutes deny the need for us to change our economic policy.
But some things seem to be self-explanatory.
The European economy needs investment, the private sector is not investing enough because we insist on preventing the public sector from supplementing its investments - is that how we are going to revive the private sector's interest?
By refusing to make use of the possibilities offered by the Treaty and exempt investments from the definition of deficit in the Stability Pact?
I heard Mr Della Vedova refer in trepidation to 'deficit spending' .
Things may have got out of hand in the era of 'deficit spending' but, let us not forget that, in that era, the rate of growth was 5% and unemployment never exceeded 1 to 1.5%, while our current economic policy, based as it is on a high degree of liberalisation of the markets, is a long way from being such a success.
America came close in the last five years of the last century in a climate of excessive speculation and look where that has got us now.
Also, I should like to ask you, Commissioner, as you did me the honour of allowing me to ask you in private: what is the scientific criterion for refuting your position that will make you tell us that our position has been refuted and that we need to change economic policy?
As I am sure you know, without refutability there can be no scientific standpoint.
We keep getting caught in a huge tautology and I am afraid that this is precisely the economic policy which you support.
Mr President, so as to appease the Commissioner and the other honourable Members, may I state for the record that I am not a fan of deficits, of increasing public debt or of inflation.
However, that is not the issue.
Are we forecasting a slump, yes or no?
Some say, wait and see what happens.
But if it does happen, then it will be too late.
Others say, wait and the problem will resolve itself.
Some take cold comfort in the belief that our economy will rally once the economy rallies in the United States and totally ignore the fact that, with globalisation, if that happens, others will benefit from the recovery.
All the wrangling, as a number of honourable members have already said, is about avoiding the notion of public intervention in the economy.
I fail to understand why.
What is the point in being dogmatic, when you have specific problems and, more to the point, the problem of a slump in front of you?
Some of us can imagine various scenarios which marry public intervention with economic stability, that is, increased earnings, without creating the alarming fiscal competition which some people are projecting?
The problem is, we need public expenditure, we have the potential to generate public earnings which do not affect the productive structure or development of the economy or its competitiveness.
Surely you do not mean to tell me that you would have a problem if someone somewhere did something about annuities or the international speculators throwing hot money around on the stock exchange, or even about the excessive wealth and the frantic consumption of our inflated upper middle classes.
We have no scientific answer.
We are dogmatic.
No to the public sector and no to a Europe which, if it did all this - because only Europe can do all this - would be a federalist Europe.
Well, I have never heard such dogmatism in my life!
Mr President, the tragic events in America have sent severe economic shock waves through the world.
No country will remain immune to the economic impact of the horrendous terrorist attacks in America.
Those attacks were so severe that it will be some time before the extent of the economic fallout is fully known.
We are already seeing the first economic ramifications of 11 September, a day that will be etched on the memory of us all for evermore.
Job losses are mounting in the airline industry.
The jobs shed at many European airlines will never be filled again.
These job losses in turn affect nearly every aspect of an economy.
Consumer and investor confidence is waning, the value of global and stock markets is down too.
The one encouraging sign is that the euro currency is surviving strongly.
We can now all see the importance of the single European currency and the fact that there are 12 currencies participating within the single European currency regime is lending stability to the European economy.
There could be nothing worse than having 15 independent floating currencies operating within the European Union at the moment.
This would be a recipe for international speculators to come in and play one currency off against another.
We all recall the devaluations which took place in 1992, when the international currency speculators played havoc with the European stock markets.
Thankfully they are not in a position to do so again now, because we have a stable currency operating in Europe and surviving the recent economic shocks.
The terrorist attacks will not affect the timetable for the introduction of euro notes and coins, which will proceed as planned.
It is also clear that the European Central Bank and the various national euro changeover boards have done an excellent job in marketing the new euro economy.
While I have no doubt that there will be some teething problems, we shall overcome them and by the end of the changeover period the citizens of Europe will be fully cognizant of the value of the new euro notes and coins.
Mr President, the resolution by the ELDR Group and the PPE-DE Group has received my backing.
I have always been in favour of strict compliance with the criteria of the Stability Pact.
In this time of uncertainty, extra alertness is called for.
Various Member States are entering the danger zone.
A major advantage of budgetary discipline is manifesting itself: room for automatic stabilisers.
I would like to note in this connection that increasing expenditure is no solution.
What will prove decisive is the quality of the Stability Pact in combination with the necessary reforms in the economy as a whole.
The resolution mentions that the distribution of authority between the Member States and the Union leads to negative action at Member State level.
The reverse is also true.
The Union' s monetary decisions can adversely affect a Member State, for example, in the form of high inflation due to an unwelcome drop in interest rates.
I welcome the attention that this area of tension is receiving.
Thanks to the EMU' s favourable effect, the European economy can become more stable.
Time will tell whether this is proportionate to the loss of custom-made solutions for the Member States.
Budgetary discipline will be crucial in obtaining this stability.
- (ES) Mr President, by this stage in the debate it seems to me that three things must already be clear to us.
Firstly, we know that the European industrial sector is currently experiencing a graver crisis than the one it went through as a result of the 1998 financial crisis.
Secondly, we know that the crisis currently afflicting the world economy is far more serious than the one it underwent in 1993, after the Gulf War. This is because for the first time since 1929, the three largest economies are affected, namely the economies of the United States, Europe and Japan.
Thirdly, except for Mr Abitbol we all know that nowadays the European economy is far better prepared to cope with such a crisis.
As stated earlier, we now have a single currency to protect us from exchange rate crises.
We also have a policy to protect us from exorbitant price rises. In addition, we have a Stability Pact to safeguard us against the munificence of public administrations.
We do not know for certain but we suspect that this crisis is not demand led, like the post-war crisis. Nor is it a supply driven crisis like the one following the Yom Kippur war.
Rather, it is a crisis of confidence. As such, what distinguishes our motion for a resolution from the one put forward by the left is not that they wish to grow while we do not.
Obviously, we all want to grow.
Nevertheless, some recipes will move us forward whilst others will put us into reverse.
We believe that our recipes will move us forward.
Allow me to explain the reasons why I think as I do.
If this is a crisis of confidence, it would be a fundamental error to relax monetary policy and allow price rises. That would hole consumer confidence below the water line.
Secondly, because revising the Stability Pact would amount to indicating that we wish to pass this burden on to future generations, and that is certainly not a confidence booster.
Thirdly, if we relax the budgetary policy enshrined in the Stability Pact we shall prevent interest rates from being lowered, as the Americans are doing.
A vessel is not assessed according to whether there is a storm around or not, but according to how it weathers a storm.
In my view, it is now clear that we should change the way we navigate.
The European Central Bank may be driven to reduce interest rates, but it must bear in mind that its ultimate aim is to maintain the dogma of price stability to maintain consumer confidence.
It is likely that some governments who have done their homework will be able to allow the automatic stabilisers to operate. They will not need to compensate for fiscal reduction by increasing taxes or reducing expenditure.
Unfortunately, governments who have failed to do their homework and behaved like prodigal sons will not find themselves in such a fortunate position.
Thirdly, as the Commissioner has said, though previous speakers failed to mention it, it is time for Europe to move ahead and take a determined step forward to get the Lisbon process under way. This process aims to create a modern, innovative and competitive society.
Regarding the Tobin tax, the Commissioner was far more convincing in the interview he granted the Vanguardia Digital, when he said it was a useless tool, than in his speech today. Today the Commissioner stated it was one more potential tool.
Previously the Commissioner stated it was not possible. Now it begins to appear probable.
I endorse what he said to the newspaper but not what he said in the House.
Mr President, all possible measures must be taken to ensure that Europe can provide a real answer to the consequences of the horrendous terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, and a part of that, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, has in fact already been done, namely a joint response from the EU finance ministers.
I think this symbolises Europe's ability to close ranks when the chips are really down.
I believe that this policy should also be pursued further in relation to aid policy.
However, it should also give us the flexibility we need, so as to demonstrate that Europe does not want the economic downturn to be further exacerbated.
We do in fact have a Stability and Growth Pact that gives us many possibilities, because on the one hand we wish Europe to be a Community of stability, and on the other hand we also want to promote growth and employment.
It is no accident that when applying the convergence criteria, exceptional circumstances have sometimes been applied and approved which allow the definition of an excessive deficit to be deviated from.
I do not mean by that to speak in favour of a 'Community of instability' .
Just the opposite in fact, I wish to call on the Belgian Presidency and the Commission to contribute to further coordination in this area, by taking advantage of the fact that stability programmes can be updated.
I would like to see updated stability programmes for the euro countries which make it clear that the data has significantly changed.
What is needed in this context, as you quite rightly said yourself, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, is for us to avoid procyclical policies in Europe, in both the expansionist and restrictive senses. However, we can only do that if we can compare cyclically neutral budget data with structural deficits in updated budget figures.
I think that it would be helpful if the excitement that this debate has generated in this House led to further progress being made both in economic policy and in stability policy.
I say that because the European Union needs both monetary stability and employment and social stability.
Firstly, I would like to thank you for giving me the floor.
Unfortunately, I cannot remain in the House for very long as I have a meeting at 4.30 p.m. with your contact group to debate the development of the Members' Statute. I regard this as an important subject and this is an important meeting.
I requested it myself. I will be back here in the House at 5.30 p.m. to respond to the many questions you wish to put to me.
I would therefore like to thank you very much for listening to what I have to say now.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that you all appreciated the importance attached to every word of my speech, and the significance of every adjective I used when I spoke on behalf of the Presidency of the Council and the Council itself.
Please excuse me if I do not now try to interpret my previous speech further.
I was speaking on behalf of the whole of the Council. Consequently, I think I explained clearly how our thinking is developing.
I also defined the limits ECOFIN and the ministers themselves have already set.
I then described the nature of the ongoing debate. Those of you, you are all here, will certainly wish to have experts available to monitor the development of this debate closely.
Of course, the conclusions of this debate are considerably more important.
I believe that we are, at last, more or less in agreement with the objectives we wish to achieve, even if there is less agreement on the best means of achieving them.
I am sure that this debate will continue.
However, I would like to make two brief observations of my own.
Mr Berthu, a longstanding colleague of mine, said that everything was so much better when each country had full control of its financial and economic instruments.
However, I must disagree with you on this point, Mr Berthu.
I have been around long enough to know that the reality was very different, and it was at that time too. Europe has experienced very serious financial and economic crises, and has found it extremely difficult to overcome them.
This is my first point.
I would now like to move on to my second point. I shall not quickly forget the time in the 1970s when people sang the praises of the deficit spending policy.
This was a time of economic slowdown in my country, and those in positions of responsibility praised the policy of deficit spending to high heaven.
It took us fifteen years to recover from the effects of this policy. I do not wish this policy to be implemented in the European Union.
However, everything I have heard here goes quite in the opposite direction. I am sure that you will make it your business to monitor this situation very closely and will be extremely vigilant.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Thank you for informing the House of the reason for your absence, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck.
Be assured that we wish you every success with such a sensitive matter.
Mr President, we are living at a time when it is becoming clearer that the Stability Pact functions as an obstacle to development and to economic and social cohesion: by considering monetary and nominal convergence as a priority, by making restrictive budgets mandatory, it prevents those countries with major difficulties from being able to engage in a policy of investment, particularly public investment, in a period such as the present one of slowdown in economic activity and the threat of international recession.
In various countries and from different sources warnings are being issued regarding the need to amend the Stability Pact and the priority being given to the monetarist policies of neo-liberalism.
This situation is being felt both in the more developed countries and in those where situations of the greatest inequality prevail and/or where threats of social tension are emerging.
In a country like Portugal, which has the lowest salaries, pensions and reforms in the European Union and the highest rates of premature school-leaving, accidents at work and poverty, the application of rigid timetables and deadlines and major restrictions on public spending and investment is unacceptable, because this will impede the country' s development and obstruct the way to economic and social cohesion.
The need for the immediate suspension of the Stability Pact is, therefore, very topical.
In a European Union that claims to be concerned with social problems, committed to the creation of jobs and the fight against social exclusion and poverty, maintaining monetary stability at any cost cannot continue to be considered as a priority, when we know that the consequences will be more unemployment, more salary restrictions and more poverty.
It is not a question of merely calling for some flexibility in the criteria of the Stability Pact and the implementation of the growth and stability programmes, which each country has had to present.
It is essential to engage in an in-depth revision of the objectives, criteria and foundations of the Stability Pact, starting from the premise that the budgets of the Member States must reflect the needs of each people and each country and not the interests of the financial groups that the European Central Bank is seeking to convey.
Mr President, Commissioner Solbes, we need more Europe, and the Stability Pact is a tool for building Europe.
It is a complex and anomalous tool, not found in textbooks and universities; in fact, it replaces a true economic and budget balance policy on a federal scale.
But in order to be effective, such a tool must be credible and based on definite rules and obligations that are respected by all.
Changing the rules during the difficult process of convergence, less than one hundred days before the birth of the euro proper, would therefore be a serious mistake.
The Stability Pact must not, therefore, be relaxed or have its deadlines or targets changed; any such approach would be merely short-sighted opportunism and disastrous for the building of Europe.
The Stability Pact should, rather, be strengthened, improved and made more efficient; targets that only refer to budget balances are no longer enough.
Budget balances are a necessary but not sufficient objective, because there will be a growing need to aim at quality in public spending and the medium to long-term sustainability of public finances in the individual euro countries; in this connection, it is sufficient to think of the pension deficit.
Commissioner, even a Stability Pact interpreted in the most responsible, far-sighted manner possible would do nothing for the credibility of our currency if there were not a massive acceleration in the process of completing economic union at the same time, with greater genuine convergence, greater social cohesion, greater development, greater liberalisation, and a greater market for services and energy.
Though we need therefore to comply with and value the Stability and Growth Pact, as much attention should also be devoted to the subject of the Lisbon agenda.
Unfortunately, the Stockholm European Council was a step backwards in this respect.
Commissioner, Minister, for the sake of the euro and our Europe, let us avoid similar steps backwards in future.
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe is not technically in recession, but it is clearly experiencing a situation of slower growth, and we cannot yet predict all the economic, political and social consequences that this will have.
Within this framework, many people are questioning the validity of the restrictive and fundamentalist way in which the Growth and Stability Pact has been interpreted and the consequences that this interpretation may have on the very process of development and cohesion in Europe.
The Stability Pact is a global commitment, which combines the realism of a specific macro-economic scenario with a healthy concern for the consolidation of public finances.
The Pact should be interpreted in its entirety and, obviously, if one of the terms of the equation is altered, the other term must be adjusted and made flexible.
I do not want to get into an argument with the followers of the school of single thought, who have, unfortunately, come to play a leading role on the European economic policy scene.
But I cannot refrain from stating that any true defence of the Growth and Stability Pact requires, first and foremost, an understanding of it.
Now, understanding it means that it is correct to agree, in an unfavourable international situation, to accommodate the unavoidable loss of income and the consequent increase in the public deficit, provided it does not exceed 3%, as Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck rightly stated.
This cannot and must not be confused with any laxity or inefficiency by the revenue authorities, much less with relinquishing in the medium term a policy of adjustment supported by budgetary procedures and a serious and ongoing effort to control public spending and improve administrative efficiency at every level. Controlling and streamlining public spending are worthy objectives.
We are not, therefore, talking about a revision or cancellation of the Stability Pact.
Consolidating spending does not mean irrationally demanding a linear reduction of deficits.
It does mean considering that in the medium term budgetary balances from one year should be balanced with those of the next.
Mr President, stability and growth are objectives of economic activity that everyone wants, whichever party or group in the European Parliament they belong to.
However, when it comes to defining these concepts and in particular when it comes to how we should achieve these objectives, then there are considerable differences between us.
A purely fiscal interpretation will not help us to solve the present problems, which are reflected in falling economic growth and consistently high unemployment.
The market economy as an economic concept is fine, but it is unacceptable as a social policy tool.
Or to put it another way, the market can and should regulate the economy, but not society.
We see the priority as being not a supply-oriented economic policy, but a demand-oriented one.
We do not believe that liberalisation is a panacea.
We need not only commercial competition, but also a linkage with economic and social criteria, in order to achieve the highest possible level of social security, sustainability and justice.
Balancing budgets is fine, but not at any price.
In contrast to the President-in-Office, I wish to call for an anticyclical economic policy.
In times of recession, increasing public expenditure on investment in new capacity and in education and training are essential.
We have the euro area, but we do not have a European economic, fiscal and social policy.
That cannot work.
It is not just a matter of achieving price stability alone, which is the ECB's remit, we also need to achieve socio-economic stability.
A more flexible approach to the existing convergence criteria will not solve the problem, it will just shift the burden to those who meet the criteria.
We need a new version that takes into account additional parameters such as the employment rate, the value-added ratio and the investment ratio, because these indicators reflect economic strength and development.
Mr President, Commissioner, the dark clouds of recession are looming in the west, in part due to the piercing of the asset bubble of the US stock market, but further exacerbated by the tragic events of 11 September.
The US Federal Reserve has now dropped the federal funds rate to 2.5% - a 39-year low.
This is the ninth rate cut this year.
The ECB may respond shortly, but almost two years since the euro's launch, there is as yet little enthusiasm for its future role as the major international reserve currency.
This is in part the result of exchange-rate weakness and, in part, because the notes and coins are not yet in circulation, so it cannot yet be heralded as an unqualified success.
It remains to be seen if the one-size-fits-all model of interest rates will work in all the countries of the Union, in particular countries like Ireland.
These concerns and the added concerns about constitutional implications and loss of sovereignty leave my country, the UK, happy to remain outside for the time being.
Although clearly we all wish the project well, it has frankly confounded many pessimists including our former Prime Minister John Major.
Some years ago, the Commission in its McDougal report concluded that central tax-raising powers of at least 7% of GDP would be needed to allow counter-cyclical spending and transfer payments to make a single-currency zone function properly.
This would, of course, have been anathema to Member States, so they decided instead on strict spending, borrowing and inflation limits in Dublin in 1996 as an alternative.
Recently, there have been calls to make these Stability and Growth Pact ceilings more flexible.
This is unwise in my opinion, as I believe firmly that a prudent approach to public finance and borrowing is a good thing.
Furthermore, the British economy is linked to and becoming more convergent with the euro zone, so we all have an incentive to stick to the guidelines and we must not allow the US crisis to be an excuse for new, big government tax-and-spend policies.
The Stability Pact includes mechanisms designed to operate in recession and Article 2.1 on the excessive deficit procedure could be used in exceptional circumstances to justify higher military or security spending.
But Member States should concentrate on structural reforms, particularly in their labour markets, as the way ahead.
Otherwise, we would only have high inflation and massive increases in the mountain of national debt.
Mr President, by a diabolical coincidence, it is aeroplanes that illustrate what sort of a world we are living in today.
There was the tragedy in New York and there were the events yesterday in another dimension, at another level, in the airports around Switzerland.
It may have been Swissair but it could equally easily have been Sabena or Olympic Airways or another airline.
You could say that we are dogmatic in the European Union about refusing to see what is going on around us.
That is our right.
But I think that to be dogmatic to the point where you refuse to see what even Mr Bush's government with its ultra-conservative economic philosophy and Mr O'Nill in the United States can see is taking things too far.
To refuse to see the 15 billion given to the airlines, to refuse to see that, for both political and economic reasons, international movements of funds need to be controlled somewhere along the line if we are to have both economic and political stability, to refuse to see that governments need to stop being petty and to take things in hand.
In this sense, I think that to abide dogmatically by a Stability Pact decided under different circumstances ten years ago is a big mistake.
Mr President, in the spring, the Council took a clear stance in favour of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Around the summer recess, a few finance ministers considered it necessary to express as their own personal opinion the fact that more scope was required in the Pact as a result of a declining economy.
This was apparently not an official government view because the requirements were not repeated on the platforms eminently placed to deal with this, including the ECOFIN Council.
Quite the reverse, in fact. On those occasions, warm words were spoken about the Pact.
Despite these fine words, President Duisenberg considered the talk of relaxing the rules very worrying.
Commissioner Solbes Mira even addressed Italy, France, Germany and Portugal in a stern manner and urged them to translate the agreements into action.
And he is right.
It is not acceptable for governments repeatedly to adopt a high tone and demand reductions in the interest rate from the Central Bank when they have failed to do their own homework.
If all Member States, when economic growth allowed for this, had taken the required structural measures, the Central Bank would now be able to be more flexible in its interest policy.
After all, there is a direct link between the budgetary policy and the interest policy in the policy mix.
Various MEPs have spoken about 11 September and Mr Herzog even went so far as to claim that the euro does not protect us against financial crises.
I think he is very much mistaken.
After 11 September, the Central Bank took action in an admirable manner and has most definitely shielded us from a financial cash crisis.
Some time ago, Ireland was severely punished when it gave another stimulus to an almost overheated economy, contributing further to high inflation.
As far as I am concerned, Ireland might serve as an example, but we should also be courageous, and level criticism at large countries. We should especially target those countries that fully deserve the criticism.
And let us be aware of the fact that the financial markets are closely monitoring the way in which the Member States are currently handling their government budgets in a declining economy.
The current situation is a test of how sound the euro construction really is.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have had a very in-depth discussion of this subject today.
I have gradually been sensing that this debate has made it clearer and clearer how justified the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats was in taking the initiative to table this motion, and how important that was.
There are 89 days to go until the euro notes and coins come into circulation, and on top of that challenge we are living in very uncertain times.
At the same time there have been reactions in some governments around making the Stability and Growth Pact an issue. We have already heard the names of certain people in some governments who have not done their homework properly when it comes to the Stability and Growth Pact.
For that reason it is particularly important in these uncertain times and with 89 days to go before the euro comes in, to convey a sense of clarity and calm to the markets and also to consumers.
Europe's Stability and Growth Pact will not be shaken.
That is why it is necessary to counter the idea that weakening the Stability and Growth Pact is a way of acting to prevent a recession.
It is simply not true that inflation can create jobs.
And it is not true that the Stability and Growth Pact did not allow enough leeway for hard times.
The Member States that have the greatest leeway are the ones that have done most of their homework.
So I can only urge you not to play with fire.
It is irresponsible to add to uncertainty at a time when things are already uncertain, and the Stability Pact is a requirement for the stability of the euro.
Mr President, the object of the Stability and Growth Pact is to achieve lasting stability in the financial markets, which have remained a national responsibility since the beginning of the single currency.
This means that the Stability Pact is a necessary counterpart in financial policy terms to the policy of monetary union and it is a financial policy substitute for political union, which did not come into being at the same time as monetary union.
The objective of the pact is to ensure that there is sufficient leeway in budgets when times are good and to make provision for bad times.
Some Member States, including Germany, have failed to do this recently.
However, no sooner have the first difficulties appeared than people have started talking about how the criteria are interpreted.
The usual criticism is that although the pact promotes stability, it also acts as a fiscal straitjacket and thus exacerbates weakness in monetary growth.
This criticism fails to take account of the facts.
The commitment made is to balance budgets in the medium term and to limit deficits, and it cannot therefore be thrown up in the air as soon as growth subsides.
That is why a clear signal is needed from ECOFIN, especially after the discussions that have taken place.
With just three months to go before the euro comes into circulation, as Mr Karas mentioned, we need a sign of stability.
The problem is that we have failed to achieve the Lisbon objective of becoming the region with the strongest growth in the world.
But we can only achieve that objective if the Member States do their homework.
They cannot blame this on the European Central Bank.
I would also like to take issue with Mr Tannock for suggesting that the ECB has not met its objectives during this period of crisis.
The ECB in particular has reacted very well since 11 September, and the euro has held up.
However, the fact that we were already discussing the Stability and Growth Pact before 11 September meant that we were playing with fire, as Mr Karas put it, and causing uncertainty.
If we had not done that we would be able to debate the future of the euro in a far calmer way now.
Mr President, with only a few days before the introduction of the euro, I believe we should most of all avoid the risk of confirming a contradiction between convergence and stability policies on the one hand and, on the other, policies aiming at sustaining the processes of growth and lasting development, in accordance with the objectives of the Lisbon Summit.
Bearing in mind the implementation of planned and existing automatic stabilisers, I think the objectives set in the Stability and Growth Pact should not be presented or seen as obstacles to growth or the need to respond - politically too - to the consequences of a downturn in the economic climate like the one we are now going through.
Furthermore, I believe it would be just as wrong to present compliance with the Stability Pact objectives as being a sufficient or, worse still, the only possible reaction to a context with a clear risk of recession.
I believe that in such circumstances there is once again a need especially to speed up progress towards two goals.
The first is to specify and perfect tools of analysis and control, to ensure that public finances are used consistently and concomitantly in support of selective investment programmes that are strictly targeted and as such useful in an absolute sense - and even more necessary when compensating for the economic downturn.
The second goal, confirming the positive nature of the Stability and Growth Pact, is to adapt and consolidate it so it remains in operation beyond the time when it should have reached its objectives, thus improving the conditions and strengthening the tools for an effective Community economic policy.
Mr President, rather than talk about the Stability and Growth Pact I want to comment on another subject which was raised at the informal ECOFIN and with which this debate deals, and that is the Member States' ministers' call for Parliament's agreement on the Money Laundering directive.
I would like to echo that call for both colleagues across the European Parliament and governments across Europe to reach an agreement on this directive as soon as possible.
This has been made all the more crucial by the tragic events of 11 September.
Terror that day struck at the heart of the global financial system.
The terrorists were clearly prepared to use all the mechanisms and tools that the global financial system gave them in planning that attack.
Let us turn those tools against them.
Many bankers and finance workers died in that attack.
Let us enlist the help of those bankers and finance workers in responding to it and preventing a repetition thereof, because this is a concrete step that we can take in the war against terrorism.
No-one is going to ask us to go and die on an Afghan hillside, though others will be asked to pay that price.
But we too can - and should - make a contribution, because the bankers, brokers, cleaners, IT technicians, investment advisers, lawyers and caterers who spill off our trains into city centres in Frankfurt, Paris, London and Brussels are just the same as those 5000 or 6000 people who turned up for work in New York one day and will never ever come home.
The time has come to stop quibbling about lawyer confidentiality.
I call on this Parliament to agree to a directive which will help starve the terrorists of funds.
I call on it to agree to the freezing of assets of terrorist organisations, because someone, somewhere, is banking bin Laden's money.
We can help starve him of funds, which is as important a task as the military operation which we know will soon follow.
Mr President, Commissioner Solbes, ladies and gentlemen, at a time of particular international tension, I believe I can state that the Stability and Growth Pact is like a guarantee of our will to uphold all the restructuring plans and growth programmes that underlie the building of an economically strong, cohesive and genuinely competitive Europe.
Any idea of waiving or relaxing established plans would undermine the future development of the whole of Europe.
There is now an aspect that should also be given due consideration: the massaging of budget balance data so as not to reveal any anomalies that may still persist in certain public accounts.
Unfortunately, in this respect, we in Italy have had to face a sad legacy from the centre-left.
This is not the right attitude, certainly worse than that of failing to bring the economy into line with the required parameters. While the former case involves fraudulence, the latter is, it is hoped, just a momentary, temporary difficulty.
Such massaging of data should be clamped down on with no half measures and penalties can be imposed where appropriate.
In the context of the Pact and the general awareness that it should be observed, it cannot be ignored that certain areas or even entire regions - southern Italy, southern Spain, southern and part of northern France, and eastern Germany - are certainly behind the rest.
While the Member State as a whole must observe the pacts it has signed, it is also true that special relief measures for these areas - I refer to differential taxation, the use of unused Structural Funds for tax credits, new types of aid after 2006 for countries excluded from Objective 1 - should not only not be considered censurable but should be seen as desirable by all.
Mr President, I should like to thank all those who took part in the debate for their comments and contributions.
I shall start by pointing out that our economic situation is different from that of the United States.
The European Union' s point of departure is quite other from the United States' : our balances are not the same either, what has taken place in the United States has not taken place in Europe and, furthermore, our institutional framework is not the same.
In my view it would be unrealistic and undesirable to try to apply the American model to Europe.
It has emerged from the debate that some of you feel our main concern is to prevent public sector involvement.
That is not at all the case.
We have never conceived of this issue in terms of a public sector versus private sector debate. There is scope for more public investment.
There can be more public involvement, always of course within the rules laid down in the system we have created for ourselves to ensure more effective operation of the balance between monetary and fiscal policy.
The ECOFIN decision on airlines and insurance cover as a result of the political risks involved is a good example of the swift effect of public action.
The debate then moved on to focus on the Growth and Stability Pact.
Some of you are of the opinion that those of us in favour of the pact are adopting a fundamentalist position, others find it dogmatic. Some of you have even mooted the possibility of doing away with the pact altogether.
I would be inclined to side with the presidency and with those of you who have referred to something I consider crucial.
The Growth and Stability Pact is intended to serve as an instrument to facilitate anticyclical action by the public finances.
That was its original aim and remains its essential nature.
Hence there is no question of dogmatism or fundamentalism.
We could discuss whether our past experience, gained from implementing the pact during periods of growth, has led us to the conclusion that it is only applicable to that end.
True, in times of growth we were not particularly dogmatic as far as exhausting the possibilities of the pact with regard to reducing the public deficit in certain Member States. We may well be regretting that just now.
Returning to the logic enshrined in the pact, the pact does allow anticyclical actions.
There is no doubt that the pact' s flexibility is due to two fundamental elements.
The first concerns exceptional circumstances and it is not relevant to analyse these now, as exceptional circumstances are only invoked in times of deep recession or when growth has fallen below certain levels. The second element concerns the normal implementation of the pact through the operation of the automatic stabilisers.
In the specific case of the automatic stabilisers, the element of flexibility is contained in the pact itself. I can state quite clearly that in no way are we amending any position.
Rather, the nature of the pact provides accordingly.
In the code of conduct adopted by ECOFIN last July it was already stated that one of the fundamental elements of the Growth and Stability Pact is the medium-term objective for the fiscal position. It is made quite clear that assessment of the objective for the various countries should take explicit account of the cyclical position and its implications for the budget.
Clearly, as some of you have pointed out, this element will therefore have to be taken into account when adjusting Member States' stability programmes.
On occasion, the Commission has insisted that the cyclically adjusted deficit position should be included in information on the stability programmes. You are well aware, ladies and gentlemen, that we are experiencing technical difficulties.
The latter relate not only to the concept but also to the method of calculating this structurally adjusted position.
Obviously, rather than making us more flexible, this will allow us to apply the pact to a reality different from that which prevailed when the various stability programmes were defined.
It further implies as I said in my first speech, that in the Commission' s interpretation nominal objectives must not be considered set in stone.
The nominal objectives are linked to certain assumptions on growth.
Consequently, as I stated, there are no problems, there is flexibility and no dogmatism. Rather, we have moved on to a different stage as far as implementation of the Growth and Stability Pact is concerned.
Would an approach involving greater spending resolve the problems?
I do not believe it would.
Our position is that given the European experience in recent years, involving a rather procyclical approach to this type of decision, and having observed the difficulty experienced in regaining balance, it is not a wise option.
As I said in my opening speech, we therefore remain of the opinion that the best choice is to opt for more Europe. Some of you have argued along the same lines.
More Europe means Lisbon.
In the context of Lisbon, more Europe means increasing our potential growth.
More Europe means more efficient systems.
More Europe also means taking greater account of the impact of the crisis on the international markets. It also means taking into account factors as significant as international commercial negotiations on development aid, and all those related factors which will doubtless allow us to improve the context.
In conclusion, more Europe can also mean progress on issues linked to fiscal competence which some of you have referred to, ladies and gentlemen. There is no doubt about that.
More Europe will certainly mean progress in the fight against money laundering. All this is undoubtedly essential if we are to cope successfully with the tasks we have set ourselves.
A debate such as today' s warranted a much longer reply. Unfortunately however, we are running out of time.
Nonetheless, I was anxious to comment quickly on these ideas to make the Commission' s position on this final item quite clear.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I have received seven motions for resolution, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Television without frontiers
The next item is the report (A5-0286/2001) by Mrs Hieronymi, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the third report of the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee, on the application of Directive 89/552/CEE 'Television without frontiers' (COM(2001)9 - C5-0190/2001 - 2001/2086(COS)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the objective of the Television without frontiers directive is to establish an EU legal framework to promote the free circulation of audio-visual broadcasting services and to guarantee certain particularly important interests, such as pluralism, cultural diversity, and the protection of consumers and minors.
We have before us today the Commission's report on the application of the directive for the period 1997 to 2000.
The key points to emerge from this report are as follows.
The main objectives of the directive have been achieved, but a thoroughgoing revision of the directive is needed.
The five main points of the report, very briefly, are these: firstly, the directive has been implemented in 12 Member States, with three yet to follow suit.
Secondly, the television sector experienced an overall phase of continuous growth between 1997 and 2000.
This applies both to the number of television channels and also to the total turnover of radio and television broadcasters and to the advertising turnover of both state-owned and private broadcasters.
Nevertheless, the report indicates that when it comes to trade in television programmes, Europe has a deficit with the United States of some USD 2.9 billion, while the overall deficit of the audio-visual sector is some USD 6.6 billion.
Thirdly, the 50% quota for European works was clearly exceeded, except in Portugal, falling in a range between 53% and 81%.
Fourthly, although the provisions on the protection of minors were complied with overall, there needs to be better coordination in future.
Fifthly, four countries have so far made use of the new provisions under Article 3a about broadcasting events of particular importance to the community, and four others are planning to take advantage of those provisions, particularly for sporting events.
The committee noted shortcomings in the report with regard to implementation in the candidate countries and in the analysis of trends in media concentration.
The digital era is now on the way, and the integration of television, PCs and the Internet requires a fundamental revision of the TWF directive so as to create a European legal framework for broadcasting audio-visual material with various degrees of regulation.
The cornerstones of this should be as follows: first, the rules on advertising should be reviewed and made more flexible; second, the quota arrangements should be reviewed to see if they can continue to be a suitable instrument for promoting European works; third, we must guarantee open and compatible standards for various systems covering rights of access; fourth, there is a need for stronger and more effective self-regulation, particularly as regards the protection of minors; fifth, the trends in vertical and horizontal integration of the media should be analysed, and sixth, a review of the arrangements under Article 3a and how they are to be dealt within future is required.
I can therefore give my full support to Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 which have been tabled here.
The preparations for this review process should take into account the exceptional impact of television and new technology on democracy and society, particularly in the digital era.
The process of gauging public opinion therefore needs to be carried out openly, in a way that takes account of both experts in the audio-visual sector and the views of the public.
So I very much welcome the fact that the Commission has provided for a broad communication process, and we hope, Commissioner, that in view of the speed with which digital technology is developing you will bring forward your proposed review as soon as possible.
However, I would like to make an appeal to everyone: we must take advantage of the opportunities for dialogue over the next 18 months to demonstrate that the European Parliament cares about what matters to the public, especially when cultural issues are involved.

Mr President, I declare an interest as a director of a television documentary company, in which I am now not very active; but I retain my concern for the quality of our broadcasting and television.
I welcome Mrs Hieronymi's report and salute her for it.
It goes to the heart of the cultural diversity that we prize in Europe.
We defend public service obligations - however the service concerned may be financed - and the principles of universal access, which constantly come back in all of our debates now about technology.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has taken heed of the imbalance in the European audio-visual market place, and I hope the Commissioner will be able speak on this.
Since 1999 the revenues of European television companies have grown by an average of 46.3%.
In that time, public-service broadcasting hardly grew at all and creative television production in the five major producing countries of the European Union was sluggish or, in some cases, falling.
At the same time, US programme sales to Europe - programmes which, as we know, are reaping their tertiary reward, having already cleared their primary and secondary rewards in the US market directly and by satellite and cable - grew massively.
That is not a healthy situation.
The protection of the diverse market in Europe remains crucial.
The imperatives of the technology should be linked to what consumers need, as well as what the production empires want to sell.
Article 3a, referred to earlier by the rapporteur, shows what can be done to keep the widest audience for special events.
I too support Mrs Junker's amendments and others on the same point.
It was a major change for the better and it showed that we can intervene here and in the European Union.
We need to return to the issue of media concentration and how that relates to the public good, not just in terms of diversity but also in terms of raw political power.
Finally, we ought to be able to say to the applicant countries: do as we do and not merely as we say.
That means having rules that are observed, for them as well as for us.
Mr President, this directive, which was devised in 1989, bears the highly suggestive title 'Television without frontiers' , but one could not really have imagined that it would also be without time limits.
This area, which was subject to innovative legislation thirteen years ago, has clearly changed radically and to an amazing extent.
The same even applies to the update we passed in 1997: everything has been left behind by the driving force of new technologies and also fashion.
We are thus increasingly sure that the review of this directive, until now expected for 2002, will be brought forward to the beginning of next year, without waiting for too many months to go by.
The last five years have, in fact seen a veritable revolution in the television sector; the old TV has now become a supporting actor, a technical tool in the service of digital innovation, the webcasting invasion, the Internet and interactive relationships between user and broadcaster.
A global, up-to-date review is also needed because of all the other problems that directly or indirectly surround the world of television, such as the increase in turnover of the networks, the steady and increasingly disturbing invasion by advertising, the explosion of private broadcasters, and the growing social and moral implications of certain programming.
The scope of the directive needs to be broadened to embrace not only the subjects mentioned above but also others that are already included but are insufficiently developed, such as the problems of intellectual property, respect for children as often unsupervised users, the cultural levels of programmes - taking into account not only the interests and requirements of those who make them but especially the feelings of those at whom these products are targeted - and lastly the confrontation with American productions, a subject on which there was quite a harsh confrontation in 1997 but which remained to a great extent unresolved.
Lastly, on this subject, I also hope we can again discuss the so-called 'right to information' , a right which, because of equal opportunities, should clearly concern not only the citizens of the European Union but also all those living outside who receive programmes produced inside the EU.
It is not enough just to guarantee the great sporting events, as we did in 1997, since man does not live on football alone - if you will forgive the pun.
We must distribute constantly updated information, based on culture and constantly updated, not only to those who live within the European Union but especially to those less favoured by geographical location or social and economic status.
Everybody' s 'right to a satellite dish' is not enough: you need the money to get one.
Imagine what can come into houses through a dish in the remotest parts of the world.
The most precious aid is that reserved for the production of programmes designed to report, safeguard and make proposals, in the sense of safeguarding regional and local cultures.
Finally, let me renew an invitation to the Member States.
The rapporteur, whom I congratulate, and whose amendments and positions I support, reminded us that only twelve Member States have so far implemented the directive.
Well, Commissioner, let us take this opportunity to give the Member States this message again: believe in this directive, because it will become increasingly urgent, current and important, and if you believe us you must first of all implement it!
Mr President, we agree that revision of the Television without frontiers directive is urgently needed.
Firstly, it is needed because the context in which the televisual market operates, as it has been described, is so different from what it was when the directive was last revised that it does not seem feasible to retain the latter for a further two or three years.
As an estimate, we could say that at most, the directive only covers some 50% of the problems currently experienced in the sector.
Secondly, revision is required because we need to come up with solutions which were not provided at the time. Television remains the main source of information and entertainment for most Europeans.
In my view, apart from the issue of the low quality of content, it is beset by three main problems. Too much advertising is broadcast, with no thought for its suitability or the ages and timings involved.
Only rarely are European films broadcast, which is an affront to European culture.
The business of digitalising programmes so they can be shown on subscription channels has taken off.
Doubtless these problems already existed in 1996, but the situation is now critical.
This suggests that although the directive has been successful as far as the free circulation of television services within the Community is concerned, it has failed in other important areas.
The Commission' s communication does not allow us to assess the efforts Member States made to redress the situation in the three years under scrutiny.
Suffice it to say that three Member States did not even transpose the directive into their legislation.
Most probably, the results for the remaining Member States were not identical, but the Commission has not made such a comparative study available.
There is little detail on the situation in the candidate countries. This should feature prominently in the new directive.
For all these reasons, Mrs Hieronymi has refrained from launching an in-depth debate in her report. I believe she was wise to do so.
This debate should take place when the directive is revised, and she has requested such a revision.
A number of guidelines to inform the process have been laid down. I should like to refer to just a few of these, namely the urgent need to introduce new services based on new technologies, the need to stimulate and accelerate the transition to digital technology and the coordination of the new directive with the revision of the directive on electronic commerce.
The Socialist Group will therefore vote in favour of the report and endorse two amendments tabled by Mrs Junker. Regarding these amendments, I would like to highlight the need for Community legislation to ensure that events or shows of great interest to the citizens should be protected from digitalisation so that they can be made available to all social classes free of charge.
Mr President, Commissioner, while I would like, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to thank the rapporteur for this report, I would also like to echo the previous speaker in drawing attention to the future.
The Commission' s report states that the next report on the directive must also address issues which are important to the consumer, such as operational compatibility, conditional access and how the transition to digital broadcast technology will take place, but the world may already have moved on by the time the next report is drawn up.
I would like to remind everyone that, when debating the 'telecom package' , Parliament approved by a large majority the fact that we should demand an open, common standard for TV transmitters and receivers, the only one so far approved in Europe and known as the MHP standard.
This standard would guarantee a situation in which all consumers knew what applied and one in which they had the confidence to acquire the necessary equipment.
It would also guarantee that vertically divided markets did not arise.
A large majority of Parliament backed this view.
But what has happened since then?
The Commission does not support this decision, and the Council has entirely ignored the issue, which I believe is of immense importance if we are to achieve what is known as Digital Update and promote digital technology in all TV markets.
I therefore hope that the Commission in its entirety can start to support the demands which have been made by Parliament and which we in the ELDR Group would like to clarify a little.
The rapporteur has already pointed out this requirement, but I would like to repeat it in order to make it clear to all the services of the Commission.
Some have said that 'Television without Frontiers' is a loaded title for the directive.
There is also a special set of problems in this context.
In many cases we see that the directive has not functioned in the intended manner with regard to opinion-formers or individual consumers who wish to view TV from another country.
The Commission has found that the way in which copyright is handled prevents it from doing so.
I hope that this issue too will be debated in greater depth in the future.
Mr President, there are many who believe that this report does not go far enough in analysing the potential problems facing us as we embark on the revision of the Television without frontiers directive, expected in 2002 as we are all aware.
However, it raises some very important issues and it is important to start that dialogue now.
My personal concern is the role of public service broadcasters in this important agenda.
It is important to recognise that today's public service broadcasting needs to adapt to the changes.
Today's radio and TV sector is a competitive one and the market forces which largely govern it cannot be ignored.
Public service broadcasters have a crucial role to play in the digital world.
Public service broadcasters make programmes of high quality in indigenous languages reflecting indigenous cultures.
They also have a crucial role to play in encouraging people to use and understand the new digital media.
I agree with the Commissioner's statement in a recent communication that broadcasting and culture should remain within the WTO's services category and that this arrangement should be respected.
Having established that, we then need to be absolutely certain that there is sufficient scope for national and EU legislation to protect public services and cultural entities.
Robust and determined early regulatory action will be needed to create the open environment we all seek, and one which is in the real interests of all citizens and economies of Europe.
Europe has to compete in the digital world where consumers and citizens can wander freely and where competition delivers diversity and choice.
With its complementary mix then of private and public service broadcasters, the European audiovisual model guarantees pluralism of information, cultural diversity and access for all to information, education, entertainment and the arts.
I will be voting in favour of the report and look forward very much to the forthcoming debates as we look to the future.
Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work she has done and also the Commission on such an appropriate initiative.
Nevertheless, I would like to highlight three aspects which seem to me very important.
The first is the importance of the audiovisual sector in promoting sport.
We must not forget that sport contributes to forging an identity and bringing people together, as well as uniting sportspeople and spectators by offering the latter the opportunity to identify with their nation.
Furthermore, sport is one of the fields of activity which most affects and touches on the citizens of the European Union regardless of their age or social origin, and therefore sport cannot and must not be discriminatory and all the citizens of the European Union must be able to see sporting events.
They must not be a privilege for the few, since these events are of great importance to our society.
The second issue is the need to control advertising slots, and I therefore fully support the rapporteur when she backs the Commission' s strategy of carrying out a study on the repercussions of television advertising and TV shopping techniques on minors.
And the third issue I would like to highlight is my total support for the rapporteur' s request that the Member States strengthen dialogue and cooperation on all issues relating to the protection of minors and young people.
We cannot aspire to a world without violence when our future adults spend the day watching increasingly violent animated cartoons, films and news items.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2000 there were 152 households in the European Union with television sets able to receive over 580 different channels.
That implies a growth of around 180% in just four years.
These figures alone should be enough to illustrate that the conventional television market, which only covers a small part of the overall audio-visual sector, is a major growth sector.
The Commission report shows that the Television without frontiers directive, which was originally highly controversial in my own country in particular, has proved its worth.
It provides sensible conditions for international broadcasting.
In the period covered by the report, 50 channels were already aiming chiefly at markets outside their local area.
The TWF directive closed various regional legal gaps and created binding standards for areas including advertising and the protection of minors, thus creating a level playing field in terms of equal opportunities and competitiveness.
I welcome the way the Hieronymi report sets all this out.
However, it also makes it clear that we need to embark as quickly as possible on a new review of the TWF directive, if we are to keep pace with the fast-moving developments in the audio-visual sector in a time of increasing digitalisation.
That applies not only to the provision of all kinds of multimedia services, it also involves an appropriate approach to the trend in concentration of the media, which is also progressing at a pace that is hard to follow.
The other side of the coin is the need to ensure freedom of information, diversity of opinion and pluralism, and to establish an essential multimedia foundation to promote European cultural diversity.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Ruth Hieronymi on her excellent work on this issue.
Her achievement has been demonstrated by the wide consensus she has obtained on this important but extremely sensitive subject.
I agree with the general philosophy of her report and with the proposals it contains.
As regards the method used, I think it is regrettable that the results obtained were not evaluated in relation to the set objectives.
This would have produced a better picture of the real cultural and economic implications of this directive for each of the Member States and candidate countries.
On the other hand, I support the wish of the rapporteur and the Commission to propose a revision of the directive, and to do this in parallel with the revision of other directives, after initiating three in-depth studies. Only an overall approach will lead in the medium term to the development of a coherent and forceful policy.
Please note I am talking about an approach. This is something that the directive does not at present provide.
The audiovisual sector has undergone profound changes. New services have necessitated new technologies and have also led to an increase in the number of broadcasters.
As a result, the sector has been completely transformed. Consequently, if we want to ensure the continuity of our audiovisual sector, we must now widen the scope of the directive.
I have a number of concerns on this matter.
There continues to be an imbalance between European cinema production and imports from the United States. European films rarely reach a European Union audience outside the country where they are produced.
Six per cent of European films are shown outside their country of origin. Of the total volume of programs, 74% are fictional works imported from America and only 14% are European in origin.
As well as simply exporting programmes, major industry players are promoting the export of American thematic television channels to Europe. These are sold both to digital grouping operators and cable satellite channels.
In addition, Europe lags considerably behind the United States in the development of the digital sector.
These are the difficult issues confronting us.
This is why I believe that the only possible response is global and proactive action by the European Union. Over and above the economic and financial issues, which are clearly very important, is the key issue of our cultures, identities and the values we hold dear.
Mr President, in a previous life you also held the important position of Deputy Mayor of Madrid, so I am sure you and this House in general will be interested to know that we have a high-level deputation from Germany's cities in the public gallery.
We should offer them a warm welcome.
We agree with you.
I see that you are very well informed by a Spanish compatriot of mine.
Mrs Reding has the floor on behalf of the Commission.
Mr President, to begin with, I would like to thank Mrs Hieronymi very much for her excellent report, and for her commitment to television and cinema.
This commitment demonstrates that Parliament understands the importance of the Television without frontiers directive and its implementation.
I would like to remind honourable Members that Mrs Hieronymi' s report does not deal with the development of television in general, nor is it about cinema. It deals with the Commission' s report on the implementation of the Television without frontiers directive between 1997 and 2000.
I completely agree with those Members who deplore the state of European cinema, and are critical of both the quality of films and the industry' s economic role. I would like to remind them that last week the Commission published its report on cinema.
Mr President, I am sure Parliament will have the opportunity to begin a wide-ranging debate on the development of cinema in Europe. I wish it well.
However, the issues relating to television are slightly different.
I would like to draw your attention to the promotion of the distribution and production of television programs (as outlined in Articles 4 and 5 of the directive). It can be seen that the weighted average of European programmes broadcast by the major channels is between 53 and 81%, with the exception of one country.
It should also be noted that the majority of Member States have introduced more rigorous legislation than that provided for by the directive.
Fortunately, the situation is far better for television than for cinema.
Therefore, Mr President, I propose that we discuss the subject of cinema seriously for once in this House. It is very important that we hold this debate.
Several Members have spoken of the need to revise the directive.
This process is already under way.
It began this year with a wide-ranging consultation with the industry. The process will continue next year.
I am sure you know that we have begun three studies on different aspects of the directive on the Audiovisual sector.
We have ensured that these studies are undertaken by experts who are independent. They are therefore impartial studies, benefiting from the input of the industry and providing an objective assessment of the situation on the ground.
The consultants involved have organised workshops bringing together people from the industry, from government and politicians. Members of Parliament were also invited to these workshops.
Plans are afoot for further workshops.
Surveys of the views of interested parties will, of course, be followed by assessment and drafting work.
The findings will be brought together in a series of reports which our consultants should make available to us at the end of this year or January next year. The Commission will then begin its own consultation process with the publication of a working document, to which everyone will be invited to respond before the summer of 2002.
Mr President, Parliament will therefore have plenty of opportunity to reconsider the avenues explored in Mrs Hieronymi' s report. Most importantly, Members will also be able to examine possible future directions.
On the basis of the work undertaken, and depending on the results obtained, this will lead to an institutional debate on the directive and, if necessary, on the Commission' s proposals for a new directive, between now and the end of 2002. I would like to point out that I agree with Members on the need to reform the directive.
It is clear that the process in which we are engaged is extremely complex. The views of Parliament will be taken into account at each stage of the process.
Mrs Hieronymi' s report devotes much attention to the revision process, while also illustrating the complexity and importance of the debate.
Mr President, if I may, I would like to examine two parts of the report presented to Parliament. I wish to comment on Recital H and Article 1 e).
According to Recital H, the directive is now obsolete and applies only to generalist, free-to-air television, for which purpose it was originally created.
This is an inaccurate assessment of the situation.
The directive has a much wider scope.
It applies to broadcasting in general, including subscription and thematic broadcasters, and also to digital and analogue broadcasting.
The comments made in Recital H are therefore mistaken. They constitute a serious error as the directive does not apply to the Internet as the Internet did not exist when the directive was drafted.
Appropriate provisions should therefore be included in the revised directive.
At present, it is risky to say that the directive is obsolete for the simple reason that this could play into the hands of Member States that have not yet implemented the directive. Your rapporteur underlined this point: why implement an obsolete directive?
This would result in no action being taken and no further pressure could be applied. The final outcome would be the opposite of the wishes of Parliament.
This may also pose problems for candidate countries. They are currently experiencing considerable difficulties in transposing the acquis into their own legislation.
I shall say more about them later. Are we going to force them to implement an acquis that Parliament considers to be obsolete?
In the interests of this matter, Mr President, it is therefore extremely important to amend this part of the text.
We must also ensure that we do not give a negative impression to Member States implementing the directive, or to the candidate countries transposing the acquis. Rather, we must remind them that the directive continues to provide legal certainty to European audiovisual operators.
Some Members have already, quite rightly, highlighted this point.
Point 1) e) of the report deplores the fact that the Commission has provided insufficient information on the efforts made by the candidate countries to implement the acquis relating to the audiovisual sector, and has not stressed the need for them to increase their efforts.
I would like to remind you that the report drafted according to Article 26 of the directive deals solely with the implementation of this directive by the Member States of the European Union.
It does not deal with the adoption of the acquis by the candidate countries.
It therefore follows that there are no details on the adoption of the acquis, or of recommendations for these countries.
That said, I have some good news on this subject as the overall situation regarding the adoption of the acquis has improved since the end of 2000.
All candidate countries, except for Romania, Hungary and Turkey, have provisionally closed Chapter 20 relating to the audiovisual sector. This clearly shows that the national legislation of the great majority of the countries concerned complies with the acquis.
Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for always having supported me very strongly in my efforts to try to make progress to benefit our cultural industries, and also our cultural diversity.
I can but say to Parliament that our work has only just begun. Revising the Television without frontiers directive will be a considerable and highly complex task in which I will continue to need the resolute support of Parliament.
On the basis of past experience, I feel you will not fail me.
Thank you very much, Mrs Reding.
We are also grateful for this impetus you are giving to the revision of directives.
I am sure that the Commission and the European Parliament will work together to bring us up to date.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Question Time (Council)
The next item is Questions to the Council (B5-0333/2001).
The Council will be represented by Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, President-in-Office of the Council.
Question No 1 by (H-0689/01):
Subject: The 'Republika Srpska' What policy is the Council Presidency pursuing towards the so-called 'Republika Srpska' in Bosnia-Herzegovina, with particular regard to cooperation with the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague and to the return of expellees?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has repeatedly and consistently stressed the great importance the European Union attaches to compliance by the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process with the international obligations relating to the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia and to establishing a lasting settlement on the issue of refugees and displaced persons.
This forms part of the European Union conditions of the stabilisation and association process. The countries of the Former Yugoslavia subscribed to these conditions at the Zagreb Summit.
On 11 June the Council approved a report assessing the progress achieved by the countries of the region in relation to these conditions for European integration. The report also contained specific proposals detailing how the countries can continue working towards this aim.
On that occasion, the Council concluded that Bosnia-Herzegovina had not cooperated sufficiently with the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia, especially as regards Republika Srpska.
None of those indicted for war crimes had been arrested by the authorities of Republika Srpska.
The Council therefore ordered Bosnia-Herzegovina to take further measures to ensure that it complies in full with the Dayton-Paris agreement and collaborates fully with the International Court.
On that same occasion, the European Union expressed its view that the process of the return of refugees and displaced people throughout the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be speeded up. It was also stated that measures to create the proper conditions to enable people to return should be strengthened.
The European Union also expressed its hope to see the governments of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Republika Srpska implement all the recommendations that have been made.
The Council will ensure these matters are monitored.
This monitoring process will also allow the European Union periodically to assess compliance with the criteria established as part of the stabilisation and association process. This will enable us to assess the level of the relations established, and to decide if the level of technical and economic assistance can still be justified.
We could certainly use this tool to apply pressure on the governments of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Republika Srpska, should it prove necessary to do so.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I have two short additional questions.
First, I would like to know if Council has asked the Republica Srpska how many expellees and refugees have now returned to the Republica Srpska.
Are any figures available on this?
Secondly, I would like to ask if cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has had any repercussions on the finances of the Republica Srpska.
As regards your first question, I am unable to answer this at present but we shall check and see if more accurate figures are available.
I believe I have already given the beginning of an answer to your second question, in that the Council has clearly indicated that, if the situation does not improve, it may consider revising the funds placed at the disposal of the authorities, both in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Republika Srpska.
Question No 2 by (H-0690/01):
Subject: European regions, subsidiarity and reform of the treaties Under the weight of so many treaties (the first being Rome and the latest Nice), Europe can no longer be regarded (as far as either individuals or the public as a whole are concerned) as something 'international' ; it is now something 'internal' , not just in economic or market terms but from all points of view.
The Flemings and the Walloons cannot look upon us Basques (nor the Catalans upon the Finns, the Scots or the Welsh) as foreigners. We are all citizens and peoples who belong to Europe.
Does the Council therefore support the idea put forward some time ago in Belgium by Mr Dreze concerning the setting up within Europe of Euro-entities, that is, non-state political bodies which would be granted EU legal personality so that they could establish and maintain direct relations with the Committee of the Regions, the Commission, the Court of Justice, etc., and conclude valid agreements with other public authorities anywhere in the EU, as an extension of European law?
Does the Council not think that this issue should be specifically pursued as an initiative relating to the future of the Union, to be considered under the procedure for debating the reform of the treaties which is to be established at the Laeken European Council?
On behalf of the Council, I would remind you that the Union, in accordance with Article 6(3) of the Treaty on European Union, respects the national identity of the Member States, while Article 48 of the same Treaty stipulates that the Intergovernmental Conference has the task of establishing by mutual agreement the amendments to be included in the Treaties.
During Question Time in July, I was given the opportunity to reply to a number of questions - I believe there were ten in all - about the possible added value which an active and institutionalised participation of so-called sub-state groups would give to the debates at Union level.
I then said that the Council, without denying the incontrovertible political impact of the Committee of the Regions, was at the time unable to give a detailed response to questions concerning the role of the regional units in the Union' s structures.
The Council obviously knows the different viewpoints and is carefully following the developments around topics directly related to the balance of power within the European structures, starting with the concept of subsidiarity itself.
At this stage, on behalf of the Council, all I can do is look to the very near future, that is to say to the forthcoming meeting in Laeken, where the European Council intends to adopt a declaration which will form the basis for creating conditions to guarantee the Union' s future.
And at that meeting, I have no doubt that the tone will be set for the way in which the preparation of the IGC 2004 will have to be structured and how participation will need to be extended.
Moreover, I would like to refer you to the very thorough explanation and reply which Minister Michel gave this morning on behalf of the Council, and in which he has already given a few quite specific indications in this connection.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in the Councils of Ministers, decisions are often adopted which affect the exclusive legislative competences of historic nations such as the Basque Country, Catalonia or Scotland, of regions such as Flanders or Wallonia, of federal states such as Bavaria, Baden-Baden, Rhineland, etc.
Do you not believe that, in the event of a conflict of competences resulting from decisions adopted in the Council without the presence or acquiescence of the historic nations, regions or federal states affected, the latter constitutional entities should be empowered to present their case to the European Court of Justice, since that Court has the power under the Treaty to hear and pass judgment on these conflicts?
Do you not believe that the European Council at Laeken should include these issues in the future debate on the Union and the distribution of competences between the Union, the Member States and the other institutional bodies?
Mr President, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, although this is an issue about which I am extremely passionate, I do not feel that it would be advisable for us to resume the debate which took place in this House last July.
I did, I believe, at that point in time answer in a comprehensive manner, partly on behalf of the Council where possible, and partly in my own name.
Allow me therefore to refer you to the Minutes of that sitting in which you will find all the replies to the questions you have just asked.
Question No 3 by (H-0691/01):
Subject: Working languages in the European Patent Office On Thursday, 31 May 2001, the Council published a common position on the Community patent.
With regard to the language regime used at the European Patent Office, the text simply notes that translation costs must be limited.
It is a fundamental principle of the European Union that everybody should be able to address the institutions in any of the eleven official languages.
Does the Council agree that it must be possible for an application for a patent to be submitted to the European Patent Office in any of the eleven official languages of the EU?
If so, how does the Council guarantee that individuals and businesses may submit applications for a patent in any of the eleven official languages?
If not, how can the Council justify a position which is so at odds with the official line?
Does the Council support the Greek government' s plan to lodge a complaint against the language regime used by the Community Trade Mark Office in Alicante?
It is correct that on 31 May 2001, the Council adopted a common position on the Community patent with the aim of furthering future discussions on this subject.
With regard to the language regime used at the European Patent Office, the common position posits that it must be based on a number of principles which apply universally, including the principle of non-discrimination.
In order to curb the cost of translation, further consideration must be given to the various suggestions made in this connection, including technical translation aids, without ruling out other options a priori.
Having regard to these guidelines, the Council recently started discussing the provisions presented in the Commission proposal for a regulation on the Community patent, as well as the other solutions which have been provided for consideration by various Member States.
In any case, the honourable Member will understand that the Council is not prepared at this time to adopt a clearer position concerning this motion for a resolution, including the linguistic aspects involved, as long as the European Parliament, consulted in accordance with Article 308 of the Treaty, has not issued a recommendation on the matter.
The Council would remind the honourable MEP that the language regime of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market is established by the Regulation on the Community Trade Mark. This regulation was adopted unanimously by the Council following the agreement reached at the Conference of government representatives at the level of Heads of State and Government on 29 October 1993.
Moreover, with regard to the steps taken by the Greek government in case T-120/99, the Council is taking note of the judgment pronounced in this case by the Court of First Instance. This judgment rejects the appeal, as well as the arguments, of the requesting party against the language regime of that office.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, as we have come to expect of you, you are being extremely polite to the European Parliament.
It is very considerate of you to refer to Article 308.
We all know that Article 308 concerns a unanimous decision taken by the Council following a recommendation from Parliament.
So that is why you are waiting before adopting a clear stance.
I can understand that, but despite this, we must all realise that there appears to be only a few Member States, including Portugal, Spain, Greece, Finland and Italy, which are strongly opposed to the exclusive use of French, English and German.
All the other Member States, including my own country, unfortunately, agree to the very limited application of this language regime.
I would now like to ask you whether it would not be preferable to guarantee that the key elements of such a patent, namely the conclusions, which hardly take up two to three pages, are at least made available in all the languages.
That would considerably enhance the legal certainty of the citizens and business people in the European Union.
There would then be no need to translate twenty or thirty pages, rather only the conclusions.
I believe that we would thus bring Europe a little closer to the citizen.
Some time ago, I was given the opportunity to look into this matter more deeply.
The suggestion by Mr Staes is one of the suggestions which are currently being tabled.
President-in-Office, European industry is losing its competitive edge in regard to reaching the targets that you and the Council set for it at Lisbon by the extreme cost and time delays involved in obtaining patents in Europe.
I believe the Belgian presidency undertook to make a special effort to have the Community patent installed and implemented during its presidency.
I would be interested to know what progress is being made and whether you really are resolving the language issue in the European Patent Office.
Efforts are under way.
The Council Presidency has decided to consult each government individually and confidentially in what is called in French la procédure du confessional, in order to see whether it is possible to proceed, and with the firm desire to reach an agreement by the end of the year if at all possible.
Of course this matter does not rest with us alone.
There has to be agreement across the board, and we are working on this.
I should just like to underline Mr Staes's point on the importance of the language regime, while not ignoring the importance of the point my colleague, Mr Purvis, has made about the need for speed.
Nevertheless, the whole business of taking research on to the development stage is important.
If we are to have good research in all the universities and all the areas of the Community, it is really important for people to be able to work in their own language, even though, of course, most scientists work in English much of the time.
We take note of your statement, which is not a question.
Mr MacCormick, did you want to add anything?
My question was implicit: does the Minister agree?
Yes!
We say in Castilian 'lo bueno, si breve, dos veces bueno' [the good, if brief, is twice as good].
That is clearly the case here.
As the author is not present, Question No 4 lapses.
Question No 5 by , which has been taken over by Mr Bautista Ojeda (H-0696/01):
Subject: European Maritime Safety Agency Has the Spanish government submitted a proposal for the siting of the European Maritime Safety Agency?
Has the government suggested that the Agency be sited in Galicia, in view of Galicia's strategic location as far as Atlantic traffic is concerned and its importance as a maritime centre?
The Commission' s proposal concerning the establishment of a European Maritime Safety Agency, presented at the end of last year within the context of the 'Erika II' package, is still under consideration by the Council authorities, and the question of where this future agency is to be based remains unanswered.
To date, the Council has not received an official proposal from the Spanish government concerning the agency' s headquarters.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you have not commented because clearly, as you said, the Spanish State has still not made any formal proposal.
I would like to refer to an objective fact: Spain has always had a great maritime vocation and enjoys a privileged situation in terms of both Atlantic and Mediterranean maritime traffic, and I believe that some of those Spanish coastal territories meet all the appropriate conditions for being the location for the headquarters of this European agency.
Thank you very much, Mr Bautista Ojeda.
I would remind Members that this is Question Time and not a time to make statements or advocate certain proposals.
So in the future please try to ask questions. At least give the impression of asking a question.
Mrs Korhola has the floor for a supplementary question.
Mr President, I would like to ask the representative of the Council what the general timetable is for deciding to establish planned agencies such as the Maritime Safety Agency and, in particular, the Food Safety Agency, and is the intention to take the decision on all of them in one go or separately for each agency?
As I have pointed out, this question is still under discussion.
As you know, this question relates to decisions concerning several agencies.
On this extremely sensitive issue, as you can well imagine, we aim to reach agreement on all the unanswered questions by the end of the year, and I hope that we are successful in achieving this aim.
Question No 6 by (H-0699/01):
Subject: Illegal immigration into the European Union through Morocco What action is the Council planning to take in order to control illegal immigration into the European Union through Morocco, with a view to preventing any recurrence of the tragic events which have occurred this summer, involving the loss of human life in Community waters?
Illegal immigration into the European Union via Morocco is permanently on the Council' s agenda.
For that reason, the Council set up a High-Level Group in December 1998 to deal with asylum and migration issues. This group is responsible for drawing up action plans for a number of countries of origin of asylum seekers and/or illegal immigrants.
With a view to drafting these action plans, the group has pursued a cross-pillar approach which takes account of a number of aspects related to foreign policy, economic development and the management of migration flows.
One of the countries that has been earmarked for such an action plan is Morocco.
In October 1999, the Council adopted an action plan which provides for measures that pertain, inter alia, to the fight against illegal immigration.
The European Council of Tampere subsequently approved the action plans and expressed the wish that the measures it contains be carried out in the framework of a partnership with the countries involved.
At the initial session of the Moroccan-European Union Association Committee in Rabat in February 2001, it was agreed to set up a working party on social issues and migration.
This working party, established by decision of the Association Council of 4 April 2001, met for the first time in July and has indeed set up an informal group for migration between the European Union and Morocco.
At that meeting, three topics were flagged as priority topics for cooperation in the field of immigration.
The first topic was socio-economic cooperation and, in particular, assistance for micro- enterprises and for small and medium-sized companies.
Secondly, there was the topic of guidance concerning legal migration to the European Union and the fight against illegal immigration networks, including transit-migration from countries south of the Sahara.
For each of those topics from the High-Level Group' s action plan, a dossier will be drawn up concerning the projects to be carried out jointly.
Each dossier will contain a description of the project, an indicative description of the resources to be deployed, the budget line which will be required and a timeframe for the implementation of the project.
Each dossier will be communicated through diplomatic channels to the other party, which may then add its own proposals.
The Association Council which meets on 9 October will exchange ideas on migration and will add renewed momentum to the cooperation efforts in that field.
In the light of the particularly tragic events which have unfolded in recent weeks in Morocco and the EU countries, this is a weighty matter indeed.
Finally, Morocco will, in the person of its Minister for Justice, Mr Azziman, also be taking part in the Ministerial Conference on migration, which will take place on 16 and 17 October at the European Parliament in Brussels, an event which I will be attending as well.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I thank you for your detailed reply, but I would like to ask a couple of supplementary questions because I put this question before the tragic events of 11 September.
The Council is aware of the current security problems on our continent.
So I would firstly like to ask whether the Council is aware that we have an open border across which the European Union' s security cannot be guaranteed?
And in this regard, whether the Council is aware that every day hundreds, and every month thousands, of people are losing their lives as a result of maintaining this deceptively open border, because many of those who try to cross it die in the process?
That is to say, what can the Council do to prevent this human tragedy from continuing and to guarantee the security of the citizens of the European Union?
Mr President, I can only say to Mr Medina Ortega that we are of course aware of all the aspects, both on a human scale and in terms of security, which contribute to the gravity of the situation.
As I mentioned just now, I myself was only recently in Morocco, in Tangier, where I really saw the extent of the problem caused by illegal immigration across the strait, which in certain places really earns its name as it is barely 12 or 14 kilometres wide at its narrowest point.
Of course, we are aware of this problem and this is why all these initiatives have been implemented.
I also know from the contacts I made whilst on my trip to Morocco, which was not on behalf of the European Union but in my role as Belgian Minister, that the Moroccan authorities are also acutely aware of this problem.
They too do not watch with a light heart as members of the population embark on such perilous missions.
What does, however, occasionally upset the Moroccan authorities, and this I can understand, is that we sometimes tend to establish a little too easily a link between people from Morocco and security risks.

Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in 1998 this House adopted my proposal for a common European border police. However, by the beginning of this year neither the old Italian government nor the German government had adopted this.
I would like to ask you if the Council has made any further progress with this issue of a common European border police or if anything is planned in this area under the Belgian Presidency.
What I can tell Mr Posselt is that the question of border security concerns us intensely and that this is actually one of the priority areas on which our presidency is to take action, certainly in view of the fact that enlargement of the European Union will mean a corresponding extension of these borders.
This is therefore an extremely significant goal to which we attach a great deal of importance and progress towards which we are monitoring extremely closely.
The same sort of illegal immigration is taking place on a huge scale via Turkey to the Aegean and the Greek islands.
First, do these plans for Morocco include Turkey? Secondly, has the Council taken any action vis-à-vis Turkey, which has been granted candidate status and therefore has an additional obligation towards the European Union to guard its borders properly?
Hordes of illegal immigrants can hardly pass by unnoticed.
What has the Council done about this?
I can only repeat what I have just said.
This is an issue of very great concern to us, the more so because my country is one of the preferred countries of destination for illegal migration.
We are fully aware of the problem in all its aspects and we are working very hard on it and addressing all third parties on the subject.
Question No 7 by (H-0705/01):
Subject: Illegal conferral of Greek citizenship and a large number of violations of Community law established by a formal administrative inquiry A formal administrative inquiry held in the Greek Embassy in Moscow has uncovered not only a number of breaches of discipline, but also evidence that offences were committed with the purpose of illegally granting Greek citizenship.
In view of both the large number of 'repatriations' (some 150 000 processed by the Moscow Embassy) and the fact that significant information was concealed by officials of this Embassy, a further judicial inquiry is now being sought to shed light on this matter.
It should be pointed out that all these violations have taken place despite Greece's full participation in the Schengen acquis.
Given that in the elections in the Year 2000 votes were cast by persons who were not entitled to do so, which creates a serious political problem, will the Council say:
What is its position on the illegal naturalisations in question and the large number of illegal 'repatriations' on the basis of the Schengen acquis?
Will it bear these findings in mind, given that, according to the answer to my Written Question E-1438/01, the Greek government has not so far provided any information about the number of illegal naturalisations and 'repatriations' for 1999 and 2000?
What measures does it intend to take to prevail upon the Greek government to provide these figures and to put an end to the practices in question, to ensure transparency and to annul all the illegal naturalisations?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the questions raised by Mr Trakatellis concern the naturalisation of citizens in a Member State of the European Union and the repatriation of these citizens.
Mention is made of suspicions surrounding practices which are currently the subject of an inquiry that the public prosecutor has been asked to carry out.
Lastly, the question conjures up a presumed link between these practices and the Schengen Agreements.
I must point out that the Council is not qualified to comment on the circumstances in which Member States may or may not grant citizenship. In fact, naturalisation policy falls within the competence of the Member States.
Therefore, in the case in question, the application of these provisions falls within the competence of the Greek government, which Mr Trakatellis should address directly for the answers to the questions he has raised.
Finally, the Council feels that, for details of immigration and statistics concerning the number of naturalisations, Mr Trakatellis could usefully refer to the reply given to him in July by the Commission in response to question E-1438/01 concerning the years prior to that mentioned here and ask the Commission to provide him with the figures for 1999 and 2000 as soon as these are available.
Thank you for your reply.
I shall take your advice as regards the figures for 1999 and 2000 which, I should point out, the Commission was unable to give me even yesterday because it did not yet have them, even though it is 2001 and the Member States naturally have a duty under the Schengen Agreement.
I should like to ask you specifically: if and insofar as a Member State naturalises a person or persons, can that person, once they have obtained a passport or an identity card from the Member State, live anywhere in the European Union?
If it later emerges that they should not have been naturalised, is the Member State which naturalised them obliged to pass this information on to the other Member States so that the person who has no right to live in the European Union can be located?
And if it has this duty towards Europol and the other Member States, my question is this: has the Greek government provided this information?
We have proof that there are people who have obtained Greek nationality but were not entitled to do so.
I can only repeat what I have just said.
The granting of nationality is an exclusive competence of the Member States.
That does not answer my question.
I do not dispute the fact that nationality is granted by the Member States, my question is: what happens when it should not have been granted and the person is living in another Member State?
How will that person later be located?
What practical method do we have for locating him or her?

Again, as the granting of nationality falls within the competence of the Member States, it is up to the judiciary of the Member State concerned to decide whether the obtaining of nationality by illegal means, if proven, warrants any given action.
That is a matter for the Member State.
It is not for the Council or the European Union to decide what should happen.
If one holds a passport, one can use it.
Question No 8 by (H-0715/01):
Subject: The EU's most federalist country According to press reports, the Belgian Prime Minister, Guy Verhofstadt, has called Finland Europe' s most federalist country.
Does the representative of the country holding the presidency stand by this definition, and on what measure of familiarity with Finnish affairs can it possibly be based?
Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, I invite you to answer the question by Mr Esko Olavi Seppänen.
I believe that it refers to Finland.
I am sorry I missed that one.
I understand quite a lot of Spanish but not everything.
Sometimes I think I am fortunate not to understand everything.
I thank the honourable Member for his question, but as the quoted statements were not made by Prime Minister Verhofstadt in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, it is difficult for me to comment on them on behalf of the Council, which I represent here today.

Mr President, Minister, when Sweden held the presidency, the custom was that if the Minister did not answer the question asked him or her in this session the possibility of providing a written reply also existed.
I remember Sweden' s European Minister very often replying in writing to questions on which he or she, as President-in-Office of the Council, did not want to take a stand.
I would therefore ask Belgium' s representative if she could continue the policy adopted by Sweden in this matter and reply to me in writing, in her capacity as Belgian Minister, stating the answer to this question, and also which country Belgium considers to be the most federalist state in Europe; the totally unfounded claim has been put forward that this country would be Finland.
This claim was made by the Belgian Prime Minister, at a press conference during the Belgian presidential term, to be exact.
I can only repeat what I said.
The statement was made by Mr Verhofstadt in his capacity as Prime Minister of Belgium, not as President-in-Office of the Council.
Therefore I cannot, on behalf of the Council, comment on those statements.
Question No 9 by (H-0717/01):
Subject: Cooperation agreement with Iran and legislative reforms in respect of women With reference to the political dialogue between the European Union and Iran and to the most recent meeting (in September) of the Troika in Tehran, will such cooperation and dialogue lead to any improvement in the legal situation of Iranian women?
What progress is expected to be made?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the main aim of the European Union's policy towards Iran is to encourage internal reforms in that country.
The issue of human rights is an important point in the political dialogue with Iran.
Any future trade and cooperation agreement with this country must also include human rights clauses.
During the recent round of political dialogue which took place in Tehran on 3 September, the European Union raised the topic of human rights along with the issues of judicial reforms and democratic rights, including freedom of expression and the press, the death penalty and recent cases involving the stoning of women.
As regards the situation of Iranian women, improvement not only of their legal status but also of the concrete reality of their situation is a specific aim of the dialogue.
The European Union noted with interest the efforts of the Iranian government and Parliament to introduce new legislation geared towards women and girls.
I am referring, for example, to the draft law designed to raise the legal age of marriage for girls to 15 and to the draft law giving women the right to unconditional divorce.
Unfortunately, the Council can, to date, only regret that these efforts have still not come to anything due to opposition from other Iranian bodies, most notably the Council of Guardians.
At the last session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, the European Union took the initiative of tabling a resolution on the human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
The Swedish Presidency submitted a draft resolution on behalf of the European Union at this session.
This resolution was adopted on 20 April this year.
The Commission on Human Rights, according to the terms of this resolution, welcomes the improvement seen in the area of women' s education and health and their participation in democratic life in the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as the efforts made to improve the situation of women and girls, particularly by means of laws designed to raise the legal age of marriage and lift the ban barring unmarried women from studying abroad.
However, the Commission is also gravely concerned by the fact that these drafts have yet to be enacted in law. Enactment would be a way of putting an end to the systematic discrimination against women and girls in legislation and in practice and a way of removing the obstacles preventing women and girls from exercising their fundamental rights fully and equally.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for your reply, which I believe offers hope in an area in which there are serious difficulties.
I would like to ask the Council whether it would be in favour of carrying out monitoring, even of agreeing a timetable on the progress made in relation to the situation of women in terms of laws, because the Council is aware, like us, that if these improvements are not introduced into laws, they will not be consolidated.
I therefore believe that the Council is working very seriously and in agreement with the European Parliament in this area, but does the Council not believe that at some point it would be good to agree a timetable for introducing this progress and these improvements into laws since that is the only way to consolidate them?
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I would like to reply by saying that you have of course made an interesting suggestion.
I believe that the main thing as regards the development of the situation is that the political dialogue now seems to be well under way and, moreover, in a serious fashion, and I believe that we must all, each at our own level, endeavour to keep this dialogue going, to broaden it and, above all, to continue and maintain it in order to encourage those among the authorities who are working for progress to continue to make headway in this direction.
Question No 10 by (H-0719/01):
Subject: Repatriating Mobotu funds While welcoming the Belgian law allowing individuals to seek the arrest of suspected war criminals visiting Belgium, would the President-in-Office of the Council indicate who had been tried for the crimes committed in the former Congo and will he indicate what measures have been taken to repatriate funds lodged in Belgian and other banks in the name of the former 'President' Mobotu of Zaire and the steps that have been taken in order to confiscate former family assets in Brussels?
The response is as follows : the question that was put by the honourable MEP falls outside of the Council' s competence.
The Belgian Presidency has probably been the best presidency I have witnessed in the 18 years I have been a Member of this House.
It is making an impact with the citizens.
My question does not just refer to the Mobotu funds that are spread throughout Europe and lying dormant in banks or are perhaps being used by undesirable types.
It also deals with the law in Belgium which apparently allows the arrest of people suspected of war crimes.
There was the recent case of the Israeli Prime Minister being threatened with legal action.
My question also relates to the historical responsibility of the European Union, including the presidency, for colonialism and for the atrocities committed in various states.
For instance, would the President-in-Office tell me who so far has been charged with complicity in the murder of President Lumumba and the installation of the psychopath Mobotu, which resulted in great pain for the former colony of the Congo?
I would like to tell the honourable Member that, when I told him his questions concerned matters not within the competence of the Council, I was referring to his questions as a whole.
Questions concerning the Belgian government should be addressed to the latter.
I am here to represent the Presidency of the Council of the entire European Union, as you very well know.
(Protests from Mr Andrews)
The reply of the President-in-Office is clear.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you have the floor if you wish.
That is rather a personal point.
I am not afraid to answer but this morning Minister Michel was here.
He spoke at length about the way the Durban Conference went.
If you had questions about your and my and other people's colonial past, then that was the moment to ask them, to make your remarks and to formulate your criticisms.
Question No 11 by (H-0720/01):
Subject: Freedom of movement for EU citizens and legality of the Italian government's actions In the wake of the discussions on the incidents which took place before and after the G8 Summit in Genoa, some questions remain as to how the Council characterises and assesses the Italian government's actions from a strictly legal point of view.
The Italian government suspended the Schengen Agreement.
Does the Council believe that this suspension was sufficiently justified and complied with the provisions of the Schengen Agreement itself?
If the Schengen Agreement has been suspended, what legal regime applies, in the Council's view, with regard to travel by citizens of EU Member States to another Member State which has suspended application of the Schengen Agreement?
Do the provisions of the EU Treaty concerning freedom of movement also cease to apply?
In other words, does the Italian government have the right to ban hundreds of Greek citizens who travelled to Italy (in order to demonstrate in Genoa) from disembarking from their ship at the port of Ancona without even checking their passports and without any explanation?
Question No 12 by (H-0724/01):
Subject: Registration in the SIS Large-scale demonstrations and major clashes between certain groups of demonstrators and the police occurred in connection with the European Council meeting in Gothenburg and the G8 meeting in Genoa.
In both Gothenburg and Genoa, the police used excessive force and abusive tactics, including assaults on and the arbitrary arrest and improper treatment of non-violent demonstrators.
Most of those arrested during the two demonstrations have since not been charged with any offence.
Can the Council guarantee that demonstrators who were arrested and identified, but are not suspected of any criminal offence, will not be registered in the SIS?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the questions raised by Messrs Papayannakis and Sjöstedt concern, on the one hand, the conditions surrounding the reinstatement of internal border controls in a Member State which applies the Schengen acquis and, on the other hand, the conditions for the entry of an alert in the 'Schengen Information System' in relation to the events at the G8 meeting in Genoa.
As regards the first point, this situation does not in fact correspond to what the two Members have referred to in their question as, and I quote, "an abolition of the validity of the Schengen Convention" .
The reinstatement of border controls is a measure which is explicitly laid down in Article 2 item 2 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement.
And this article, along with the method of applying this article adopted in 1995 by the governments of those Member States applying the Schengen acquis, is part of the Schengen acquis, incorporated into European Union law.
The Italian authorities felt that public order or national security required that national border checks appropriate to the situation be carried out at internal borders for the duration of the G8 Summit in Genoa, more specifically from 14 to 21 July 2001.
This was admittedly an exceptional measure, but a measure that other Member States have used in the past during political or sporting events or during events which could have involved a threat to public order.
Turning now to the second point, I refer the two Members to the answer that we gave on the same subject at the June 2001 part-session, namely that the Council is not qualified to answer the question as to whether an alert was issued in the 'Schengen Information System' for certain individuals involved in these events. Entry of an alert in the SIS actually falls within the competence of the Member States.
Let me point out that, according to Article 94 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, and I quote: 'The Schengen Information System shall contain only the categories of data which are supplied by each of the Contracting Parties, as required for the purposes laid down in Articles 95 to 100.
The Contracting Party issuing an alert shall determine whether the case is important enough to warrant entry of the alert in the Schengen Information System.
Furthermore, Article 104 stipulates that, and I quote: 'Alerts shall be governed by the national law of the Contracting Party issuing the alert unless more stringent conditions are laid down in this Convention' .
Finally, may I remind Mr Sjöstedt that the Schengen acquis was published in Official Gazette L 239 on 22 September 2000.
Mr President, I would like to speak in French, if I may, so that I can make myself understood more easily.
Thank you for your answer, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, and for the information that you gave.
I knew the details regarding the Schengen Agreement but it is useful to have confirmation of them.
My first point, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, is that I am not talking about abolition.
Your translation services have made a mistake - I am talking about suspension.
This is a different concept altogether and this is the correct word.
I sincerely apologise for writing in Greek.
My second point, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, is that you spoke of the reinstatement of checks. In the case that I mention in my question, however, involving the 150 young people from Greece who were banned before they even left their ship in the port of Ancona, they did not undergo any checks at all.
That is why I put to you the following question - when the Schengen Agreement is suspended, which legal status is applicable?
I would guess that it is the status laid down generally by the treaty, in other words, free movement with passport control.
The passports of the Greek citizens were not checked, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck.
This, forgive me for saying so, is totally illegal, it is deplorable and what is more, this is a matter for the European courts.
And, in my view, it is a matter for you, the Council or the Commission.
Once again, Mr Papayannakis, I can only repeat what I said.
I apologise if there has been a mistake in translation.
You have rectified the situation.
As for your other points, I have taken note of the comments that you made and I shall pass these on.
I think it is incredibly serious that the Council of Ministers is unable to answer the question of whether people who are neither suspected of a crime nor have committed a crime are registered in the EU data system, SIS.
The issue is that of whether the SIS can fulfil the most fundamental requirements of the rule of law.
I nonetheless interpret the Council' s reply as indicating that it is possible for a Member State, unsupervised, to choose to place a person on the SIS register without the person in question being suspected of, or convicted of, a crime, but with him or her having simply taken part in a demonstration and been identified by the police.
This is entirely unacceptable in such cases and in breach of normal legal practice.
Perhaps you can confirm that if a state registers someone who has not committed a crime, then that person will remain on the SIS register, and it will be possible to obtain information about the fact when the person concerned passes external border controls and when an internal Schengen check is carried out.
The only thing I can confirm is that it is the responsibility of the Member States to enter personal data into the Schengen Information System.
Under the Convention they are obliged to see to it that the importance of the situation justifies any such input into the system.
This is, then, the responsibility of the Member States.
This is a genuine point of order, Mr President.
In her answer, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck stated that she has taken my question into account and that she will pass it on.
Does that mean that I will, at a later date, at some point receive a reply?
What I said was that we shall look into your questions in greater detail beforehand, and if it appears that they refer to matters that fall within the Council' s remit, we will be able to give you an answer.
If it appears, however, that one or more Member States are solely responsible for the issue as a whole, I shall be unable to give you an answer on behalf of the Council.
Thank you very much, Madam President-in-Office of the Council.
The President-in-Office has replied and, depending on what happens, Mr Papayannakis will have the appropriate mechanisms to address the Council.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 13 and 14 will be taken together.
Question No 13 by (H-0721/01):
Subject: Priorities for the UN General Assembly Special Session on Children On 5 July 2001, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the European Union's positions in the UNGA Special Session on Children, which is being held at the end of September.
In its resolution, Parliament called on the Council to report to it on EU efforts and priorities for the Special Session and on EU actions during the Special Session.
Where is that report?
In what way has the Council taken account of Parliament's call for support for the view that the family is the fundamental unit of society and that the theme of the Session 'A World Fit for Children' has to be at the same time 'A World Fit for Families'?
Question No 14 by (H-0722/01):
Subject: EU position on the UN World Summit for Children As it was voted on 5 July 2001, the resolution on the EU position for the UNGASS for Children states that 'the Family is the fundamental unit of society and holds the primary responsibility for the protection, upbringing and development of children'.
Can the Council inform us why the EU delegation at the UN promotes the term, 'the Family in its various forms' as the fundamental unit of society, and who agreed this re-interpretation since the July vote?
Also, in the light of the fact that the term 'reproductive health services' has been publicly defined at the UN as including abortion, can the Council explain why the EU delegation at the UN supports 'universally accessible health care and services, including sexual and reproductive health' and how this can be reconciled with the Council's answer of 14 March 2001 in which it states that 'on the specific issue of abortion, the Council recalls that national abortion legislation does not fall under Community competence'.
First of all, I would remind you that the European Union as such has no official status with, nor is it accredited to the United Nations.
Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union stipulates that Member States shall coordinate their action in international organisations and at international conferences and that they shall uphold the EU' s common positions.
The EU' s common positions, also on matters which concern the questions put by the honourable Members, are coordinated and agreed upon in the framework of the common foreign and security policy and require unanimity from all EU Member States.
As soon as an EU position has been adopted by the Member States, it is included in the negotiating process with other members of the United Nations community.
Since it is the international community' s wish to reach consensus on the draft documents for the United Nations Special Assembly on children, the respective positions and wordings pertaining to the draft documents are the subject of constant negotiation and adaptation with a view to reaching agreement on the draft action plan which might receive full UN backing.
In addition, reference is once again made to Article 152(5) of the Treaty which stipulates that "Community action in the field of public health shall fully respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care."
With regard to the concepts 'family' and 'reproductive health care' , the Member States have drawn on the language that was agreed upon during several previous UN world conferences, namely those of Cairo, Beijing and Copenhagen.
The Special Session on Children has, as a result of the terrorist attacks in the United States, been put on the back-burner.
The presidency will report to the European Parliament on the European Union' s efforts and priorities within the context of regular information on the development of the common foreign and security policy, as enshrined in Article 21 of the Treaty.
However, I can inform you now that the European Union, during preparations of this special session, has expressed the resolve to do everything in its power to bring about a world which really pays attention to children.
Our actions in this field must be based on the International Convention on the Rights of the Child.
It remains the reference instrument par excellence.
The countries that have ratified the Convention - and I am referring to the International Convention on the Rights of the Child - must implement it in full, and those countries that have not yet ratified it, should do so as a matter of urgency.
The document that will be approved by the special General Assembly must be geared towards action and must pursue the following objectives.
First of all, we must invest in our children.
Forgive me for using an economic term.
A great deal of attention and care must be devoted to sound upbringing, one that is worthy of children, to their health, their well-being and their development, and resources must be set aside for that purpose.
In addition, children must be protected.
They must be protected from the effects of conflicts, abuse, violence and all forms of discrimination, exploitation, conscription into the armed forces, as well as from anti-personnel mines, epidemics and HIV/AIDS, in particular.
These are all scourges which affect them particularly cruelly.
Finally, children must also be heard, and they must be able to take part in the decisions that affect them.
Children must indeed be considered key figures in the mapping out of the course of their own development.
I would like to express my thanks for the reply, but I should nonetheless like to say that, in all the important comments made towards the end of your reply, you did not actually mention the family among those initiatives you emphasised as being in the best interests of the child.
Was this pure coincidence?
In Paragraph 1 of the European Parliament resolution of 5 July 2001 on the EU positions at the UN General Assembly Special Session on Children, we state the following: 'family is the fundamental unit of society and holds the primary responsibility for the protection, upbringing and development of children' .
In other words, it says 'family' , not 'family in its various forms' .
How do you interpret the position of the European Parliament, and how do you value a mother and a father supporting their children in their development?
Why has the EU acted in a way which means that the concept of family has in fact been changed?
That is a very philosophical question, Mr Sacrédeus. I am not going to interpret what you have said, but that is the impression I have as President.
We must ask specific questions, but I accept your question and the President-in-Office will answer it.
If you wish to add anything, you have the floor.
That is your own assessment, Mr President.
You are Vice-President for me and all the other Members too.
I asked specific questions about the concept of family.
The last time I asked a question too, you also chose to believe that I was presenting philosophical questions and comments.
I asked the Belgian Presidency specific questions. I request that you, as a competent Vice-President, show respect for all Members, including Swedish Christian Democrats.
I am assuming that this will be the last time you offend a Member in this way.
Philosophy and ethics are important issues even for you.
Mr Sacrédeus, I have enormous respect for all Members.
I have accepted your question.
But as legal administrator for this Question Time, sometimes I can and must express the opinion that they are very general.
Your question is in order and I have not criticised it at all.
I have said that it seems very general, but the President-in-Office will reply to it.
There is no problem.
Please be assured that the Christian Democrats warrant my absolute respect.
Mr President, if I may, I shall answer all three at the same time.
Two other Members also wanted to speak.
I can answer all three together, or do I have to answer each question individually?
We usually reply question by question.
Furthermore, for Mr Sacrédeus' s benefit, it is better that you reply to him directly.
Unless the interpreters have omitted some of what I said, which would surprise me, I think that I have given a general answer.
My personal views on the family are of no relevance at all to the debate that we are having.
I have the greatest respect for the family, but that has no relevance to the debate underway here.
The question is what is the position of Member States, since it is the Member States who must unanimously adopt and define their position regarding the work of the United Nations General Assembly on Children.
I have given you some information on this issue.
I stated that Member States are using the same terminology as that used at the United Nations global conferences, in other words at the conferences in Cairo, Peking and Copenhagen.
This is a political indication of the way in which Member States are working to define a unanimous position concerning the United Nations conference on Children.
I thank the President-in-Office for her answer.
It took a great deal of time to establish how Parliament's position would be presented at the UN Special Session.
A general meeting was held where candidate countries and, indeed, the Commissioner were present.
He made the very concrete statement that the child cannot be dealt with in isolation but in the context of the family and community.
We took a general vote and there was an overwhelming desire to make a special reference to the child in the context of the family.
We then debated a proposed position for Parliament, which was voted on in this Chamber.
It is our responsibility therefore to ensure that the wishes, not just of Parliament but also of the candidate countries who had travelled here and of the Member State representatives who came, concerning the position on the family are accurately presented, otherwise our time has been wasted.
As the UN definition of reproductive health services is so much in conflict with our position as stated in the Treaties - in particular with the protocol of my country - does the Council intend to challenge this publicly stated definition or to change the definition of reproductive health services within the institutions of the EU?
Whatever our personal feelings on this or other subjects, we need to work within the existing legal frameworks.
I started my answer by reminding you that the European Union as such is not a member of the United Nations and enjoys no special status in its relations with the United Nations.
I reminded you further that the Member States have undertaken to coordinate their positions in the international organisations of which they are members or the international fora in which they act or participate.
This is the legal framework in which such conferences are prepared.
Thus the European Parliament resolution is certainly of interest to the different Member States, but cannot possibly - with all due respect - be considered binding on them.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you gave the issue of public health a special mention.
I would be interested to know how you see the division of responsibilities between the United Nations and the World Health Organisation.
What are your priorities here?
I apologise for not being able to speak German well enough to be able to give you an answer in German, especially using specialised vocabulary, but I do understand it.
The questions regarding the structure of the various international - even world-wide - institutions are all very interesting, but will lead us nowhere.
Moreover, the Council, as it stands, has no position on this subject that I could communicate to you on its behalf.
I can express my personal views, which may be of interest to you, but they will not make the slightest difference because they do not convey the position of the Council.
My personal view is that it is high time for all the international institutions, wherever they are based, to cooperate more closely and to coordinate their respective policies more effectively than they have done so far.
I am not going to make any judgment. I am simply going to ask you, when you have time, to reread Annex II (point A: Guidelines) in relation to the procedure for Question Time laid down in Rule 43.
Simply that: we should all read it when we have time.
As the author is not present, Question No 15 lapses.
Question No 16 by (H-0727/01):
Subject: Further judgments of the European Court of Human Rights against Turkey in the case of Leyla Zana and three other Members of Parliament Ruling on 17 July 2001 in cases 29900/96 - 29903/96, the European Court of Human Rights fined Turkey 110 000 dollars for continuing to detain the Sacharov prize-winner Leyla Zana and three other Members of Parliament in Turkish prisons.
In view of the fact that Turkey systematically ignores the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, can the Council provide evidence that Turkey intends to comply with the above judgments of the Court?
Can the Council provide a list of ECHR judgments which Turkey continues to ignore?
What measures does it intend to take?
The Council would like to point out to the honourable Member that the judgments quoted by him have been passed by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
In other words, the Court established by the Council of Europe and not by the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg.
At the moment, the European Union has no specific reason to believe that Turkey will not be falling in with the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in this instance.
On a wider scale, neither does the European Union have a list of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights with which Turkey is said to have failed to conform.
The Council of the European Union would remind you that it has no authority whatsoever to implement the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.
However, on behalf of the Council, I would like to emphasise that the Union, particularly within the framework of the strengthened dialogue with Turkey, seizes every opportunity to stress the obligation resting on that country to observe all international agreements it has entered into; particularly in the field of human rights, obviously including the decisions by the European Court of Human Rights.
Within the framework of the partnership for the accession of Turkey, the European Union has stipulated that Turkey must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and guarantee that it will ensure that these are also translated into practice.
The Council will follow Turkey' s progress from close range once the Commission has submitted its report on this matter.
I can therefore only reiterate that the Council does not have a list of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights which are said to have been ignored by Turkey.
I understand how tired the representative of the Council must be, she has been here since this morning, she has intervened on numerous issues, and I can only ascribe her disdain for the European Court of Human Rights to that.
Why else would a representative of the Council of Ministers of the European Union say that we have no knowledge of the rulings by the European Court of Human Rights, especially here in Strasbourg?
It is a disgrace, an absolute disgrace!
Besides, the European Parliament, in its recent resolutions on Turkey, has called on Turkey, among other things, to respect the rulings and to obey the rulings of the European Court.
But that is by the by.
My question concerns Leyla Zanna.
A Sacharov prizewinner, one of us.
You are a member of the Belgian Parliament.
She is a member of the Turkish national assembly.
She is a woman, she is your age and she is in prison.
Can we just ignore this issue in a candidate country, is this our response?
Perhaps simultaneous interpretation problems are to blame here.
I did not say that we do not have the list of European Court rulings; I said that we do not have a list of the rulings which Turkey may have failed to observe.
That is what I said, and it is different.
I was in the former Chamber when the prize was awarded to Mrs Zana and as a Member of this Parliament I associated myself with many of the positions taken by this Parliament in respect of Turkey.
You are well aware that the Council's position on Turkey is very clear.
We have made that position clear to Turkey repeatedly and will continue to do so.
The Minister has pointed out that this is a court of the Council of Europe, not a court of the European Union.
However, we are all well aware of the relations between the European Parliament and the supreme court of the Council of Europe.
Secondly, she said, and she repeated, that she does not have a list of the Court rulings which Turkey may have failed to observe.
Apart from the rulings on Leyla Zana and the other three Members of Parliament in prison, there is the famous ruling on Titina Loizidou, the Greek Cypriot still waiting for Turkey to pay the compensation awarded to her in a ruling by the supreme court, which Turkey has provocatively said it has no intention of observing.
I repeat I am surprised because the Minister has served as a Member of the European Parliament and as a member of her national parliament and she should at least have thought about it and if she did not have a list, she had all the time in the world to ask for one rather than coming here today, if I may say so, without having done her homework.
I sometimes wonder whether the tone adopted by some of the Members has anything to do with my sex, age or something else.
I have been very clear in my answers.
There is a distinction between the Court of Human Rights and our own Court of Justice in Luxembourg, as you very well know.
We hold Turkey to its responsibility of respecting all the international obligations that country has undertaken and among them, of course, is the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights.
This is one of the permanent elements of the political dialogue we are having with Turkey.
We are doing our homework.
It might not always produce the results that you would like to see or produce them as quickly as you would like, but we are doing our homework.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of Parliament, I thank you for your dedication this evening and all the answers you have given us.
We like some of your answers more than others, but we are grateful for your dedication.
As the time allotted to questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 17 to 23, 25 and 26 will be replied to in writing.
Question No 24 by Mr Van Lancker is not admissible since it refers to an item included on the agenda for the present part-session.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Strengthening economic policy coordination within the euro area - Contribution of public finances to growth and employment
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
A5-0307/2001 by Mrs Berès on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Commission communication on strengthening economic policy coordination within the euro area;
A5-0306/2001 by Mrs Peijs on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Commission communication to the Council and Parliament on the contribution of public finances to growth and employment: improving quality and sustainability (COM(2000) 846 - C5-0172/2001 - 2001/2082(COS)).
Mr President, before I give my comments as rapporteur, I would like to make an objection and ask you to refer it to the Conference of Presidents.
In my view, it is absurd to have this debate now, when we had the debate on the Stability Pact this afternoon, and in the meantime, the Conference of Presidents thought it would be worthwhile to find time for a debate on television without frontiers.
This does not help to make our work more coherent.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are about to debate has come at a crucial moment.
On 21 September 2001, the European Council acknowledged the importance of the subjects we discuss and assisted us by requesting, for the first time, that the Commission prepare a recommendation on the economic situation of the euro area following the events of 11 September.
Some people might believe that it has been easier to organise economic policy coordination during a period of growth.
This was not intentional, even though there have been many fortunate coincidences, such as tax cuts in various Member States, which we can now welcome.
Today, however, we are faced with genuine external shocks, even though the consequences of the slowdown in the United States were already challenging us on the basis of our growth, economic policy coordination is becoming even more difficult, and even more necessary, because, at the other end of the spectrum, European policy now amounts to monetary policy and also because Mr Duisenberg, in the wake of the events of 11 September, made a commitment with his US counterpart to coordinate economic areas.
As the changeover to euro notes and coins draws near, we must make economic and monetary union manage on its own two feet.
This is what we invited the Commission to do with its communication, which we welcome.
A great deal has already been done and there is still a great deal to do.
Member States must conduct their policy in a responsible and autonomous manner.
Coordination, however, must help to make this policy as consistent as possible and mutually beneficial.
This is what the changeover to the euro represents.
The report that I am commending to Parliament echoes the Commission communication and indicates a number of options, which we believe are essential.
First of all, this coordination depends on the Eurogroup and its president, who, we must be able to believe, speaks on behalf of the whole group.
Next, the Commission must have an essential role but it cannot approach this as if it were one of its, say, conventional areas of competence.
In some ways, this role is more political, in which the Commission must display its ability to make innovative proposals, to develop medium-term prospects.
And the European Parliament must be the public forum for debate on economic policy coordination.
In order to achieve this, three courses of action are needed.
First of all, we need indicators, harmonised statistics and barometers for the euro area.
An economic policy for the euro area is impossible unless we have good instruments to navigate by.
I am also aware that some Member States are having a debate on the cost-effectiveness of the indicators.
We are clearly in favour of spending a small amount of money so that the indicators can be more effective.
In our view, the second crucial point is the exchange of information, on which Eurogroup members have made a start.
We believe it is essential to go further, to take advantage of everything that could enable peer evaluation, with the option of asking the Commission to carry out an assessment of the impact of measures proposed by a Member State as part of its budgetary, fiscal or structural policy.
Lastly, Mr President, we must improve the quality and the coherence of all aspects of the debate.
Economic policy coordination in the national parliaments must be integrated.
This means integrating the broad economic policy guidelines into the debate on national budgets.
It also means that a national debate must be based on the stability programmes.
This also means that before we discuss the broad economic policy guidelines in the European Parliament, we want to hear the views of our colleagues in the national parliaments.
I shall conclude, Mr President, by saying that this also means we hope to see the President of the Eurogroup come before the relevant parliamentary committee as often as is necessary.
Mr President, the Commission Communication on public finances is now, some time after its publication, particularly topical.
The economy is slowing down, partly of its own accord, partly through laxity on the part of major Member States, and on top of this there are the after-effects of the tragic events of 11 September.
These things have again, for the first time in a while, put pressure on the public finances of the Member States.
History has taught us that considerable public expenditure can lead to major inefficiency, to too high a claim on the capital market and to excessive taxation, and very rarely to higher employment.
All these aspects can seriously hinder the healthy development of the private sector and consequently hamper growth in employment grounded in supply and demand.
Almost ten years ago, the European Heads of State and Government acknowledged this development, and agreed in Maastricht to work on a sustainable budgetary position.
If Member States join together in a large monetary zone, albeit with coordination of economic policy, but without real political union, they must adhere to their agreements.
Thanks to instruments made available to the ECB, the latter can influence the stability of prices and, along with this, the living conditions of people in the Euro area.
Further to a discussion in the Preparatory Committee, I would once again like to underline that price stability, along with controlled inflation, contributes to a sustained purchasing power at the bottom of the wage structure and to an incentive to return to work.
Price stability prevents the purchasing power of those of pensionable age from being eroded.
It also ensures that wage increases within the labour market actually translate into more financial scope for families in Europe, and do not merely enable people to keep up with price increases, as is the case in my own country.
Some countries give tax cuts with one hand and take them back, in the form of VAT hikes and higher local taxes, with the other.
This instils in the public a sense of distrust in politics.
And the instruction to the Central Bank to monitor prices is the most effective social measure I can remember for a good few years.
In addition to the Central Bank' s pursuit of stability, the Member States' investment and budgetary policy is critical to the living and working conditions of Europeans and to confidence in the single currency.
According to President Duisenberg, the watering down of the budgetary objectives is of huge concern.
You yourself, Commissioner, called key countries including Germany, France, Italy and Portugal to account and reminded them of their duties.
And in those same countries, the idea of extending the Stability Pact is being mooted.
Let one thing be clear, however: the financial markets are closely watching the Member States in terms of how they are dealing with their budgets in a declining economy.
The countries which did nothing when it was economically possible, are now, of course, struggling the most to observe the Stability Pact.
Needless to say, it is unrealistic to expect that they will now increase taxes or curb spending, but I consider an increase in spending to be an irresponsible burden in the face of an uncertain future.
Our generation must pay for its own bills, rather than pass them on to the next.
The current situation is a test of how sound the euro system actually is, and it is patently clear to the financial market that the public budgets are the weak link in the entire euro cycle.
Governments must not be allowed to think that the euro belongs to all of us but that their budgets are purely a national matter.
Furthermore, nobody has managed to explain to me what the use is of a Stability Pact which only applies to buoyant times.
It is precisely in an economy that is slowing down that it is important to translate agreements into practice.
The European Commission devotes an important proportion of its communication to future demographic developments.
It is a crucial component, because an ageing population will have a great impact on future budgetary positions.
And an ageing population is another reason to look after the Stability Pact.
It will also mean that we will be obliged to work much more on lifelong learning in order to sustain our own professional profile. What is more, people will probably need to work well beyond the age of fifty-seven and a half, as is now mostly the case, for example in the Netherlands.
In my report, I am asking for an individual path to be sketched for every Member State, so that the political tendency to indulge in short-term thinking will not prejudice the just pension and care expectations of people.
Mr President, in my report, it is certainly not my intention to create the impression that public investments should not be allowed, but in the Stability Pact, 60% of the GDP has already been earmarked to meet the needs for public investments.
That offers ample scope for in-depth investment in education, R&D and healthcare.
Finally, I would like to note that I am pleased that constructive consultation with the Group of the Party of European Socialists was possible in order to come to an acceptable compromise.
Tomorrow, I will ask you whether it is possible to table an oral compromise amendment during the vote.
Mr President, given that this is a joint debate, I will point out that my mandate is restricted to the report by Mrs Peijs.
Mr President, it is customary for draftspeople of the opinion to congratulate the rapporteur of the committee responsible, to express their agreement and satisfaction, and to try to highlight their contributions and/or to at least expand on a few points.
Unfortunately, I will not be able to continue that practice today.
On behalf of the Committee on Budgets, which I have the honour of representing institutionally, I must express the profound disappointment of my committee at the treatment by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of our amendments, and please do not interpret this as in any way a personal opinion.
The Committee on Budgets adopted its opinion unanimously while I was absent through illness.
I was not even there at the final moment to defend my proposals and the opinion was therefore adopted without interference.
There was not a single vote against and there was therefore no distinction of a party political nature.
This is in no way a party political issue for us.
The majority of members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, however, has rejected our amendments en masse. Unless I am mistaken, not a single one of our amendments has warranted the approval of that majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
And we in the Committee on Budgets have the feeling, Mr President, that constructive and purely institutional contributions have been thoroughly spurned and scorned.
To be frank, we can find no explanation for this systematic negative vote.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is true that the Commission document which is the basis of our discussion focused, shall we say, on national budgets.
But when the Committee on Budgets added the Community dimension, the Commission, in particular the Commissioner present, thanked us for it and expressed its appreciation of this widening of the perspective of the Communication.
Well, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has refused to open its eyes to this additional dimension.
Why?
Why does the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs deny that the European Union' s meagre budget, 1.07% of Community GDP, has been applied just as rigorously as that of the Member States?
By rejecting Amendment No 7, this is what they have done.
It is also difficult for we budgeteers in this House to understand why, two days from the first reading of the 2001 budget, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs denies, by rejecting Amendments Nos 5 and 6, the multiplier effect of Community expenditure and the fact that it frequently acts as an example for national, regional and local authorities.
If that is the economic thinking of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the coherent thing for it to do would be to withdraw all the amendments it has presented to the draft budget.
That would be the most logical thing for it to do.
Ladies and gentlemen, 90 days from the physical introduction of the euro, any inkling of fiscal policy in relation to the Community budget is being sidestepped.
From the point of view of the Committee on Budgets, the obvious thing to do would be to gradually strengthen the European budget and go beyond mere - necessary, but mere - coordination of the economic policies of the Member States.
Some day, just as we now have a 'Mr' CFSP, we are convinced that we will need a 'Mrs' Euro, perhaps Mrs Peijs herself, and a greater European budget, in exchange for a reduction of national budgets.
And in the Committee on Budgets we wonder how the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs thinks economic cycles, symmetrical and asymmetrical shocks, should be confronted, each one as it comes or all of them in a coordinated and cooperative fashion, to a certain extent using the Community budget to this end.
We in the Committee on Budgets, which I would remind you approved the opinion unanimously, have the impression that for the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs ideological prejudices carried more weight than the objective assessment of the economic options available.
Please allow me to remind you, as a teacher of public economy, Milton Freedman, said, that we are all Post-Keynesians.
He forgot about that majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of this Parliament.
The motion for a resolution is only Post-Keynesian in a chronological sense, but the basis of its thinking is pre-Keynesian.
It takes up elements of the monetarism of the 80s and 90s without taking account of its background.
When the Maastricht Treaty was signed, perhaps all politicians, and certainly the economists, knew that we should get rid of the systematic deficit, that we needed a policy of financial rationalisation, but we also knew, since the 60s, that budgetary balance is only advisable in certain circumstances and conditions and that, in general, strict budgetary balance tends to be procyclic, that is to say that it tends to aggravate the cyclic tendency of the economy.
Kennedy' s advisers, if I may go back that far, illustrated, by means of the so-called budget surplus of full employment, how a balanced budget, even in certain cases of deficit, can create recession.
I would therefore ask you, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my committee, to take a more open perspective, as contained in our amendments, and to include them tomorrow in the text of the resolution.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Berès, Mrs Peijs, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say a few words about each of the reports, and also something about the previous speaker's comments of course.
No matter what political group he or she might belong to, I would never insinuate that a fellow Member had let himself or herself be guided by anything but objective policy considerations in reaching a decision or deciding how to vote.
The majorities that prevail may vary, but since I have been following its activities, the hallmark of the work of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has been a very objective atmosphere and one very much geared to the Community's economic and monetary policy, so that the suggestion that has been made here is one that I cannot agree with and would like to refute.
Nevertheless, I agree with you of course that within the euro area and also as regards our common foreign and security policy we need to speak with one voice, both internally and externally.
However, and this point concerns both reports, competition is becoming an increasingly global matter.
The euro will come into circulation in 89 days, and it is already the second most important currency in the world.
The euro coins and notes will make the importance of this single European currency on the world market very clear.
This is a very important aspect, and we must at all times be very disciplined about keeping Europe's presence on the world financial stage in mind.
Global competition does of course require that in addition to the single market and economic and monetary union the necessary coordination needs to take place within the euro area and within the European Union as a whole.
What does this mean?
On the one hand it means coordination so that a strong internal market is created in the euro area and Europe becomes more competitive.
On the other hand, you need to understand that it also involves maintaining freedom as the basis of competition within the framework agreed between the Member States.
We are, of course, not all convinced that coordination in itself is a panacea, because we also need to consider where coordination starts.
What mechanisms does coordination involve, and what are the limits of coordination?
Does coordination inhibit the functioning of the market or support it?
This is undisputedly a debate that we need to hold, as decisions cannot simply be taken under the heading of coordination.
That is why we are in favour of more debates on European issues in national parliaments, in favour of coordination by the Statistical Office of the European Communities and enhanced links with national statistical bodies, and in favour of mutual exchange of information as a means of achieving joint tasks.
However, we naturally oppose increased bureaucracy, the setting up of new bodies and higher expenditure on bureaucracy masquerading as coordination.
We need more efficiency and professionalism in the structures that already exist in order to improve what we do jointly.
That does not mean reducing freedom of action and freedom of decision making in the Member States.
And we also oppose the information that has leaked out about tax collection or the use of tax income, because we believe that there is no legal basis for that either.
I have simply highlighted two issues that we need to debate further.
We will be voting for the report, but not all the details about what is meant and what mechanisms are necessary have been clarified.
I would like to say one more thing to Mrs Berès: it is important that you have tackled the issue of the link between public finances and reducing inflation, and thus touched on the subject of assessing the financial markets.
We need to give public finances a clean bill of health again, so that we increase the investment capital at our disposal, and I therefore call on everyone mentioned in the report to do their homework properly and not just take cosmetic measures!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Karas, I cannot resist commenting on your speech.
In all instances where we already have sensible coordination of our economic policies in the European Union, we have chalked up enormous successes.
Government budgets over the last year have for the first time in decades shown a surplus, and that still holds good, Mrs Peijs, if we exclude exceptional income from the sale of mobile telephone licences.
I do not think that we should play this down in today's debate.
The success stories in the current year will not be so great.
That is because growth in the European Union has slowed down, but that is no reason to start harping on about inflation.
Nor is it any reason to start panicking.
No one can calm down our friends in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats.
No one - not in this House anyway - wants to print money.
No one wants to print money as a way of solving finance policy problems.
We only want to print money to provide the public with our new currency, the euro, on time, but nobody here is talking about an inadequate budgetary policy.
However, you know that too.
That is not what is at stake here!
Essentially, it is about something quite different.
You know very well that, in the past, these budget consolidation successes that I have been talking about were not achieved by increasing income but by cutting expenditure.
Those expenditure cuts led to a positive result, but also had negative affects.
In many areas, public infrastructure is in a state of decay.
In many places social networks are under great pressure and our investment patterns both in the private sector and in the public sector have led to key strategic deficiencies in comparison with our competitors on the world scene.
We now find ourselves in a situation in which government receipts will decline for cyclical reasons.
So the vital question is this: what should we do in that situation?
Are you really seriously envisaging further global cuts in public sector income and expenditure?
Do you really want to freeze budgets so that we fail to make the investment necessary for our future?
Do you want the European Union to enter a further procyclical phase which will prevent us from benefiting from long-term growth overall?
I cannot imagine that that is what you want.
Mr von Wogau asked me at lunchtime today what the Socialists really want.
I can give him an answer: we want to stop these scare tactics!
We want to put an end to talk that recovery in Europe is always just short-term, because if the central banks or governments are running scared, we will lose long-term opportunities.
We have tabled amendments that we think are sensible.
If you can agree to compromise with us, then we can find a common path.
And if that is not possible, we will go our separate ways!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my intervention by agreeing with Mrs Berès' s complaint, because it really makes no sense to have held a debate, which is otherwise very interesting, on the Growth and Stability Pact and on the conclusions of the ECOFIN in Liège, to have debated 'television without frontiers' in the middle and now to hold what I believe to be a logical continuation of the first debate, the reports by Mrs Berès and Mrs Peijs, to whom I would like to say, on behalf of the Liberal Group, that they have our support and favourable vote.
I feel compelled to relate this afternoon' s debate to the subjects of these reports, above all by referring to the current economic situation.
It is clear that over the first few months of this year, the slow-down of the American economy has had more influence than was initially expected, and that the terrible terrorist attacks on New York and Washington have further worsened these prospects through needs for economic intervention which are truly new, urgent and no doubt justified.
The strain of the situation, however, should not lead us to justify greater public intervention or, as the President-in-Office of the Council has said very correctly, to abandon or lose sight of the need to continue with the structural reforms which the European economy still needs if it is really going to be competitive on an international level.
I trust that confidence will be recovered in the economic field as soon as possible and that the current special situation will be overcome, and we will shortly find that we have the same requirements that we had three months ago, that is, to consolidate the European economy, to make it more competitive in accordance with the Lisbon criteria, to strengthen coordination and, as we have often said to Commissioner Solbes, to have a genuine economic and monetary approach and policy, as the existence of the euro and monetary union demands.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is my basic point, although there are other detailed matters which are sufficiently well-expressed in the respective reports by Mrs Berès and Mrs Peijs.
Mr President, I want to deal particularly with the issue of public expenditure, quality and employment.
The explanatory statement of Mrs Peijs' report is very interesting because it explains the background.
We have to beware of chasing the American economic model.
One of the things that has made many people within the European Union hostile to the euro is that they have seen its introduction as linked to cuts in public expenditure.
We have seen, with the American economic model, the prioritising of the private and the cutting of the public.
The result has been a tremendous disparity between rich and poor and high levels of child poverty - unlike in countries which invest in social expenditure and reduce the wealth gap.
We know that child poverty is linked to poorer educational attainment, poorer job prospects and so on.
We have also seen in that economy a reduction of job security and longer working hours, with the introduction of a flexible contract culture.
In the UK, contracting out at lower cost quite often means compensatory tax measures at the lower end of pay, a public subsidy to poor wages from poor employers.
The American model also represents an unsustainable pattern of consumption, which will have an economic impact in the longer term.
My group believes that Mrs Peijs' report does not look sufficiently at the quality of the contribution of public finances.
So we cannot support the report in its current form.
Hence the amendments we have tabled.
I know that it is very difficult to measure the benefits of public expenditure in the same way we look at the balance sheet of a private health care company for example.
Public expenditure is an investment in social cohesion and we are gradually coming to recognise the costs of not investing in that.
Indeed, a priority for the European Union now is combating social exclusion.
We count as an economic success private spending to compensate for the lack of public expenditure.
Every burglar alarm bought, for example, is because we feel we are not safe.
We agree that we need to reduce the cost of employing people and to focus on lifting taxation costs for the poorer paid, many of whom are women.
But we also need to reduce working hours as part of increasing employment opportunities.
It is clear to us that a knowledge-based society which tackles social exclusion - we have to remember that Lisbon also said that - needs greater investment.
And where will that come from if there is no significant public expenditure?
Employers increasingly want ready-trained employees as part of the flexible contract culture.
We consider that public investments can have a very positive value and can help to shift the direction of our economy, as we recognise our ecological responsibilities.
Mr President, the Peijs report states that, over 20 years, government expenditure has increased from 35% to 50% of the GNP.
What has caused this increase in government expenditure?
Is it because public services have been improved, the number of hospitals has increased, additional hospital staff have been hired, public transport and national education have been developed, sufficient social housing has been built?
No, it certainly is not!
Over the past 20 years, many governments have, on the contrary, privatised services that used to be public.
All these governments have pursued money-saving policies with regard to essential public services, have got rid of railway lines, local post offices or hospitals, which are not considered to be profitable.
The reason that government expenditure has increased is because of the extravagant sums of money given to employers on a multitude of pretexts, ranging from direct subsidies for reducing taxes and social contributions to giving all types of support - all government authorities seem to excel at making these up.
Mrs Peijs cynically proposes making this policy worse by further reducing employers' social burdens and increasing VAT.
The poorest people are being made to pay in order to give money to the richest - if this is not brutal and direct class politics then it is hard to imagine what else it can be.
I shall of course be voting against this report.
Mr President, at the outset I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs on the presentation of their reports.
In recent months the global economic climate has been the cause of some concern.
We in Europe are certainly not immune to economic downturns in the United States.
The tragic events that took place in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on 11 September have undoubtedly further shaken economic confidence.
In Ireland, as in all Member States, we remain committed to maintaining current budgetary levels.
The reaffirmation of this commitment at Liège will allow the EU to better address cyclical fluctuations.
I welcome also the statement by the Commissioner that governments will be able to use automatic stabilisers in the context of a slow-down in growth.
Indeed, in Ireland, we continue to run a budget surplus which affords us some room for manoeuvre.
The Irish stability programme is central to the budgetary process in Ireland.
It is discussed in Daíl Éireann and is a key component of our annual budget.
The primary objective of the Irish budget and stability programme is the continuation of sustainable economic growth, supported by moderate inflation and competitive wage developments, reflecting our national agreement with the social partners known as the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.
As the House knows, the Ecofin Council this year, on a proposal from Commissioner Solbes, issued a recommendation to Ireland stating that she did not comply with last year's EU broad economic guidelines on fiscal policy.
The Irish government contends that its budgetary policy seeks to achieve economic stability by securing the continuation of social partnership and also by taking action to reduce price inflation, including indirect tax reductions.
We must look to the future.
Our immediate concern is the successful launch of the euro on 1 January.
But the single currency is not an end in itself.
It is conceived to facilitate a true single market for goods and services.
The grand project requires a high level of cooperation and coordination.
National governments must retain the prerogative to formulate a budget which best addresses the particular and specific economic situation of their country at that time.
Mr President, as usual, I am in full agreement with Mrs Peijs.
That is why I shall mainly confine myself to the report by Mrs Berès.
The European Monetary Union is accompanied by a certain level of coordination in the field of budgets.
However, coordination which goes beyond what is necessary for the EMU deserves to be questioned.
Further coordination can only be justified through sound reasoning, but this is lacking in both the Commission communication and in the Berès report.
There are, however, situations which require coordination.
The Commission mentions resistance to shocks as an example.
A recent illustration is the granting of subsidies to airline companies following the attack in the United States.
This is an excellent example of decisive action on the part of the Council of Ministers.
Coordination which goes beyond what is required will even prove counterproductive.
Labour participation, company policy, taxes - these are all matters which should fall within the remit of the Member States.
In substance, they give little reason for more coordination at European level.
Coordination of economic policy should not be used as a red herring.
After all, it is evident that times of economic adversity make it more difficult for the Member States to adhere to the EMU' s underlying principle: the Stability Pact.
The much-needed structural reforms should help meet the budgetary criteria.
Member States cannot afford to postpone using this instrument in order to obtain more permanent and responsible growth.
This growth is vital in order to secure the Stability Pact.
The need for reform is therefore all the more pressing.
It is, therefore, with good reason that the report does not nominate many concrete matters for coordination.
It is always useful to exchange information on economic policy decisions.
More important, however, is the quality of the decisions per se.
The report does not comment on the motives for closer cooperation.
This does nothing to help the case for coordination.
With the EMU, the European economies should not lose their own economic policies, tailored to their specific dynamics and character.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first to thank my friend, Karla Peijs, for her excellent report, in which she aptly describes the vital importance structural reform measures have for the prosperity of our societies.
Rarely does one see such excellent reports.
I wish to focus on two matters.
The public finances of a State in the euro area are no longer the private affairs of that State.
Any budgetary imbalances in an individual State, particularly a large one, may have an impact on the stability of the entire euro area.
For this reason, recent attempts to water down measures to reform state economies are worrying.
Many governments in recent years have relaxed their budgetary efforts, relying mainly on cyclical receipts, such as the proceeds from mobile telecommunications system auctions.
The consolidation process is still far from being complete, however.
The future objective is for a 'close to balance' or 'in surplus' budgetary position.
Member States must honour the commitments of the stability and convergence programmes unconditionally.
It will take perseverance and determination to balance public finances.
It will make us susceptible to populist criticisms of thinking of the economy like an accountant or balancing the economy one-sidedly.
Nevertheless, this is what we have to focus on.
Politicians have to take a few blows after all, but our economy will not be able to take a left hook.
Secondly, the rise in public expenditure in the last few decades has caused the governments of several of the Member States to increase taxation and social welfare contributions, which were already at an unendurably high level in Europe.
Simultaneously, the potential for economic growth has been weakening throughout this period.
That Last Mohican of orthodox communism, my colleague Mrs Bordes, could also stop talking about class war in this, the third millennium, and admit that the contribution of each and every European to the economy is important.
For that reason, work must be financially motivating and the benefits of different social welfare schemes at such a level that they safeguard the basic necessities of a normal, decent life, but provide an incentive for becoming active in all situations.
Only in this way can we achieve the ambitious aims of Lisbon.
Mr President, the challenges of globalisation make it clear to us just how important coordination of economic policies is for Europe, and also the integration of financial, employment and social policies, because little Europe is demonstrating to the world that it is possible to make progress in a region if regional cooperation does not just mean intergovernmental cooperation and is not just a free trade area.
I believe that the combination of the single market on the one hand and certain possibilities for giving political direction on the other is what makes the European Union what it is.
I therefore very much welcome the Commission communication and Mrs Berès's report, as they make it very clear that we need to make further progress with the coordination process.
We all know that the challenges and demands on us are now even greater than ever.
ECOFIN has quite rightly made sure that more integrated approaches are now being adopted, especially in the field of capital movements.
It is certainly important that we should not just act in unison and improve the quality of coordination, but that we should also agree on guidelines.
Fortunately, the Lisbon process, which was taken further in Stockholm, has given us both quantitative and qualitative objectives. Of course these still need to be extended and refined, but it enables us to demonstrate to the public that the coordination process can lead to positive outcomes.
If you could not say that, who would be interested in checking if all the Member States have actually met the requirements to which they have committed themselves?
One aspect of the commitments that they have entered into is the consolidation of their budgets.
Mr Bullmann was quite right to point out the progress made in this area.
It is certainly true that there is still more to be done in reducing debt in some Member States, but we should not forget that the Stability and Growth Pact exists as an instrument to prevent us ever exceeding a deficit of 3% of GNP.
That is at the heart of the convergence criteria and this deficit is intended to help us to achieve a favourable monetary policy that promotes development.
I believe that coordination can be enhanced still further, and that all those policies which can mutually or reciprocally support each other should be brought into this coordination process.
I also think that it is a particularly good thing that the European Parliament can call on the national parliaments to take part in the coordination process and I really wish to emphasise that point.
We, as a committee, have attempted to constantly highlight this cooperation with national parliaments.
Mr President, I would like to make one final comment. We should not see the coordination of policies as an end in itself.
We, in Europe, have missed out on growth because over the last few decades coordination has been lacking.
We lost out because we did not adopt a coordinated approach to the UMTS auction.
We could have achieved a totally different outcome.
Nor did we react jointly when the OPEC countries raised oil prices.
There is no doubt that we could have achieved a more favourable starting point for economic development if we had acted in a more coordinated way.
Mr President, Commissioner, in recent decades the per capita GDP in Europe has been reduced in comparison with that of America, increasing the gap or distance between our prosperity and development and that of the United States, while our levels of employment are also worsening.
The conclusion is drawn from this that the Americans do not hinder the activities of private companies through taxation as much as Europeans do and, in accordance with low levels of public expenditure, they have not, like us, promoted action plans, introduced bureaucratic systems or tried to guide their economic operators, who have therefore been able to dedicate themselves purely to working and generating wealth.
It seems to me that this analysis does not take account of the very important fact that, over the last 30 years, levels of public investment in the European Union have been reduced to 2% of our GDP in 2000, while in the United States they have maintained a sustainable level and represent 3% of their GDP.
If we add to this the fact that our per capita GDP stands at 65% of American GDP, it turns out that their average investment per citizen each year is 2.3 times greater than ours, and this is a more than notable difference which explains the differing developments of our respective economies.
I believe that the short-term solution for Europe is not to reduce taxes, but rather, while achieving balanced budgets and no deficit, we must adjust our current public expenditure and increase public investment in viable projects, modernising our infrastructures, supporting technological research and development, involving research institutes and universities in private initiative and promoting training and knowledge in our society.
What is completely unacceptable is the policy of the Spanish central government of Mr Aznar, which covers up its real budgetary deficit by financing it with revenue, with the monthly contributions of workers integrated into the state social security system, which compromises even further the uncertain future of pensions, and the workers who are currently contributing do not know whether they will receive those pensions on retirement.
This is unacceptable and must be condemned.
Mr President, two weeks ago, I was in the Netherlands on 'Prince' s Day' , the opening of the new parliamentary year, when the government budget is presented.
Not only because of the events in the US did I sit that day with mixed feelings, but also with a feeling of: what is this all about?
With the ever growing internationalisation of the economy, certainly in a country like the Netherlands, it is noticeable that at national level, there is, in fact, little room for economic manoeuvre.
It is, of course, possible to place accents, and I welcome the Dutch government' s proposal to step up investment in the public sector.
However, the scope remaining to make a real difference is relatively limited and is determined at entirely different levels. One feels far closer to this in Brussels.
On the other hand, I felt completely at home as regards the way in which such a budget is prepared in the Netherlands.
It is based on sound analyses and prognoses issued by what we still term the Central Planning Bureau, and broad, medium-term recommendations by the Socio-Economic Council in which independent experts, social partners and the Dutch Bank work in harmony.
In this way, a government can make plans which receive broad support and which can be effective.
The paradox of the phase which we are at with European cooperation, is that, although the political control of the socio-economic policy has been moved onto a European plane, the instruments and procedures for this are still located at national level.
Neither the European political structure, nor the European actors are prepared for this.
Unfortunately, for I am convinced that Europe is in need of such sound and broad socio-economic coordination.
I am therefore pleased with Mrs Berès' report.
She makes proposals for improved coordination within the euro countries, for greater involvement of national policy-makers and parliaments and for better harmonisation among the various actors at European level.
I would particularly like to underline the role of the macro-economic dialogue which must be afforded a far higher profile, also in the preparation of the broad economic guidelines.
A broader debate thereafter, also involving national parliaments, is important.
This concludes my comments on the Berès report.
I would once again invite Mrs Peijs to deal with the amendments which we tabled so as to reach a compromise after all.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the report by Mrs Berès on the Commission communication on the prospects for monetary union.
I think, however, that after the tragic events of 11 September the proposed measures and experiments should be implemented much sooner if we want the monetary union to fully perform the role that awaits it in fighting terrorism, maintaining economic growth and the competitiveness of Europe, and affirming a policy of peace and international cooperation that will isolate terrorism in developing countries.
I refer first of all to the need to face the slow-down in economic growth by means of coordination of our economic and social policies, countering the economic cycle. This can be achieved through enhanced cooperation measures between Eurogroup members, resulting in a real government by agreement of the monetary union, able to question decisions by the European Central Bank with an authority at least as great as that shown a few weeks ago by the United States Federal Reserve.
I also refer to the urgent need within the monetary union above all to achieve the greatest transparency and a reciprocal information system on movements of capital, overcoming the restrictions of bank secrecy so as to be able, Mr Karas, to strike at the transfer of resources linked to terrorist funding, the laundering of dirty money from organised crime, and the offence of tax evasion.
I shall close, Mr President, by also mentioning an international cooperation policy which will allow long-term contracts for supplying Europe with raw materials to be drawn up also in euro.
Mr President, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs very much.
There is no doubt that what has been said this evening is going to help us in our subsequent work.
I will begin by commenting on the Bères report and I would like to express my satisfaction with Parliament' s motion for a resolution which supports the strengthening of economic policy coordination within the euro area.
We must not forget that economic policy coordination is an obligation laid down in the Treaty.
The Treaty makes it very clear that our model is based on a single monetary policy and on national, but coordinated, economic policies.
This is a key element of our model.
It is true that coordination is still going through a learning phase.
It is also true that we have increasingly greater interdependence - especially in the euro area but also in the Union in general - and this requires that the content, the systems and the instruments we use are constantly being reviewed.
That is why I must especially welcome the report which Parliament has produced and salute Mrs Bères and all of those members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs who have participated in her magnificent work.
I believe that this work, in many respects, goes further than the Commission' s proposal, particularly with regard to one fundamental aspect, the increase in national participation in economic policy coordination.
I would like to highlight two essential elements of the report - and I will comment on the various interventions in relation to them.
The first is the need to strengthen coordination, the second the need to increase the democratic debate and national participation.
With regard to the content of the coordination, I think it is worth expanding on certain points.
The report supports the Commission' s proposals on the production of periodic reports on the economy of the euro area.
Today I can tell you that our idea - we have continued to work on this issue - is that we must have detailed economic analyses but also relevant proposals on economic policy.
We must go further than specific analysis.
In her speech, Mrs Bères raised the need to improve statistics and the assessment of policies.
It is true that we have made progress with the statistical plans for the Union' s monetary area, however, we must go further.
It is partly a problem of bringing national statistics into line with new realities, it is partly a problem of money, but, in some cases, it is neither of these problems, but rather the problem of acquiring the data necessary for a good definition of economic policy more quickly.
This perhaps means that in the future we will have to consider the need for our own statistical information which is not an aggregate of national statistics.
This would certainly be a key element if we are to be able to act within a time frame similar to that available to other economic authorities.
She makes a reference in her report which I believe to be fundamental in relation to trying to achieve a common vision of the impact of economic cycles on public finances.
We have held part of this debate today - I will comment later when I talk about the report by Mrs Peijs - but we believe it is essential for the ECOFIN Council to produce a methodology as soon as possible, allowing us to examine the concept of structural deficit by means of the same criteria.
And we are working on this, which seems to us essential, precisely to allow these automatic stabilisers to come into play depending on the extent to which the budgetary situation of each of the Member States allow it, but applying the same criteria in all cases.
A further point relating to the first element I mentioned, the content of coordination, is that of prior information.
This is a point which always gives rise to a degree of debate and discussion.
When we talk about prior information, we are talking about two different things.
We are talking firstly about the other partners of the Eurogroup knowing the broad guidelines for those essential elements of a national economic policy which may eventually have an affect on the rest.
Let us take one case: the tax reduction measures adopted last year as a result of the oil crisis.
There is no doubt that if we had acted as we have acted this year on the issue of insurance cover for airlines, we would have achieved a better result and a better approach from the point of view of the Union' s position.
The same can be said of the UMTSs.
If we had debated, before taking the decision, how to deal with the possibilities and difficulties which one or other option with regard to licences for third-generation mobiles could pose, there is no doubt that we could have prevented some of the subsequent problems.
We are not saying that we should all do the same. We are saying that we can hold discussions together in order to try to decide on a framework, which includes the different national decisions and allows us to take a more coherent position.
I said that there is a second aspect to prior information and that is that ministers should take Community elements into consideration when defining their national policy.
And I relate this reference to the one made by Mrs Bères in relation to increasing national participation in the broad guidelines for economic policy.
Until now, it has more or less been considered that we had two processes which did not necessarily converge.
On the one hand, reaching an agreement on the broad guidelines for economic policy in Brussels, in Luxembourg; on the other, defining our national economic and budgetary policies.
And each process took a different route.
It was also believed that compliance with the Stability Pact was sufficient to satisfy the coherence and consistency of the system which we have implemented for economic policy coordination.
It is becoming increasingly clear to us that the two instruments we have, the Stability Pact and the broad guidelines for economic policy, are key elements.
And the broad guidelines for economic policy, if they are actually approved by the ministers as a real commitment to be applied in each of the Member States, must reflect the budgetary policy which each minister wants and must present to their national Parliament.
I believe that this would help us enormously in terms of a better interrelationship between the decisions adopted at Community level and the decisions adopted by national Parliaments.
In this respect, the Commission believes that this idea of the debate is essential and we will fully support it.
However - and this is a point which I also wanted to comment on - it is true that we should not overly complicate the procedures.
Therefore, we are more cautious about certain ideas considered on the issue of macroeconomic dialogue.
It is absolutely clear that we have to improve its efficiency on the level of political dialogue, but we believe that we also have to maintain its character of frank and confidential exchange and, in this respect, it is essential to maintain this informal framework for debate and not formalise its process too much by complicating it and making the whole process of debate relating to this point less productive.
I would therefore like to end my comments on this first report by pointing out that the services of the Commission are currently looking into the implementation of some of the proposals included in the resolution, I have taken note of a series of suggestions that have been made this evening and we are naturally going to pay particular attention to them when producing our final proposal.
In relation to the report by Mrs Peijs, I would firstly also like to thank her for her suggestions and comments, but I would like to focus on just three or four points that I think are important.
Firstly, I fully agree with the idea that, in the context of the introduction of the euro, the credibility of a healthy public finance policy which is compatible with the euro is essential.
It is true that, in our view, public finances - we have said this clearly this evening - must be adequate for both crisis situations and for good economic situations.
In your report you refer to automatic stabilisers - and I do not believe that there is any great divergence between us on the analysis of this point.
We believe, like you, that they must play a fundamental role, both at times of growth and at times of slow-down of the economy.
We are grateful for your reference to tax reductions.
The Commission has been arguing that all tax reductions must respond to certain criteria, which are contained in your report, and which we believe are essential to maintaining the idea of quality of public finances.
No doubt if we were to debate tax reductions now, elements such as the promotion of consumption would be of more importance than would have been the case a few months ago, given that that is one of the issues we are concerned about.
But the idea of tax reductions can certainly be included in practice, in all cases, in the criteria contained in the document and which you support.
Finally, a comment on the sustainability of public finances in the long term.
There have been other comments on the labour market, on how we must move ahead, on coherence in relation to work, pensions, etc. In my opinion, all these elements will be dealt with within a broader vision of the labour market, while the finance ministers must pay particular attention to public finances and, in this respect, to the difficulties which may arise in the funding of social security given the global budgetary deficits of all public administrations.
The idea we are working with at the moment - and on the basis of your report, as you know, progress has already been made on some points - is not that reference be made by means of a short paragraph on the stability programmes, but that the stability programmes annually take up the necessary data to carry out an adequate evaluation of the evolution of public finances in relation to problems of ageing.
Nevertheless, in our view, the idea of including this information in the stability programmes is not because we believe they are problems which must be resolved through annual decisions - they need more long-term decisions - but because we felt it was appropriate to introduce new processes for approaching, analysing and monitoring the evolution of public finances.
Our idea is that, every four or five years, in each country, a more in-depth analysis should be carried out - it may be a supplement to the documents from the stability programme - on long-term public finances with the obvious fundamental problem of the ageing of the population and from which, nevertheless, when updating the annual programmes we only take the most necessary basic information.
I would like to end by thanking you all once again for your cooperation and the useful ideas you have offered us, which we will take into account as far as possible.
Mr President, I owe Mrs Van den Burg an explanation with regard to the amendments.
I did not bring the amendment numbers, so I will have to quote from memory, but Mr Bullmann will undoubtedly correct me if he thinks I am quoting the incorrect numbers.
Mrs Van den Burg, in order to reach a workable compromise, we will agree on Amendment Nos 4 and 5.
Amendment No 7 will be based on the text by Mr Bullmann to which a sentence will be added.
That is the oral amendment I was referring to. We will also agree on the second part of Amendment No 9 which starts with 'calls on the Member States' , Amendment No 10 by way of supplement and Amendment No 12.
I believe that is the complete list.
I would now like to respond to Mr Colom i Naval.
He has probably been waiting for this all evening.
Mr Colom i Naval, I would like to make this quite clear: content was not the issue.
The reason why we were unable to talk about this before we voted on the amendments is that I was firstly in the United States with the delegation - you will have noticed my absence in the committee at the time - and then I was in Rome with my group.
It was a slightly hectic month.
It was not a matter of content.
The fact is that the European Commission took the Member States as its point of departure in its communication.
I did the same in my report.
If, in your report, you were to write about the effects of the European budgetary policy on employment, then I would gladly vote in favour of all your amendments, but they did not feature in the framework of my report.
I apologise for the fact that we did not have an opportunity to talk about this.
That was a personal statement and was helpfully reconciliatory.
I would like to thank you too, Commissioner Solbes.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Competition policy (2000)
The next item is the report (A5-0299/2001) by Mr Agag Longo on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Commission's XXXth Report on competition policy 2000 (SEC(2001) 694 - C5-0312/2001 - 2001/2130(COS)).
Mr President, I am honoured to have been asked by my colleague, Mr Agag Longo, to present his excellent and detailed report to Parliament on the Commission's XXXth report on competition policy.
The report draws together several important areas of competition policy.
The rapporteur restates Parliament's strong support for Commissioner Monti in spelling out that effective competition is not only an important engine of economic growth but also works to the advantage of consumers, through greater variety, better quality and lower prices for both goods and services.
We congratulate the Commissioner on the success of European competition policy, but we recognise that such success can only be maintained by constant and rigorous monitoring.
Our rapporteur has highlighted further measures to which Parliament will be giving its attention in the coming months.
The future of car distribution is one area where we eagerly await the Commission's proposals.
I believe that our initial evaluations suggest that consumers are missing out under the current exemption, with unjustifiable price variations between Member States.
We also await the consultation on Merger Regulation No 4064/89.
We welcome Commissioner Monti's positive approach to consultation with our committee, but we repeat our call for major constitutional change which gives Parliament real codecision power with the Commission.
Commissioner Monti has played the central role in fostering a global approach to competition policy and enforcement issues.
Our committee supports efforts to build an international competition system in the framework of the WTO, whilst recognising that Europe's credibility in this area will depend on efficient and effective cooperation between the EU's own national competition authorities.
We are also looking to the outcome of negotiations between the Commission and the Council on the Commission's proposals for reform of the enforcement regime under Articles 81 and 82 which we approved last month.
Mr Agag Longo draws attention in his report to other important elements of Parliament's position on the reform, our strong support for Article 3 and our real concern over issues of legal certainty, as well as separation of powers.
I know that Commissioner Monti is aware of this, but we have consistently argued that the Commission must guard against the danger that the reform may lead to inconsistent application or even to a renationalisation of competition policy, thereby destroying the single market.
In continuing to raise these issues we reflect the concerns of many in the business community in Europe.
Our committee has also underlined other competition concerns.
We look to further market liberalisation, but we want effective enforcement of already agreed policy areas in the gas and the electricity sectors.
The Commissioner is aware of the complaints which have been made about some acquisitions by companies which do not appear to operate in a liberalised home market and we look to the Commission to investigate whether state-aid rules have been breached in such cases.
Mr Agag Longo also urges further progress on liberalisation in areas such as energy, transport and the postal services.
We welcome the progress which the Commissioner has made on state aid control.
We also support his work in ensuring that candidate countries for membership fully understand the requirements of EU competition policy, particularly the application and relevance of such rules in terms of market distortion.
Our committee will shortly respond in fuller detail to the Commission's ninth state aid survey, but this report also touches on this area.
We applaud progress on implementation of a public register of state aid and a scoreboard as important tools for promoting transparency and democratic control, even if I embarrass Commissioner Monti by saying that his practical demonstration of the scoreboard to our committee was frustrated by technical problems.
We view such widespread public access to information as essential.
In the same light we welcome the continuing commitment to hold competition day seminars under each Council presidency, although we are keen to see wider public knowledge of, and participation in, such events.
Finally, on an entirely personal note, I would like to express my concern that the Commission has made particularly slow progress over complaints concerning the Spanish government's treatment of Gibraltar citizens in relation to telecoms matters.
These complaints have been outstanding with the Commission for over five years, whilst the Commission has itself recently initiated a state aids investigation of Gibraltar's investment schemes, ordering it to cease forthwith until the Commission investigation is concluded.
I am bound to say that this hardly seems to me to be an even-handed approach and I hope Commissioner Monti will agree to look into this.
Otherwise I commend Mr Agag Longo's excellent report to the House.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent times, especially since the Stockholm European Council, the European Union has reached a turning point in competition policy.
That can be seen in the increasing conservation of structures.
The Agag Longo report rightly mentions this.
Following the successful liberalisations of the 1990s, postal services, electricity and gas are now trying to escape the annoyance of competition again.
First liberalisation, then regulation again, and the heading for this scenario is self-preservation.
The agenda for the Heads of State and Government in Laeken expressly provides for a discussion of the tension between competition and the preservation of existing interests.
We are all anxious to see whether competition can win through there.
If we ask about the difference between our modern, open society and another society marked by classes and castes, the answer is clear: in our open society competition has become the order, the principle on which our culture is based.
General acceptance of the principle of competition is therefore a tremendous cultural achievement.
But the state has never submitted itself to this principle.
It has always sheltered its education system, its banks, its railway, its airlines, its postal service, its telephone networks and its housing associations from the cold wind of competition.
Many sectors of the economy, too, claim that competition cannot work for them or that exposure to competition could be detrimental to the objectives they pursue..
There are plenty of examples.
Coal is valued because supplies are secure.
The market is said to be harmful to the health service because patients would be unable to assess the services provided.
In agriculture, the market is said to be inappropriate because farmers allegedly produce even more if prices are lower.
The postal service cannot be set free to compete - not completely, at any rate - because it has social functions to fulfil.
So we could go on.
But all these paltry excuses have one thing in common: they all recognise competition in principle, but simply claim that the principle is not applicable in their most particular case.
The situation in Europe has without a doubt become more difficult again for competition policy.
That is why it is important - and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is calling for this - that EU competition policy should now finally be extended to energy, transport and pharmaceuticals.
Let us therefore continue together to plan, campaign and argue for freedom.
Mr President, I must say firstly that I am truly perplexed.
I am perplexed by the fact that a British Member, though talking in place of a Spanish Member, has raised an issue that in no way relates to the rules on competition, that in no way relates to the reports on competition, but which relates to the unacceptable existence of the only territory in the European Union still to be decolonised.
It seems to me that to use the speaking time of a Spanish Member to raise these issues is, to say the very least, a discourtesy.
Anyway, leaving that aside, I believe that the discussion of the annual report on competition policy is a good opportunity to consider a debate on the progress and guidelines relating to this important European policy.
If we are to be self-critical, I would like to ask you whether we are really holding this debate or whether we are simply restricting ourselves to voting on a resolution which, if we are going to be honest, is more a cause for pity than for glory.
Please do not interpret this as a criticism of the Commissioner, Mr Monti, since I am more than happy to acknowledge his work in the area of competition and he has always been prepared to hold any necessary debates with this Parliament and has always been in favour of informing us promptly of the positions of his department.
Neither do I have any intention of criticising the rapporteur, who has produced a report of high quality and has also done so with flexibility and tolerance, accepting the positions of various political groups.
I therefore believe that my comments relate more to the behaviour of this Parliament and, fundamentally, to the vestiges of an era when its was simply a consultative assembly and did not have the co-legislative role which it has now.
We therefore have a tendency to issue documents, this document on the annual report on competition, and then go back to considering other issues on which we have already contributed as legislators, although unfortunately competition rules are excluded from the codecision procedure.
Furthermore, there is not always coherence between what we say at one moment and what we say at another.
Returning to the report, I would like to congratulate Mr Agag once again on its content, most of which we agree with, and to make a comment.
Once the Commission has taken its decision, I believe that there is no need for, and we should remove, the section relating to the prohibition of public companies investing capital in companies from the liberalised sectors - think of the conflict between Electricité de France and Hidrocantábrico - which Mr Agag introduces in his desire to stick up for and assist certain positions of the Spanish government.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur - who is now represented by Mr Evans - for a really sound report.
I should like to express my gratitude for the cooperation I have received from Mr Longo in preparing the report. I should also like to thank Commissioner Monti for his strong commitment to competition policy in the EU.
I should also like to take the opportunity to emphasise that the fight for free competition is a fight that must be engaged in ceaselessly.
There are at present quite a few good examples of free competition' s being threatened as soon as the opportunity arises for disrupting it.
The first, very telling example is the proposal tabled by the Commission to introduce an interim subsidy arrangement for certain types of shipbuilding.
The background to the proposal is that we in Europe believe we are exposed to unfair competition from South Korea.
Obviously, many interested parties try to exploit the situation in order to introduce a much higher level of subsidy than is justified by the realities of the situation.
Where this matter is concerned, I therefore wish to call upon the European Parliament and my fellow MEPs here in the House to stand by the Council' s resolution from last year to abolish all direct subsidies for shipbuilding.
The next example of an attempt to exploit the situation is provided by the aviation industry which is experiencing a lot of turbulence in these very days and weeks.
This has led many to campaign for the introduction of subsidies.
I should like to remind you that the problems experienced by a number of carriers are not primarily due to the tragic events of 11 September, but rather to the fact that the airline companies are now facing the harsh realities earlier than expected.
The whole sector has for a long time been in need of radical restructuring and, as politicians, we must ensure that the present frenzied and tumultuous situation is not used to introduce a mass of subsidies that are to be paid for by ourselves as taxpayers and that are designed to bail out a host of unprofitable companies and routes for which, as consumers, we shall have to pay the excess price over and above what we have paid in tax.
To conclude, I should like to return to a couple of specific points in the report.
I think it important that we should hold the Commission to its assurance that the new competition rules do not mean a renationalisation of competition policy.
It is also important that the Commission should continue to produce its annual report on State subsidies, even though it has now introduced the scoreboard for which I myself, for example, have for a long time been pressing and which I am very pleased about.
It is also my hope that the Commission will be attentive to the desire for a start to be made as soon as possible on looking into the rules for the repayment of unlawfully allocated State subsidies - an area which leaves a lot to be desired.
Finally, I hope that the Commission will follow up the request to look more closely into the possibility of improving the legal position of companies hit by losses and of involving third parties more extensively whenever the Commission deals with practical matters.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Agag Longo, and to Mr Evans for his speech.
I admire the quality of Mr Agag Longo' s report and appreciate the many constructive observations that have been made.
It does not escape me that the report also contains critical notes, and I assure you that, although it is impossible in this House to take a definite stand on all the observations made in the report, I can guarantee that all of them will be very carefully examined.
I am also grateful to the other speakers in this sitting - Messrs Konrad and Berenguer Fuster and Ms Riis-Jørgensen - for their political and, I must add, their cultural support for the European Union' s competition policy.

The thirtieth annual report summarises the developments that have occurred during 2000. A quick glance is enough to realise that the competition sector has continued to show intense activity, with a total of 1206 new files, 564 cases of State aid, 345 mergers and acquisitions and 297 cases of monopolies.
Work in the legislative field has focused on reform of our basic rules and regulations.
This activity has led to approval of new regulations on block exemptions in horizontal agreement issues.
New guidelines on vertical restraints have been adopted, in addition to the new 1999 block exemption regulation.
You will know that these new formulations give greater weight to economic guidance.
The fact that the number of cases of monopolies has fallen may be due to these new rules on vertical restraints, which have substantially reduced the obligation to notify this kind of agreement, and this gives the offices more room to concentrate on the more serious and difficult cases.
Considerable progress has been made towards a reform of the competition rules, to which Parliament gave decisive support a month ago, adopting Mr Evans' s report by such a large majority.
On the issue of mergers, a communication on corrective provisions has been adopted, as has a simplified procedure for certain straightforward types of operation, so that now about 40 per cent of merger cases can be dealt with in this way.
On the issue of controlling State aid, the Commission has introduced, for the first time, three groups of exemption regulations: on the application of the de minimis rule, on aid to small and medium-sized enterprises, and on aid for training.
I accept Ms Riis-Jørgensen' s point about recovering illegal State aid, because I too believe it to be very important for overall credibility.
As regards aid levels, the general trend that they are falling is confirmed, although this does not alter the fact that they remain very high.
Allow me, Mr President, to highlight the fact that, in relation to State aid and contrary to what paragraph 2 of your motion for a resolution would suggest, the Commission has effectively already instigated proceedings against State aid in the form of tax facilities and, on 11 July, the number of them had risen to 15.
We are also intensifying our efforts to recover the sums wrongly paid out in the form of State aid.
Let me now point out three aspects to which we are devoting special attention, not only in the last annual report but also in our everyday operations.
The first and most important is the impact of competition policy on consumers.
I know that Parliament shares our opinion that the consumer should be the final beneficiary of competition policy.
It is certainly necessary to make consumers more aware of the benefits of competition policy and to inform citizens about our activity and the effects it has for them.
As you will have noticed, the report gives examples of certain decisions, showing the benefits resulting from them for consumers.
A good example is the decision against OPEL Nederland to defend the right of consumers to buy a car without hindrance in a Member State in which prices are lower; other, more recent examples are an analogous decision against Volkswagen and the setting-up of an enquiry into mobile telecommunications prices charged by roaming operators.
On the subject of cars, I accept what Mr Evans said: the Commission is working hard to draw up a proposal for the period subsequent to 30 September 2002, when the regulation for block exemption from the motor vehicle distribution agreement comes to an end.
I intend to present a new draft regulation by the end of the year, and I am sure you will be glad to express your opinion on it, given the extreme interest Parliament has so far shown in this subject.
With regard to consumer information, may I remind you of the initiative of the European Competition Days, which grew out of discussions in this Parliament.
After Lisbon, Paris and Stockholm, the next will be held under the Belgian Presidency in Antwerp on 11 October, and will focus on competition in the pharmaceutical sector.
A second priority we are working on - one which several people have mentioned this evening - concerns State aid, not only to make control stricter but also to make this subject more transparent through initiatives like the public register and the scoreboard, which is, in fact, readily available on the Internet.
The third priority area of work concerns globalisation: how competition policy, by seeking greater coordination among the various parts of the world, can make its contribution to the governance of globalisation.
In this respect - apart, of course, from the highly intense relationships within the European Union with the national competition authorities - outside the European Union we have set up close bilateral working relationships and begun most welcome and far-reaching cooperation in particular with the competition authorities of the United States, and last week we held an intense session of work in Washington, at which we planned further development of such bilateral cooperation.
I think, however, that the bilateral dimension is not enough, and we are proceeding, with all the weight of conviction that the European Union has in this area, to develop two forms of multilateral cooperation.
One is the proposal to introduce some basic, binding competition standards within the World Trade Organisation. The other is the recent initiative to launch a global competition forum to provide a venue for world-level discussions among competition authorities.
Among our short-term priorities is the work now under way of modernising the competition rules, which we have been carrying out with even greater conviction - if that is possible - ever since Parliament gave us that vote by such a decisive majority.
Within the year we intend to conclude the revision of the de minimis communication, which, by specifying which agreements between companies are not forbidden under Article 81, Paragraph 1, will reduce the burden on companies, especially smaller ones, of conforming to the rules.
Having already mentioned the exemption regulation on cars, I should also like to refer to the policy against cartels, which is a basic pillar of any competition authority. By the end of this year we shall have further developed and updated the policy of indulgence, based on non-prosecution or reduced fines for those who collaborate in disclosing cartels.
This is yet another area of convergence between the American and European approaches.
In the matter of controlling mergers, the Commission' s priority for 2001 will be to continue to re-examine the mergers regulation.
In this respect, during the year I intend to draw up a formal consultation document on this subject.
As for the way new cases are dealt with, our work is focusing particularly on the recently liberalised markets, which were mentioned particularly by Messrs Konrad, Evans and others, such as energy, air transport, telecommunications and postal services, in an attempt to prevent the former monopoly holders from abusing the positions of strength that they traditionally enjoyed.
I thank you all once again for the expressions of support and encouragement you have given to the Commission in matters of competition: you know how important it is for the Commission and for me personally to have the support of Parliament in our everyday work, and how seriously we take your critical comments, which we value highly.
Thank you very much, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
E-commerce and financial services
Mr President, financial services should be the big winner from e-commerce, because the sector does not have the problems of physical delivery, unlike booksellers or grocery supermarkets.
A financial service, whether a savings vehicle like a pension or a mutual fund or just a simple bank account, is by its nature ethereal and intangible.
Many transactions in banking and stockbrokerage are already taking place online.
UNICE, the EU employers' organisation, estimates that nearly one-fifth of banking transactions in Europe are now executed through the Internet, direct dial, mobile phone, or digital television, nearly double the proportion in the US.
In the Nordic countries of the Union, the overall proportion is more than a third.
However, the vast majority of those transactions happen within an EU Member State.
Cross-border e-commerce in financial services is in its infancy and it has not chased prices down to the level of the cheapest Member State.
Indeed, the most recent survey suggests that bank charges vary more widely around the average than they did in the mid-80s at the beginning of the single market programme.
There is a lot still to do.
The e-commerce directive past last year was designed to encourage cross-border trade by enshrining the country-of-origin principle.
This is one of the essential market-opening principles of the internal market.
If harmonising rules is too difficult, at least recognise the right of any company to do business anywhere in the Union once authorised by one Member State.
The key judgment was that consumers would benefit more from increased competition than they might lose from the greater difficulty of seeking legal redress from a far-flung and delinquent supplier.
That is simply because the country-of-origin principle ensures the maximum amount of extra competition and extra competition is ultimately the consumer's best friend.
True, the e-commerce directive allows exceptions still subject to national regulation of incoming services, notably insurance in unit trusts.
In general, most of the liberally-minded market-opening fraternity were pleased to get it on the statute book.
As its full implications have sunk in, some Member States have been quietly attempting to restrict the scope of its application and backpedal on its implications.
This is the real significance of the Commission's White Paper on e-commerce and financial services.
It is designed to clear up the bits left out of the e-commerce directive and the report we are debating tonight is designed to support the Commission's resolve to open up the single market; if necessary, by insisting on the provisions of the e-commerce directive despite the reservations of some Member States.
We must maintain the liberal thrust of the e-commerce directive.
That means also setting a clear timetable to include both insurance and advertising of unit trusts in the general country-of-origin approach.
Insurance services, for example, are particularly suited to e-commerce provision.
It also means basing any guidance from the Commission to Member States about consumer protection on real documented problems, not on imagined ones.
Of course, there are real difficulties.
The Commission needs to look at these difficulties carefully and attempt to set out a clear road map to allow e-commerce and financial services to flourish.
Consumers are concerned about security, particularly with cross-border transactions.
Soft law provisions, alternative dispute procedures, should be made effective so that they can deal with the vast majority of problematic cases and we have asked for a regular report on that.
Some convergence of national rules on consumer contracts is clearly desirable, though this should not be used as an excuse to delay the single market.
Some standard features of terrestrial banking, like applying the money-laundering provisions by looking your depositor in the eye to ask where her or his money came from, require fresh thought in an e-depositing world.
It is also the case that financial services transactions are rarely entirely online without any offline elements, so we need to work as far as possible to ensure coherence.
The prize for getting this framework right is very great.
E-commerce and the euro can make a reality of cross-border financial services, not just for business but also for savers and the extra competition will, as it always does, bring long-lasting and real benefits.
So, I urge the House to stick to the line that we have set in the past in asking for opening up of this market.
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. Mr President, it gives me great pleasure this evening, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, to give our opinion on what is an excellent report.
We started work having the benefit of the full text of the rapporteur, Mr Huhne's report, and so our role was very much to improve on what we felt was already an excellent text.
From the perspective of the legal Affairs Committee, which was responsible for the E-commerce directive, we feel that the rapporteur's thrust - as he emphasised just now and in relation to the country-of-origin principle - is in line with our own opinion.
We would add our voice very strongly to that of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in encouraging the Commission to move down this line.
I want to pick up a couple of points on our amendments.
We are very grateful to the rapporteur for accepting all of the amendments of the Legal Affairs Committee and to the committee for voting them into the final report.
We lay particular emphasis on the question of a payment and payment systems.
It is quite clear from recent studies across the European Union that one of the things that is deterring consumers from shopping in the electronic age is worry about the security of their payments.
This will be absolutely crucial if financial services are to move forward.
So we have suggested a number of methods for improving the security of electronic payments.
We have encouraged the Commission, particularly, to take a look at emerging forms of electronic payment.
While at the moment a very high level of consumer transactions are made by credit cards, we think that new formats will emerge and that the Commission needs to take that into account.
In conclusion, legislation has to enable contracts to be concluded by means of electronic signatures in financial services transactions.
We pointed that out as a specific area to be addressed.
This is a very good report.
I encourage the House to give it its full support when we vote on it tomorrow.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Huhne, I, too, would like to add my congratulations to those of the previous speaker, Mr Harbour.
This is an excellent report and it was a pleasure to work with you.
I can already say that tomorrow we shall be fully supporting the line taken by this report.
There are at present two developments running in parallel that are very important for this field.
The Internet is growing in importance.
Trade over the Internet is growing more and more.
And on the other hand we are in the process of completing the internal market for financial services in Europe.
Our target is the year 2005.
Financial services in particular, because they are not material, are pre-eminently suitable to be offered internationally on the Internet.
I believe we will in the foreseeable future have a situation where customers buy insurance or banking services over the Internet not from a local bank but across the border in a neighbouring country and that the Internet is an excellent way of making comparisons in this field.
It is also important, however, that we win consumers over for this kind of commerce.
It is consumer protection that I am addressing here; competition has already been discussed.
But consumers will make e-commerce in financial services a success only if they have confidence in it, if the contractual or non-contractual provisions are in place to safeguard their rights and to give them appropriate help if they have complaints in cross-border business.
I support the Commission' s initiative here of setting up extra-judicial arbitration procedures such as FIN-NET.
Only if consumers are convinced that any problems they have in future will be sorted out will they make use of the net in future.
The third thing was mentioned by the previous speaker: technical systems.
Many people are still afraid and have misgivings about using the Internet.
I still have myself.
I am not going to put my credit card number on the Internet just like that.
There are still reservations and inhibitions about that sort of thing.
Online and offline commerce are moving closer and closer together and we therefore need to harmonise the legal provisions here, too.
I can only back what the previous speaker has said, that we must abide firmly by the country-of-origin principle, that the Commission must stand firm.
Parliament will also be making its position known tomorrow.
In smaller areas, too, however, like the abolition of national marketing and competition rules that stand in the way of the development of the Internet - fortunately, this was included in the report - we need to move forwards in order not to hinder development.
I would like to say in conclusion that e-commerce in this area will take a turn for the better, even if we may have gained a different impression from the stock markets in the last few months, but it will take off, it will continue to develop positively.
We need to make Europe fit for global competition, ensuring that in Europe, too, financial services can be offered in this way.
I therefore believe that this report shows the way and is a good step forwards, as is the Commission's support for it.
Mr President, I too congratulate the rapporteur on the report which he will present to us tomorrow.
We know he has worked extremely hard on this report and very closely with others in this Chamber to ensure its success.
Clearly the changing industry of financial services lends itself very well to the new technologies which have emerged and continue to emerge across the world.
The ability of consumers, confusing as it can be, to pick such technologies, to choose a variety of financial services within the individual Member States, has been with us now for some little time.
But the choice of financial products across borders inside Europe is even more recent an affair.
This means that services, rather than physical products - and the rights of consumers to have confidence in the performance of those services - is as vital here as it is for manufactured products.
The marketing and advertising of services, the claims and boasts of providers, must be checked against the need to allay the fears of risk to consumers, to safeguard their purchases and exchanges by electronic means.
This is why my group has so high a regard for the element of consumer safety.
The country-of-origin principle is simply the best agreed way of approaching the process of harmonising the standards for attaining an EU-wide application of the guidance for those standards which are to be expected in those nations.
At the same time Brussels, too, is clearly more than just an element for consideration by the Commission in this process.
The amendments before the House allow for the flexibility required to pursue the exciting new medium of technology, as does the text.
In particular I would like to recognise Mr Herzog's concerns, where he rightly points out in his amendments that we need to keep pace with technological change in order to reduce the possibility of criminality, of fraud and of money laundering.
My group believes that so long as consumer interests can be asserted and maintained as an essential element of the provisions of this report, then it is obviously going to be willing to withdraw any amendments that might suggest derogations or deletions to the country- of-origin principle.
The liberation of e-commerce is the element of any dynamic European economy of the future; the counterbalance that has to be struck and which has to be fully realised is the effects it has on those who would use it as consumers.
I commend this report to the House.
Mr President, the country-of-origin principle should meet the challenge of offering financial services electronically.
I have one comment to make.
First of all the scope for national policy.
The country-of-origin principle respects national legislation.
In addition, it is possible for Member States to deviate from the country-of-origin principle, but only on the basis of well-defined reasons.
That is why, in the report, the rapporteur might have provided more extensive reasoning with regard to the effect the principle has on national policy.
This would probably have prevented a number of unfortunate, socialist amendments from being tabled.
Furthermore, the report is based on the assumption that more competition can only benefit the consumer.
He should know the rules with which the supplier complies.
Otherwise, confidence in e-trade will not grow.
That is why the rapporteur might have been more specific in explaining consumer protection at European level.
If bottlenecks occur, it can become difficult to allow for exceptions because not all Member States will agree that there is a need for these to be made.
It is therefore useful to continue to monitor closely whether e-trade will be satisfactory to suppliers and consumers alike.
Mr President, I, too, would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur very warmly on his report.
My colleague Mr Skinner has already indicated that our group will be able to withdraw most of our amendments if we can get clarification on one point that is very important for us and which is also concerned with consumer protection - and the rapporteur has already indicated a willingness to accommodate.
I am also willing to accept that members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who have a responsibility for financial services in particular, naturally have a slightly different focus than so many members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
As a lawyer specialising in European law I do still often consult the EU Treaties.
Perhaps we should no longer do that so often.
Because when I turn to Article 50, which is about services that have not been harmonised, I read something about a market location principle, not a country-of-origin principle.
We are all aware that these provisions are creating a lot of problems today.
That is why Mr Harbour, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has introduced the proposal to amend the Treaty.
If we are lucky, we will be able to do that by 2006 at the earliest.
But until then we shall have to come up with something to cope with this problem.
I think we have found the e-commerce directive to be very well balanced in its conception.
I was myself shadow rapporteur for my group at the time and I hold fast to the belief that by combining harmonisation, country-of-origin principle and a few exceptions, we have found a very well balanced solution that we should probably try to use in other areas, too.
I am not a believer in magic formulas or cure-alls.
We are now at last getting the Council' s Common Position on the distance marketing of financial services.
We shall all have to put our thinking caps on to find a sensible solution for dealing with the problems that the Member States have also seen.
I think we will make it easier for ourselves if we go for pragmatic legislation rather than fight over principles and stay high and dry.
The Commission takes heart from the broad support for the Commission's objectives in the field of e-commerce and financial services - support evidenced by the report of your Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.
I welcome that report as being most balanced and constructive.
I draw strength from Parliament's clear commitment to the country-of-origin approach which, if I am not mistaken, has been supported by all who spoke on this subject this evening.
In particular I welcome the report's rejection of any attempt to roll-back the e-commerce directive in the area of financial services.
That is a position very much shared by the Commission and strongly defended during the negotiations on the distance marketing directive which, as Members may or may not know, resulted in a political agreement at last Thursday's Internal Market Council.
We will follow that line in future proposals and negotiations.
I should like to pick up on a few key points made in the report.
They are points which were also raised by various Members in the debate.
On the need for a road map setting out what needs to be done and when, in May the Commission published a financial services policy group report to the Ecofin Council.
That contains just such a road map and hopefully brings greater clarity about the way forward.
Amongst other things that road map sets out the concrete steps that must now be taken to enable the country-of-origin approach to apply across the board to cover those financial services currently derogated and to be applied to other traditional distance training modes.
In broad terms, that would involve further convergence in national consumer protection rules, in particular by updating EU legislation which predates the e-commerce directive.
On the Commission's guidance, where it is our aim to add transparency to situations under which Article 3(4) might be invoked, I should like to inform Parliament that this exercise was launched in July.
We are now in the process of receiving the first replies from Member States.
I should like to assure Parliament that it is not the Commission's intention for the guidance to represent a de facto additional derogation to the country-of-origin approach and that the guidance will be reviewed to take account of progress and further harmonisation of consumer protection rules, with the aim that it should become redundant by the 2005 Lisbon deadline for an integrated European market in financial services.
In respect of this point I would particularly like to say to Mr Radwan that earlier this year the Commission helped to put in place a network for the handling of cross-border complaints in financial services which ought to serve to raise still further the level of confidence of consumers who venture onto the Internet.
I hope that is to the liking of Mr Radwan.
May I further welcome Parliament's call for a single payments area in which it would be easy and cheap to transfer money across borders.
I should like to recall that in July the Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation to align the costs of cross-border payments with those made at national level.
I can also inform Parliament that with a view to making payments more secure, the Commission in February adopted a communication on the prevention of fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment, which set out a three-year action plan.
This point was also raised by Mr Harbour and I should like to add that the Commission is looking into the possibility of refunds.
I will inform Mr Harbour later of the progress in this respect.
Finally, I take note of Parliament's interesting suggestions that the Commission should seek to negotiate mutual recognition agreements with third countries, at least with those third countries that provide similar levels of prudential supervision and investor protection.
The Commission finds that a very valuable suggestion and we should like to consider it further.
In conclusion, I very much welcome the draft report as its stands.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Huhne, for his strong support for the country-of-origin principle.
Indeed all speakers this evening have echoed this strong support.
I nonetheless express concern about a number of the amendments which were recently tabled by some honourable Members.
Several of the amendments, unfortunately, are not acceptable to the Commission.
They would shift the balance of this report unfavourably and undermine the strong support which Parliament has shown for the Commission's e-commerce strategy in the past.
That support was so manifest and so vital at the time of the adoption of the electronic commerce directive last year, when Members voted unanimously in favour of the directive and the underlying country-of-origin approach.
That is precisely the approach which the Commission, with the support of Parliament, would like to continue.
Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Internal market strategy for services
Mr President, I would like to begin by taking the opportunity to reassure Commissioner Bolkestein.
We have already said in the two interventions on the Huhne Report that most of our amendments have already been withdrawn.
Both of us have emphasised that here.
So far as I know, there are two amendments remaining.
The Commission can easily live with that and I hope the rapporteur can, too.
A vote will be taken on the amendments tomorrow.
Now to my own report, however.
We know from experience in this House that the agenda is very often changed.
We are often glad about that to a greater or lesser extent.
This time there is a real point to it - my report was deferred so that the debate on the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan could be held yesterday.
That is certainly more important than the further refinements we want to make to the internal market.
It also allows us to hold a kind of joint debate today.
The field of financial services, services generally and also Mr Radwan' s report, which will be debated next, go together very well.
I am sure we all agree that services generally as well as financial services and information services deserve our special attention.
They are rightly described as the key area of the European economy today.
Two thirds of Europe' s workforce are already employed in the service sector.
Above all, the dynamism and innovation that make this sector so important will enable us to achieve the objective set in Lisbon.
If my report has given rise to some differences of opinion, they are never about the objective, only about what we consider to be the most appropriate means of achieving that objective.
I am sure we can support the Commission' s approach of identifying all the barriers in a first phase, listing all the obstacles encountered by service providers, and then in a second phase proposing suitable remedies.
But we have no time to lose.
We now have the remedy of treaty infringement proceedings.
In many cases, better information from authorities, professional bodies and similar institutions about the law as it currently stands could perhaps help to remove some unjustified obstacles.
In all but one of the urgent legislative measures listed by the Commission - I have to admit it is the reform of public contracting - Parliament has not been responsible for any undue delay on any other points.
The call for certain legislative measures to be speeded up should therefore be addressed primarily to the Council.
I have already mentioned that we have now at last received the common position on the distance marketing of financial services.
Discussions in the Council took a very long time.
I hope we can make up some of the lost ground in Parliament and make rapid progress.
Something else that has already been before the Council for a very long time is the two directives on the situation of third country citizens when it comes to providing services - employees on the one hand and self-employed on the other, where the introduction of a service provision card could make a major contribution to achieving freedom in the provision of services.
I am also sorry that the Commission itself no longer lists these measures as priority measures in this communication today.
Essentially, our differences of opinion are over which legal instruments will be suitable.
We should not rule any instrument out.
We will need further harmonisation.
I am sure we will be able to implement the country-of-origin principle on the basis of harmonised, coordinated, largely approximated laws in our Member States.
Article 50 of the EC Treaty will probably also continue to be used in a number of remaining areas.
I do, of course have a problem when harmonisation is automatically described as over-regulation and when the country-of-origin principle is to be used as a magic bullet, the cure all to solve every problem at a stroke.
Unfortunately, things are not like that.
We have to go this laborious way of finding the appropriate instrument for every problem that arises.
I would again like to point out that even in the e-commerce directive - important as the role of the country-of-origin principle is there, and I fully support the content of that directive - the regulating principle is not the only one to apply.
The amendments that have been tabled for tomorrow follow two principles: preserving freedom of choice of legal instruments, not confining ourselves to one instrument, and not making any sector-specific changes.
That is also in line with the Commission' s wishes, since it deliberately wanted to present a document applicable to all sectors.
Mr President, I would first like to express my thanks to the rapporteur and my colleagues Messrs Harbour and Beysen who, in the responsible committee, have done an excellent job of including and taking into account the views expressed by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on this matter.
I am very glad that the European Parliament is now about to take a decision on supporting the Commission' s proposed strategy for creating an internal market for services.
The need for this is enormous - for economic growth, for the advancement of companies, for employment and for consumers.
An internal market for services has for a long time been a missing element in a European growth policy, a policy which must also be supplemented by measures to speed up the liberalisation process in sectors such as postal services, electricity and energy - something which cannot be said too often.
The Commission' s overall course of action is good.
We cannot continue with sectoral regulation of services, something which has so far proved to hinder, rather than facilitate, the creation of an internal market.
Ninety-nine per cent of European companies are small and medium-sized. These employ 66 per cent of workers and generate 55 per cent of turnover.
Bearing in mind the significance of these companies for the European economy, it is necessary for them to be able to benefit fully from the internal market for services - a market which quite simply cannot function well without them.
It is also important that the candidate countries should be involved as soon as possible.
What is known as the enlarged internal market for services must also be well prepared.
Finally, in order for this work to be a success, the Commission must not be left alone.
We have a major responsibility here in Parliament, but the Member States too have a great responsibility to involve themselves in the process and to work at political, legislative and administrative levels to remove obstacles to the exchange of services.
Without political will at all levels, the goal cannot be achieved.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Berger very much for her clear statement of support for this proposal this evening.
Those of you who have looked at the report will know that she withdrew her original explanatory statement.
I was delighted to hear this evening that she had confirmed her full support.
This report, with the support of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and my colleague, Mr Beysen, and with Mrs Berger's assistance also, now strikes the right balance by giving the Commission a clear indication of the support of our committee and others for this important initiative.
I am delighted that Mrs Berger is going with the flow of that for many of us felt that her initial report really did not do full justice to what we regard as an imaginative proposal, a wide-ranging proposal, and one that is of crucial economic importance to the future of the European Union.
We must not ignore the continual structural change in the world economies, in particular in developed economies like the European Union.
We are seeing services and manufacturing business starting to converge.
We are seeing more integration of traditional service providers, with their manufacturing arms looking to focus on customers in a very different way.
Therefore, opening up the single market for services is going to be of great importance.
One thing I particularly welcome from the Commission's analysis - something it has indicated in the report that it will now do more work on - is that it highlights the importance of a highly competitive service infrastructure in the overall competitiveness of European industry.
So many businesses depend on high-quality, effective, low-cost, efficient services to deliver their businesses.
Indeed the whole of the electronic commerce area, which we talked about in financial services earlier on, is facilitating and opening up these sorts of markets.
Therefore, this communication is extremely welcome.
We look forward, in the Legal Affairs Committee as well as in the Industry Committee, to working with the Commission and to moving forward with the necessary legal framework and the other actions that will be necessary to achieve it.
I want to reinforce what Mrs Grönfeldt Bergman said about the role of the small- and medium-sized enterprises in this sector.
Again we are seeing the combination of increasing importance of services combined with electronic commerce and the electronic means of delivering those services.
That is an area, particularly crucial in the business-to-business sector, where small- and medium-sized enterprises have a crucial role to play in the European economy.
Again, these provisions will help.
I refer back to the country-of-origin principle.
I share Mrs Berger's view that by a happy coincidence we have a set of reports tonight with a common thread running through them.
I do not regard the country-of-origin principle as a magic bullet to achieve market integration at a single stroke.
Clearly there is a lot of work to be done.
Yet, by operating the country-of-origin principle vigorously and consistently we will actually achieve competition and higher standards for consumers more quickly than by any other means.
Consumers are going to be well-informed and intelligent enough to know where the best standards of consumer protection are.
They are going to demand them from other countries.
This is not a question of harmonising down.
It is an effective means of making the market operate in the interests of consumers, which is exactly what Commissioner Monti told us in addressing the competition report earlier on.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the attainment of a real internal market for services will afford the small and medium-sized enterprises added incentive for innovation - as was already underlined in the debate, in fact. It will also improve the competitiveness of European industry and will provide more benefits to the consumers who will be offered a whole series of high-quality competitive services.
I am therefore of the opinion that it is of crucial importance for the internal market strategy to build on the strength of the e-commerce directive and the principle of mutual recognition.
Mutual recognition forms the keystone of the European Union and the European internal market, in particular.
Mutual recognition is only possible if the consumer enjoys equivalent protection right across the Union.
This means that harmonisation is only required if this equivalent protection does not exist.
Furthermore, a business based in the Union is guaranteed completely free cross-border trade in services.
I therefore believe that the report, as it has now been approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, after inserting, inter alia, a number of amendments which I myself tabled, reflects and supports the Commission' s balanced approach.
Finally, I am delighted to find out that the Commission adopted a regulation on sales stimulation yesterday.
This shows that the Commission is really serious about further developing the internal market.
In the current economic climate, we cannot afford to lose momentum in the direction of a real internal market.
Mr President, firstly the Commission would like to emphasise the economic and political importance of its communication on a new internal market strategy for services, which I hope, will henceforth enjoy the European Parliament's full support.
A functioning internal market in services, far from being a reality, remains an objective to be achieved.
It is an objective which ought to be considered a priority if we really want the European economy to become the most competitive in the world by the end of this decade - the ambition we set ourselves in March 2000 in Lisbon.
Just to quote a single fact, services account for two-thirds of the European economy and, therefore, any progress we make on that front will greatly benefit the citizens of this continent.
Achieving that goal is rendered all the important by the growing dynamic of the information society, with all its potential for cross-border trade, and by the imminent introduction of the euro, which will increase the transparency of costs and encourage businesses and consumers to look beyond national boundaries for the provision of services.
Unfortunately, at present there are still too many legal and administrative obstacles preventing our businesses and consumers from considering the whole of the European Community as their true domestic market.
That means that we are failing to realise the enormous potential for growth and establish a framework in which millions of new jobs can be created.
At no other time in our recent history has it been more important to encourage entrepreneurship, innovation and opportunity.
Just as the 1992 campaign enabled us to focus on - and to a large extent achieve - an internal market in goods, it is now crucial for us to concentrate on dismantling the barriers to trade and services.
This new strategy seeks, above all to enable two groups - namely small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers - to reap the full benefits of the internal market.
In many instances, small and medium-sized enterprises - which Mr Harbour and Mr Beysen have mentioned also evening - will not have the means to establish themselves in all or several Member States.
If they try to do so, they will be faced with the need to expand their infrastructure and with extra financial and administrative burdens.
Therefore, they must be allowed to offer their services freely throughout the Community from their establishment.
As far as consumers are concerned, this strategy is designed above all for them.
We shall not have succeeded until European consumers have greater access to and a wider choice of, safe and reliable services at more competitive prices, and that means there must be more competition between service providers.
The strategy is the first attempt to apply, at Community level, a horizontal approach to trade and services since the General Programme for the removal of barriers to services of 1962 was introduced almost forty years ago.
It calls for the cooperation and support of national authorities, the participation of all interested parties and the active engagement of the Community institutions.
The report by Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has highlighted many of the difficult issues preventing an effective internal market in services from functioning.
I am delighted that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market shares the Commission's philosophy and supports its ambitious approach.
I also hope to be able to count on the full support of the European Parliament in implementing both the first and second phases of the strategy.
The first phase is now being carried out.
This means that existing restrictions to the freedom to provide services and the freedom of establishment are being identified and evaluated.
In the second phase, legal and operational instruments for the elimination of barriers will be put in place and our approach will be based on harmonisation, assuring a high level of consumer protection combined with the principles of country of origin and mutual recognition enshrined in the Treaty.
Accordingly, the Commission would not welcome the newly tabled amendments.
Those amendments appear to run counter to the principles of mutual recognition and country of origin and, in the Commission's view, would undermine the positive and well-balanced approach of the report, for which the Commission is duly grateful.
I should like to thank Mrs Berger on behalf of the Commission for having drafted that report.
The Commission feels that the newly tabled amendments would significantly weaken the support of the European Parliament for the proposed internal market approach.
In conclusion, I refer to the earlier discussion between Mrs Berger, Mr Harbour and Mr Beysen on the various merits and demerits of harmonisation, mutual recognition and the country of origin.
Large-scale harmonisation may waste time, prove unnecessarily bureaucratic and divert political goodwill and attention away from the key issues that Member States should agree on.
It may also contravene the subsidiarity principle in the Treaty.
On the other hand, it must be admitted that harmonisation may be necessary where there is a need to establish a high level of protection, notably for consumers.
Mutual recognition, on the other hand, can be made to work more satisfactorily if it is implemented through secondary Community legislation which clearly identifies the areas in which mutual recognition must be accepted.
Both principles have their merits and demerits, but by and large I am inclined to agree with Mr Harbour's view that the quickest way of achieving an adequate level of protection for the consumer is to adopt the country-of-origin principle.
In conclusion, may I thank Mr Beysen for his kind remarks on the sales promotion directive adopted by the Commission this week.
Lastly may I apologise to Mrs Berger for having omitted previously to thank her on the Commission's behalf for having withdrawn almost all of the amendments tabled on the previous matter.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Pre-contractual information on home loans
Mr President, Commissioner, we have now reached the last item on the agenda and I hope that the crush of Members will not now be too much.
What is this report about?
It is about the question of precontractual information on home loans.
We are in the process of creating an EU internal market by 2005, and one of the objectives is that in future cross-border home loans should be offered and taken up by customers.
An agreement in the matter has been reached at European level between consumer associations and banking associations.
We need that to be put into effect relatively quickly.
It would be gratifying if that were to happen in less than twelve months.
I would like at this point to expressly highlight the positive role played by the Commission, which managed to bring the two sides together repeatedly and in the end achieve a result in this difficult moderation process.
This may become the first positive example of self-regulation in the European Union.
But there are still things that need to be done.
First, we must look at the moderation process itself.
It took about four years and according to some participants was not always very transparent.
We call on the Commission to report to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs about the experience gained from this moderation process and the conclusions to be drawn for future self-regulation processes.
As I have already said, it may be a positive example. But if it proves not to be a positive example of self-regulation, the Commission really will have to put forward its own proposal for a directive.
A few points are still outstanding here.
Firstly, of course, we need a commitment not only from the banking associations, but we need a Europe-wide commitment from the banks themselves.
The extent to which the banks will participate is an open question here.
Secondly, the register that is published must of course also be posted on the Internet.
We also need similar forms throughout Europe.
It is already foreseeable that some Member States that were very keen on producing a standard form, especially at the outset, will want to go their own way and may take a different route in future.
At all events, comparability must be preserved here, in the interests of the customer.
We ought to try to extend this agreement to the candidate countries.
We should also extend the mediation body you have just mentioned, Commissioner, to this field.
We should not retain the internal mediation body proposed in the agreements, but follow the Commission' s initiative here.
We also need comparability of data.
The effective annual interest rate in particular is highly important for the consumer.
The figure at the end is not the only important thing, but the basis on which it is calculated, too.
The effective annual interest rate is still calculated in different ways in Europe. We should work towards getting a uniform method of calculation.
I would very much welcome it if this did not have to come from the Commission, but if the banks themselves could manage to agree on a method within a very short space of time.
We should then also apply all this to services offered over the Internet.
We have, after all, just had the Huhne report, which also said we wanted to press forward with this.
We should have this information there in future, too.
And finally, as the Huhne report recommends, future legislation should be harmonised with the legal terms used in this code.
In conclusion I would like to stress that I very much welcome this voluntary code of conduct.
It now requires critical appraisal and monitoring.
We hope the Commission will before long present the Committee with a report on how successful the code has been and whether we can continue along that road or whether we must introduce legislation.
Mr President, I express my sincere appreciation of Mr Radwan' s motion for a resolution regarding pre-contractual information for home loans.
There is no doubt that work to reorganise and tidy up this rather confused sector has now begun. Unfortunately, some debatable if not downright censurable behaviour has been seen on the part of European lenders.
The importance of the work that has been done lies essentially in the fact that for the first time a collection of indications and regulations is not the result of self-regulation, as has often happened in the past.
I refer to the inter-bank agreements on conditions, in which the banks dictated the rules more so as not to have to face fierce competition within the sector rather than to set up transparent contractual schemes to supply to the end-customers, but by means of an agreement, even though a voluntary one, between banks and consumers' associations.
Also important is the choice of transparency and publicity laid down in Articles 21, 22, 23 and 24 of the Code itself, and especially Article 25, which states that an offer made over the Internet should be made in accordance with the European scheme and in compliance with all the provisions and indications that are laid down.
In conclusion, I should like to point out that this code will require further additions and corrections.
The practical stage will be to give the necessary indications.
I am just troubled by the fact that the committee did not accept an amendment I tabled to set a limit - the total amount - on the loan to be registered.
My reason for this amendment was the fact that in some Member States the credit institutions triple the loan figure registered compared with the amount actually lent, which is doubly harmful to the consumer: first, there is a question of image, in that, to an inexperienced person the debt might appear to be three times as large as it really is; and secondly, a matter of costs, particularly notarial costs, which are calculated on the registered amount of the loan.
I hope that in future this aspect can be reconsidered.
Mr President, I want to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and thank him for his cooperation.
Completing the internal market for financial services and affording consumers a high level of protection is a Community priority.
Signing a home loan agreement is often the most important and the biggest financial obligation a consumer takes on in his working life.
We must therefore welcome the fact that a voluntary agreement has been reached at European level between banking and consumer associations on the duty to provide precontractual information.
That the code of conduct and the register of home loan providers to be kept by the Commission will also be made available on the Internet is also a positive move.
In this connection, in order to improve the comparability of consumer information, a precise definition of a common effective annual interest rate for home loans should be included in the European Standardised Information Sheet; it should be calculated in the same way throughout the Community and be consistent with the consumer protection directive.
The information sheet should be designed to include all the data needed to check how the loan is calculated.
This means, in particular, the manner in which advance and deferred interest is calculated.
That is one of the most important consumer policy concerns in this sector.
It is also desirable for Parliament to be included in talks about voluntary agreements in future so that absolute transparency can be guaranteed in drawing up the code of conduct.
I hope that this example of a voluntary agreement between market participants and consumer associations will prove successful so that it can be extended to other areas of financial services.
This will be a major contribution to the swift creation of the internal market in financial services.
But since the consumer side has relatively few resources available, concrete measures must be taken if the voluntary agreement is not kept.
Otherwise, the instrument of the voluntary agreement - a very good instrument in itself - might prove to be inexpedient because in the end the agreement is only kept by those who cause no problems anyway.
That alone would not be enough and would be of no benefit.
Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that the Commission is in a very comfortable position because it agrees entirely with the content of the resolution adopted almost unanimously on 28 August of this year by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The voluntary code of conduct which underpins the Commission's recommendation is the very first example of an agreement reached between banking and consumer associations on the standardisation of information which must be made available to consumers before a contract is concluded.
Its existence proves, as has rightly been pointed out in the resolution, that market participants are best placed to negotiate proper solutions and to ensure an appropriate balance of interests between contractual parties.
But however well placed they might be, market participants need a neutral and indefatigable broker to accompany, and sometimes remotivate them, during the long and difficult negotiations of this code.
Tribute has been paid by the rapporteur to the Commission's role and the Commission is duly appreciative and grateful to the rapporteur for that acknowledgement.
As agreed between and called for by all parties, the broker, that is, the Commission, will now transform itself into a notary and, if need be, into a referee.
As a notary, the Commission will, in line with the resolution, keep a register of home-loan lenders who adhere to the code.
That register will be kept up-to-date and made available online.
I say this in particular to Mr Radwan who wanted this code to be on the Internet and it will be.
It will be made available online on the Commission's website and appropriate transparency will therefore be ensured.
During the negotiation phase the lack of appropriate transparency was deplored in the report.
It is a point well taken by the Commission, but at least when the register is on the net then that transparency will be restored.
That is with the Commission as a notary.
As a referee the Commission will monitor compliance with its recommendation and assess its effectiveness.
The Commission made it clear in its recommendation that it will consider presenting binding legislation should the terms of its recommendation not be fully complied with.
Parliament will, as is rightly called for in the resolution, be closely informed - that also is a point that was raised tonight - about our monitoring and compliance-assessment work.
I am convinced that the code and our related recommendation will play a very significant role in the completion of the internal market for financial services to which Parliament regularly reiterates its support.
I am also hopeful, like the rapporteur, that this pioneer initiative, once again the first of its kind, will not be a one-off experience.
Its success will, however, depend on the commitment of all parties - and I am pleased to inform this Parliament that the number of companies having notified their adherence to the code is now already significant, although not entirely satisfactory in some Member States.
I can assure Parliament that the Commission will work hard in order to ensure adherence of the entire sector.
In conclusion, Mr Ettl has put forward certain wishes.
The Commission takes note of those wishes but would like to point out that this affair is restricted to precontractual information and therefore information on interest rates and so on is beyond the scope of this instrument.
So the Commission takes note of what Mr Ettl has just said but it does not see its way to complying with those wishes.
Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein, for your dedication to Parliament this evening.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)
Mr President, I would like to make a personal statement pursuant to Rule 122, which allows the speaker three minutes.
I shall not abuse the Rule.
Yesterday, an Italian news agency reported a letter sent to President Fontaine by Mr Tajani regarding the speeches made during the debate of the Extraordinary Council of 21 September by Mr Barón Crespo and myself.
First of all, I would ask you to check and find out whether the President received this letter.
In addition, I gather from the agency - because I have not read the letter - that our President is being asked to do something improper, which is to take an initiative in defence of the Italian Parliament.
I do not know with what prerogative the President of the European Parliament could do so.
I also assume that the Presidents of the Italian Parliament should be perfectly able to defend their own institutions.
I should like to make it clear, then, that neither Mr Barón Crespo nor I made any attack on that Parliament.
We did, however, point out what seemed to be extremely inconsistent behaviour on the part of the Italian Government, for, at Brussels, it did not submit any reservation when signing the action plan against terrorism at the close of the Extraordinary Council, nor did it raise any objection of the kind in the Justice and Home Affairs Council, and yet Italy is promoting a law which makes judicial cooperation much more difficult. The latter fact has been noted by prominent jurists, the international press and also, today, by the American judge, Mr Calabresi, head of the Court of Appeal in New York, who says that Italy is setting out in the opposite direction to that taken by the United States and the whole international community.
In any case, we freely expressed an opinion.
In the debate, Mr Tajani did the same, refuting these arguments with arguments of his own.
At this point, I frankly cannot see what our President should do other than uphold the prerogative of this Parliament, which, pursuant to Rule 2, guarantees the independence of the parliamentary mandate, and as neither I nor Mr Barón Crespo have violated any rule of behaviour laid down in the Rules of Procedure, I think Mrs Fontaine should do nothing.
It also seems odd to me that Mr Tajani should complain about alleged interference and then ask the President to do the same.
Having said that, I should like you, Mr President, to inform Mrs Fontaine that, before the end of this part-session, we would like to know if and how she intends to respond to Mr Tajani' s letter.
I shall, of course, inform the President of your request.
I am sure Mrs Fontaine will respond as soon as possible.
Mr President, a further personal statement.
I do not believe Mrs Fontaine needs lessons in parliamentary law to know what to do.
I refer to the letter that I sent to the President yesterday.
The agencies are not the source of the information, but rather the text of the letter that I sent to Mrs Fontaine to ask her if she thought it appropriate to intervene following certain statements made in this House by the President of the Socialist Group, Mr Barón Crespo and other members of the same Group.
I do not think I mentioned Mrs Napoletano in the letter, but I do not mind contesting some of her statements.
The problem is not one of interference of the European Parliament in the Italian Parliament; it is that yesterday and the day before, that is since the beginning of this part-session, we have heard statements repeated in this House that interfere with the Italian Parliament.
Indeed, when someone asks repeatedly to check whether the laws that are passed are in accordance with the decisions of the Council of Ministers, and nobody questions the assessment of that Council, I repeat and continue to repeat, and I said so yesterday to Mrs Napoletano and the Socialist Group, who had spoken on an issue that concerns Italy' s internal affairs - the Italian Parliament, thank God, is still sovereign and must not be subjected to guardianship - that, in connection with the rules on international letters rogatory, the issue in question is about a verification of a law ratifying the agreement between Italy and Switzerland, and the basic law is that which implements Article 3 of the European Convention on Legal Assistance signed in Strasbourg by all the European countries and which has been in force in Italy since 1961.
Article 3 lays down the obligation of the country that receives a letter rogatory asking for legal assistance to send the petitioning country the originals of the documents having evidential value or, failing that, a copy with a certificate of authenticity.
This is not a matter of failing to combat terrorism: we have always been, as a political grouping and as the national government, the expression of this political movement with its Prime Minister strongly committed to fighting terrorism.
I would not like it to be said, wrongly, in this House, that the law being adopted implementing Article 3 of the European Convention on Legal Assistance, which has all too often been violated by magistrates in Italy, is actually a law favouring terrorism, because it is not.
Hence my request for Mrs Fontaine' s intervention, if she thinks fit.
The matter is now closed.
General product safety
The next item is the report (A5-0313/2001) by Mrs González Álvarez, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on general product safety [3644/2001 - C5-0298/2001 - 2000/0073(COD)].
Mr President, I do not think I will take up the whole five minutes.
This is a third reading and it is a conciliation procedure that we have been following for a long time.
I would like to welcome the dialogue that has existed between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament, which has been very helpful.
Naturally, the result of a conciliation is never entirely good for all parties.
It is usually fairly good, but with a few drawbacks.
I believe that of the first amendments presented by the European Parliament at first reading, the other two institutions have accepted some important amendments.
For example, taking into account in product safety not only the producers' liability but also that of the distributors; clear information on the possible risks in the languages of the different States of the Union; faster exchange of information; greater cooperation between Member States to prevent dangerous products from reaching the market; and also, the withdrawal of products which are considered dangerous, even if they are already being marketed.
Furthermore, although not in the form that our colleagues from the United Kingdom wanted, an amendment aimed at including the special nature of several charities in the United Kingdom was accepted.
I believe that a major part of the European Parliament' s proposals were included.
However, not all of them were included, and at second reading we presented only seven amendments which intended to include what had not been accepted by the other institutions.
These amendments referred to something very important for us: the inclusion of the services in a proposal on which the Commission is working, the results of which it is committed to producing in 2003.
I believe this is a very important proposal for us, because safety of services should rank on the same level as the directive we are reviewing today.
We also need to take account of the precautionary principle; this means that when there is a well-founded suspicion that a product is not safe, we should apply this principle of precaution which people talk so much about and which is seldom applied in reality.
And the possibility that there is an external certificate which supplements the official certification.
There is also an agreement on comitology which in this case is not what Parliament wanted either, but there is a proposal of continued and regular information to the European Parliament and the Council.
Some matters which caused us concern in the final proposal were also clearly accepted.
I would just like to emphasise a matter proposed by the Commission itself at the beginning, which is the ban on exports to Third World countries of products which are not considered safe in Europe.
This proposal was not accepted by Parliament by a few votes, and is naturally not included in the final document.
I have to say, as rapporteur, that this is perhaps what concerns me most.
I believe that we run a real risk that, as we are seeing daily, unscrupulous people export to Third World countries products that are not safe.
This is an issue that is of enormous concern to me.
We have the verbal undertaking of the European Commission that there will be very strict controls to ensure that this does not occur, but it would have been safer for it to be included in the proposal and for there to be no risk of exporting products which we Europeans consider dangerous to Third World countries.
Therefore, Mr President, despite the rapporteur' s great regret that the express ban on the export of unsafe products to the Third World has not been included in the directive, I believe, as I said in the beginning, that it is not the best proposal for the Council and the Commission, perhaps it is not the best one for Parliament either, but it is the result of a conciliation procedure in which a very fruitful dialogue has indeed taken place between all the institutions and with which I am very satisfied.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the operation of the internal market is only guaranteed if, in an area without internal borders, appropriate and sensible measures are put in place and consumer safety is safeguarded.
We need uniform safety standards, not a range of different standards.
The proposal before us is intended to create these uniform standards.
In recent years, consumer confidence has been badly dented, firstly by various acts of fraud against consumers, and secondly by the very welcome research in this area.
This has repeatedly revealed that some consumer goods on the market no longer complied with current safety criteria.
It is therefore even more important and necessary that this report is before us today.
Our thanks are due to the rapporteur, whose efforts have made this possible.
It is very important that this general product safety directive should apply irrespective of the type of marketing undertaken, and that a decision is taken which reflects developments in the market place and therefore also includes distance marketing and electronic commerce.
As regards the issue of consumer safety, the task is not only to protect children and older persons as the weaker groups in our societies, which is always emphasised; safety standards must apply to everyone.
It is therefore only right and proper that we should seek to ensure that goods which no longer meet our safety standards and have to be withdrawn from sale do not end up by circuitous routes in third countries where they could pose a risk to health.
I think that one of the most important points arising in this context is the involvement of the trade.
Ensuring compliance with these current safety criteria cannot take place solely via the public authorities; the dealers themselves must play their part in ensuring that this relationship of trust between dealer and consumer is enhanced and improved in future.
However, this will still require appropriate controls, and the directive is only as good as its regulation.
Monitoring measures will therefore be very important.
This network of regulatory bodies in the Member States is essential, and we hope that it will come into operation as quickly as possible.
Let me add one final point, namely the speed of response by the European Parliament and the European institutions to this type of emergency and the consumer protection which had become necessary in the wake of the BSE crisis, foot and mouth disease, and other types of consumer fraud.
We have been discussing this issue for nearly a year now, and I think we should consider how we can respond to emergencies more quickly and introduce urgently-needed measures, and perhaps also how we can improve and, above all, speed up our internal processes and inter-institutional processes in this context.
Mr President, for those of us who have sat through the discussions in this conciliation, Mr Ebner's comments have come as a welcome and positive contribution to our deliberations.
For those of us who have to explain back home how this Parliament influences legislation, the timetable and content of the general product safety directive could be something of a model.
Progress here has been relatively swift; the Commission proposal submitted 15 months ago has now gone through every stage, with all of the three parts which make up the triangle of forces involved now having made their own distinctive contributions.
Secondly, as regards Parliament, there is the rapporteur.
Mrs González Álvarez has taken a consistent, thorough and dedicated line throughout the passage of this legislation through Parliament.
She has known when to hold firm and when to make concessions.
Those of us who have felt that occasionally we did not prevail when we should, owe it to her that the door is open for further and better changes after these initial steps.
Twenty-one of our thirty amendments have been accepted by the Council.
I am particularly grateful, in respect of the UK, for the clarified exemption for charity shops and street markets from the obligation to provide information on origin, which would have been beyond them.
This was not a Community-wide problem, but in countries like the Irish Republic and Britain it mattered very greatly, and much good has been done by the clarification provided.
We have the clear recognition now of the precautionary principle itself.
There was an uncommon delay before the other institutions were prepared even to write this into the preambles, but they have done so and it is now one of the markers which will guide us as we look at how product safety legislation develops.
We were not as successful as I would have wanted on withdrawal and recall, and we shall return to that and other matters later.
It is important that we should be required to consider the safety of services and to examine proposals to this end in reasonably quick time.
In this we were simply holding the Commission to a principle which it supported in theory, but must now deliver in practice by 2003.
At the same time, we shall have to look hard at the failure to ban the export of unsafe products to the rest of the world, as the rapporteur has said, and the nature of the safety indications which imported products have to carry.
One has only to look at the CE mark to see the imperfections there.
This was one step forward, but an important one.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
She has certainly earned our quality mark in these debates.
Mr President, I would like to express my support and that of my Group for the report from the Conciliation Committee.
I also congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs González Álvarez, who has done an excellent job.
The report before us makes for a significant improvement on current legislation governing the safety of products.
Of the points agreed, I particularly welcome the fact that stronger action can now be taken at Community level under the rapid alert system where there is a serious risk to consumers, so that dangerous products can be taken off the market.
It is important that we have adequate and independent certification to comply with the relevant product safety criteria and clear labelling for consumers.
The fact that the Commission will be reporting regularly to Parliament is significant, as is the reference to the precautionary principle and the duty of the relevant authorities in Member States to interpret this in relation to all products.
My Group believes that all consumers, both within and outside the European Union, should be treated equally.
As the rapporteur has stressed several times during discussions on this directive, safety should be assured for all consumers.
I am also glad that agreement has been reached on antique and charity shops and car boot sales, as by their nature they cannot provide information about second-hand goods but do provide a very valuable service.
Overall, we need a good balance between ensuring that products put on the market are safe and seeing to it that the measures proposed to that end can be implemented in practice.
This report partially achieves that and the consumer organisations which have welcomed earlier drafts of this directive will welcome this one, too.
Our top priority is to ensure that consumers are protected and that they have the right to know which products are dangerous and what is being done about them.
This report makes significant improvements to existing legislation and hopefully will have the support of Parliament.
Mr President, strong competition, increasing concentration and globalisation are now key features of manufacturing industry around the world.
This creates great advantages, but also disadvantages, for the consumer.
Although there are numerous institutions in the EU Member States which are responsible for quality assurance and consumer product regulation, product recall is unfortunately becoming far more common.
The purpose of this report is to enforce the precautionary principle in respect of any product placed on the market, and identify suitable approaches.
I myself am a producer of consumer goods and so I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur for her proposed solutions, for the task is to protect producers as well as consumers.
One option is to harmonise the regulations governing the authorities responsible for product safety.
The network of information which will be required in this context will be broad.
It is therefore appropriate to expand the existing directive first of all and revise it after a thorough appraisal of the situation.
The market cannot be regulated.
This is why preventive safety and health measures are especially important.
The report contains numerous references to the fact that in the Member States, operators' and producers' rights take precedence over the rights of consumers.
The purpose of the report is to change this situation.
I fully support this objective.
Due to the wide range of products available and the resulting risks to consumer safety and health, a new legislative approach is required.
The report makes no secret of this fact.
It also makes it clear that an export ban must be adopted for dangerous products.
This issue has yet to be considered in detail, and in my view, the proposed period until 2003 is not too long for this process.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the spirit in which Members have spoken in this House today, and also on previous occasions, over months and even longer, in addressing this issue. It is surely one of the issues which European and, I might say, world public opinion cares about most, as well as being one of the most important for Europe' s identity.
There are arguments on which Europe has intervened effectively but which do not receive the general support of public opinion and the citizens.
There are other, more specific and sector-based topics, on the other hand, which have received approval.
This, however, is a general topic which has received the general support of the citizens.
On reading the documentation relating to this procedure as a whole, on how it developed and how it is concluded today, I find a vagueness in many chapters and recitals, as well as in many expressions that are or will be binding on this subject.
It is a vagueness that is quite common in acts of the European Parliament, the Commission or the Council, but which, in this case, could perhaps have been more fully corrected.
My concern is not the delay in reaching the position that is emerging today in the report, but rather that more specific detail should be given regarding interventions, the form these take, controls and the procedures by which they are enforced, and the flexibility and dignity of the controls - in other words they should not be humiliating for the producer or the consumer.
I think that, in this sense, we could have been more specific and, at the same time, more respectful of the rights of producers and distributors, but always, of course, in the consumer' s interest.
For instance, I find that expressions such as 'dangerous' and 'serious risk' are insufficient; they could certainly be used in a standard or a regulation - at national or other levels - but, as these arguments are so delicate and liable to affect the daily lives of consumers and thus of society and the community, we could, perhaps, have been more explicit.
As for the future, bearing in mind what I have said regarding controls, I think that the three-yearly report required of the Commission should be drawn up at shorter intervals, without waiting three years, so as to prevent situations from arising over the three years that need to be remedied with specific provisions.
That is why I believe that this point may warrant further consideration.
Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate the Commission's endorsement of the outcome of the Conciliation Committee.
This directive recasts an existing directive of 1992, which has now been updated, reinforced and completed.
The overall aim of this directive is to impose a general obligation to market only safe products and to ensure both a consistent and a high level of protection of consumer health and safety throughout the EC and the proper functioning of the internal market.
Improvements in consumer health and safety represent one of the political priorities announced by this Commission.
The directive before you today is framed within the actions intended to achieve this objective.
Before us lies now the important task to ensure that the new provisions have full effect in practice.
Finally, let me again express my appreciation for your support and confidence in ensuring the rapid adoption of this important directive.
I hope it will be seen in coming years as a keystone of our efforts to ensure the safety of the European citizens.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Poverty reduction (combating the major transmissible diseases)
Mr President, a family in a mud hut in rural Africa without access to clean water, electricity, hospital or community centre is simply devastated when it discovers that a member of the family is suffering from any one of the three diseases HIV/AIDS, TB or malaria.
The patient has no access to a clinic nearby that can test, diagnose and treat him and, even if there is one, he cannot afford the treatment.
The patient's family is in crisis, not only because of illness but also because it has to find the money for treatment that will include the cost of transport and additional nutritional requirements.
This is the reality!
Therefore, my objective was to produce a report with recommendations that would support a programme of action that is possible to fund, practical to implement, and most beneficial to those who are the poor victims of such infections.
Such a report requires wide consultation with colleagues from all political groups, the European Commission, the pharmaceutical industry, UN agencies, NGOs and civil society, so that a consensus based on facts can be achieved and appropriate action taken to target the problem, making most efficient use of limited resources.
I had that wide consultation, and I want to thank all colleagues who were so helpful, in particular Dr Fransen and her team and Commissioner Nielson's department.
Dr Fransen has worked in Africa herself, so she was a mine of information.
I also want to thank all colleagues from all political parties, especially in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, related committees and, of course, the secretariats, who were extremely helpful.
The report promotes the following: a global fund financed by G8, the EU, oil-rich nations and others to finance access to and supply of medication and treatment; a global strategy to implement a programme of action to treat and prevent communicable diseases; tiered pricing of medicines from the pharmaceutical industry to ensure wide access to treatment; support for health infrastructure to scan, diagnose, treat and monitor patients, as supply of medicines in itself is inadequate; use of incentives - both financial and legislative - to enhance research and development to produce new medicines and vaccines by both industry and the public sector; the European Commission to work closely with the governments of developing countries, UN agencies, NGOs and civil society to implement the programme.
It promotes appropriate future legislation to give more flexibility in the implementation of TRIPS to encourage transfer of technology for local manufacture of essential medicines wherever this is viable.
There are four paragraphs in the report which require minor changes because of errors or difficulty in implementation.
My intention in paragraph 14 was to ensure that if we are to find the lowest prices for medicines for poor countries and for the patients in these countries, we must ensure that the developing countries do not impose import duty and taxes on imports of essential medicines.
Developed countries - the EU and the USA - do not impose export taxes when they export medicines from their countries.
So there is a mistake in paragraph 14.
I want to make an oral amendment, which I hope colleagues will accept.
It should read: "Calls on developing countries to abolish tariffs and taxes on imports of essential drugs and equipment in order to make health care more affordable;". This paragraph really refers to import taxes in developing countries.
I also want to make an oral amendment to paragraph 9 to replace "10%" with the word "appropriate", because you cannot dictate to the European Commission and the Committee on Budgets what exact percentage of money should be spent - there are budget lines, which are already agreed in other committees and in other reports.
So "appropriate" is the word, rather than "10%".
In paragraph 20, I would like to propose an oral amendment, which I hope Members of this House will support, to delete the second part which begins "in which a doubling of the budget ....".
Again, the same problem applies: you cannot in a report like this put a fixed percentage when other committees have agreed budget lines and the Commission has budget appropriations fixed by the Council of Ministers for doing the job it is doing.
These are minor changes.
Finally, I wish to clarify the issue of the patent life of medicines, as some colleagues have expressed concern.
A new drug costs about USD 500 m to research, test and bring to market.
Unless this sum is recoverable, nobody will invest in research and the development of drugs for diseases of the poor.
No government can finance such investment so we must encourage the pharmaceutical industry to continue to finance research.
Their patent is in any case irrelevant after seven or ten years as new drugs are developed and doctors will change a treatment regime, thereby precipitating the fall in price of that medicine still under patent.
The real trick - and this is what I have been trying to do in this report - is to secure tiered pricing for all medication - new and old - so that the poor patients benefit whilst the industry continues to pay for research and development.
My Amendment No 1 addresses this problem and I have inserted the word "review" to replace the word "reduce", in order to cooperate with colleagues concerned about this issue.
So I am not throwing it out of the window, I am asking us to review it in WTO.
If there is justification for amending it, so be it.
I hope that this House will give me full support for this report, which I did not try to make political.
It concerns something that we must do for the poor so that we can tell the world, especially the poor, that the European Union is concerned about their problems and will take the lead in fighting disease and poverty throughout the world.
Mr President, five million people die each year of AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in developing countries.
One of the reasons for this is that medicines are for the most part too expensive for the people of those countries.
And medicines are often unavailable altogether.
Of the more than 1 450 new medicines which have come onto the market in the last twenty years, only thirteen are intended for tropical diseases.
There is a severe lack of effective medicines in developing countries.
They are either non-existent or too expensive.
It would appear that investment in treatment of tropical diseases is not profitable enough for pharmaceutical companies.
A more tragic example of the failure of the market is hard to imagine.
These sad facts give the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy cause to propose drastic measures.
Firstly, we propose a system of differentiated pricing.
Medications should be made available free of charge or at affordable prices.
For this, it will be necessary to prevent re-importation, and the industry' s cooperation will be essential in this.
Secondly, there is the matter of patents.
Rapporteur Khanbhai mentioned the great importance of these.
Nevertheless, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy proposes to shorten the period of patent protection for essential medicines in developing countries.
This is important, since in 2005 and 2006, the TRIPS Agreement is to be implemented in developing countries.
By then, there will be major problems in combating AIDS and also tuberculosis.
If the system of differentiated pricing works, this measure will not be necessary.
But should it not succeed completely, it would be an important weapon in the battle against disease in developing countries.
A third point which is also of extreme importance to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is an extensive European research programme. This is necessary to tailor pharmaceutical research more to existing needs.
Therefore more research into, and investment in, treatment of tropical diseases, but also investment in remedies which can be used in developing countries. Remedies which, for example, do not require refrigerated storage.
Cooperation with the developing countries is essential, and a substantial increase in the budget to go along with this.
I thank the rapporteur for his cooperation and for his willingness to listen to other committees.
Mr President, the Commission' s initiative from last year to play a leading role in efforts to halt the spread of HIV, malaria and TB came not a day too soon - on the contrary.
The international community should long before have taken the HIV epidemic more seriously and generally gone to much more effort, through research and preventive measures, to reduce the spread of malaria in particular.
Lack of funds, especially in the area of research, has long been acute.
Of course, we welcome initiatives of the type which Bill Gates carried out, but this type of preventive work cannot, and must not, depend on the efforts of single individuals. It must primarily be a task for public bodies.
The resolution under discussion today constitutes Parliament' s rather late response to the Commission' s initiative of last year.
The resolution should be seen in the context of the work we are currently carrying out with regard to the budget for next year, in which we propose, at least on a preliminary basis, considerable increases compared with the proposals of the Commission and the Council.
We believe there is a need for more capacity within the Commission in order for it to be able to play a leading role in this area.
There is also a need for more money for operational initiatives.
The situation with regard to the diseases we are discussing here today is critical.
More resources are needed, but there is also a need for new and innovative forms of partnership - especially between the public and private sectors.
We must ensure that incentives are created for increased research.
Partnership between the public and private sectors is vital, as too of course is partnership with non-governmental organisations.
I hope the Commission, and especially Mr Nielson, will see this resolution, as well as our efforts in other contexts to increase budget resources, as a strong incentive and support for the Commission with a view to the latter' s playing the leading role in the fight against HIV, malaria and TB, a fight which I believe we all feel is so important.
Ladies and gentlemen, we should indeed welcome the Khanbhai report, which is the result of some excellent work in reaching a compromise between the various political groups and the rapporteur, and I would like to thank him for his effort.
This report reflects a twofold realisation, both of the extent of the scourge and that of the financial and human resources necessary to combat it.
It enables us to take several steps forward in a debate that is essential for the very survival of part of the world.
It also clarifies Parliament' s position on many crucial points such as the need to significantly increase resources assigned to improving health systems and to fighting communicable diseases in developing countries, the will to overcome the opposition between prevention and treatment, which are two essential and complementary aspects of the fight against disease, and the emergence of a new concept of public health as a global public asset. In addition, it clarifies and provides an interpretation of the safeguard clauses in the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property.
It also confirms the fact that the issue of the price of drugs is at the heart of the debates on access to treatment and the importance of research and development and, above all, it stresses the need to focus efforts on diseases that particularly affect the South, as well as forgotten illnesses.
The European Parliament' s position is therefore now clear and coherent, but, above all, it is just and fair.
There is the feeling that we are finally beginning to ask the right questions and, from now on, we need to provide the right answers.
It is now time, ladies and gentlemen, to make the move from good intentions to positive action.
In the immediate future, there are two main areas of action in which we need to intervene.
The first involves interpreting agreements on intellectual property in a way that is more favourable to the health of the developing world.
Public opinion is ready for such progress to take place and the withdrawal of actions brought against South Africa and Brazil has created a very distinct psychological climate.
Many ambiguities still remain, however.
The fourth WTO ministerial conference in Doha should enable us to go further in officially and formally proposing guarantees on recourse to all the components of the safeguard clauses established in the TRIPS agreement, confirming in particular that in the case of compulsory licences, drugs can be produced in third countries.
The second front on which we should expect short-term progress is the global AIDS and health fund that was launched in New York and Genoa.
An interim working group has been implemented. It will make proposals in the next few days.
The principle is therefore now established. We must insist, however, that this fund should start to operate in the coming weeks so that treatment gets to patients as soon as possible, and we must ensure that its statute and procedures are fair.
What does this mean in specific terms?
It means that the fund should be operational before 15 December, the deadline, so that the Commission can make its contribution to the 2001 budget, and so that the definitive structure of these funds and the composition of its statutory bodies respect the rule of equality between representatives from Northern and Southern States and also between the NGOs from these two areas.
It also involves, and I will end here, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, clarifications on the contribution of the European Union.
The Union committed itself in Genoa, as stated by Mr Prodi, to allocating a budget of EUR 120 million to the global health fund.
This amount is not currently entered under any budget item.
The Commission must confirm to us today that this amount will not come from and will not be deducted from other funds earmarked for development and that it is indeed an annual contribution that will be entered in the budget on the specific line from 2002.
I thank you in advance for including these particular details.
Mr President, what happened on 11 September does not reduce the need for development aid.
On the contrary. There is reason for calling upon all the EU countries to live up to their pledges in Gothenburg to increase their aid to the promised 0.7%.
The EU is most certainly the world' s largest donor region, but that does not say as much about our own efforts as about the deficiencies of others.
Even if we are not at present supposed to be criticising the United States but instead continuing to support them, it has to be said that the United States' role in this context has not been particularly distinguished, to put it mildly.
There is both their deficient contribution to the UN and the insufficient development aid they have provided.
The issue of their contribution to the UN has now been sorted out, so we can hope that the issue of development aid will also be sorted out.
Prevention is, of course, better than cure, and development aid is an effort at prevention.
It is sad that it is so easy to get expenditure on military systems authorised and that it is so difficult to get expenditure on the preventative work of development aid authorised.
We must be clear that, in our contemporary world with its TV channels, the very poorest people also know that there are very large inequalities in the world.
In reality, it is amazing that they do not react more strongly than they in fact do.
There is no doubt that the refugee ship we heard about this summer is only the first small portent of what is to come.
Following this introduction, I wish to turn to the rapporteur' s report and thank him for all the work he has put into this matter.
Crisis conditions, to put it mildly, prevail in a long list of developing countries.
A huge effort is therefore necessary when it comes to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
Anyone who has been in any doubt as to whether this can simply be left to private companies can no longer, after the debate that has been conducted in recent years, be in any doubt that an effort is required, partly from the donor countries.
We cannot leave this to the free market.
It has actually been rather humiliating to discuss this matter, but that is why it is all the more gratifying that the EU has now done something in this area and, for example, totally untied the funds, which means that developing countries can buy wherever it is best and cheapest to do so.
We must not only concentrate on medicine. We must, of course, also concentrate on restructuring.
It is incredibly important that we should ensure that people are helped to help themselves and that we should see to it that systems are devised for which developing countries themselves can take responsibility and which they can, above all, manage, including when we are not there to support them.
Both medicines and infrastructure are required in this matter, and I would urge us to continue to make a major effort to help developing countries to help themselves.
Mr President, given the millions of deaths in developing countries, the European Commission' s proposal for an action programme against communicable diseases in developing countries is a strong initiative that contributes to affirming the right to health on the international stage.
If the European Union wishes to play a distinguished role in this fight and to make its action have a real impact, public health must become a priority for its cooperation in developing countries, and therefore be actually reflected in its budget.
This is why we are opposed on this point to the rapporteur' s oral amendments.
This is a shame, because we have done a great deal of preparatory work with Mr Khanbhai, in order to strengthen his initial resolution, and the votes of the Committee on Development and Cooperation enabled us to achieve a broad consensus.
At the same time, the media coverage of the actions brought by the pharmaceutical industry and the United States against South Africa and Brazil, which produce or import generic anti-AIDS drugs, lifted the veil on the economic stakes and pushed the European Union to specifically commit itself to the side of those poor populations needing access to treatment.
Although it makes sense to tackle the fight against tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS in a single programme, we do, however, need to distinguish between the specific problems posed by these three diseases.
In the case of tuberculosis, although there is a vaccine for the prevention of this disease, its effectiveness is highly disputed and there is an ever-increasing amount of resistance to treatment.
There is no vaccine for malaria and although drugs to treat the disease are inexpensive, they are decreasingly effective due to increased incidences of resistance.
There is no vaccine for AIDS nor any treatment that is accessible to the people from the South, as the pharmaceutical laboratories that own the patents keep the prices at an exorbitant level.
Moreover, we regret that diseases such as filariasis, trypanosomiasis, sleeping sickness, the Ebola virus or various forms of diarrhoea are not the subject of the Commission' s communication as they are causing an ever-increasing number of deaths.
Effective and coherent action against these diseases should therefore offer different solutions depending on the case, but also combine measures on several levels.
First of all, prevention involves education and information campaigns, particularly aimed at at-risk groups, such as women and young people, conducted on the ground by influential local figures.
For the prevention of AIDS, therefore, promoting the use of condoms is a public health duty.
The best form of prevention remains the guarantee of good housing and working conditions, nutrition and health.
Development policy as a whole and all Community policies should therefore contribute to the key objective of improving public health.
In the same way, we need a more general discussion about the environment.
For example, by increasing the amount of stagnant water surfaces, damming policy has caused the number of parasite diseases to rocket.
Secondly, it is essential that we improve or even create health structures and train the staff required for the detection, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of these diseases.
The European Community development aid programme, specifically within the framework of the EDF, should be focused on health services, which have been neglected for too long due to budgetary restrictions imposed by structural adjustment.
The local health NGOs should be able to receive funds in order to carry out their day-to-day work of prevention and of supporting patients.
They should be involved in drawing up aid programmes in this field and be incorporated into public health action.
Thirdly, everyone should have access to treatment.
This means that medication should be sold at cost price to people in developing countries.
Another solution would be for these countries to have licences that authorise them to produce generic drugs. In fact, the only way to free the people of the South from the grip of the multinational firms on price fixing for drugs in the long term is to establish a regional or local pharmaceutical industry.
The TRIP agreements should be interpreted in the same fashion, and should reaffirm the right of developing countries to use compulsory licences in the event of a health emergency.
Pharmaceutical firms need to be made to respect human rights.
In fact, following the media pressure over recent months, some of them are taking a greater interest and have promised to reduce their prices.
These measures are isolated, however, limited to a few products for a few countries and will take time.
Moreover, they are still rejecting the principle of compulsory licences.
This rejection of compulsory licences forces us to question the duration of the protection of patents.
We could also ask ourselves whether a reduction in the duration of patents is not, after all, an excellent stimulant for research.
Fourthly, we need to give new impetus to research, and this is a fundamental point.
We need to find new preventive and curative treatments that are more effective, and more importantly better adapted to local populations.
For this purpose, an international research centre on Southern diseases, financed by public and private funds, would enable us to completely free research from the purely mercenary interests of certain manufacturers.
Finally, and this is what I believe to be the most important point in this debate, is the fact that we know that the very people in the South who are dying from these diseases are urgently waiting for our help, and have been for a long time.
I think that we should broadly develop all of these structures.
All these concerns have been largely incorporated into Mr Khanbhai' s report.
This is why we call on you to vote in favour of the report, and we hope that all of these speeches will for once not go unheeded, because the people of the South need us.
Mr President, as Mr Khanbhai' s report indicates very clearly, five million people die each year basically from these three contagious diseases and ten thousand people die each day in Africa.
This seems to me to be a silent genocide that is hardly mentioned in the international press.
It seems to me that some of the proposals in the report are very good, in the sense that these deaths will not be eradicated unless basic health services are available in each one of those countries and unless, as other Members have said, there is access to the treatments, to the medicines which can put an end to these illnesses.
At present, they are not available.
Therefore, the proposal for a Commission plan and also the proposal that we contribute to an international fund to fight against these diseases seems right to us.
However, I believe that we have to look into the deeper causes.
The rapporteur rightly indicates in paragraph 13 of the resolution the fact that demanding structural changes of these countries sometimes prevents them from using sufficient public funds for the health services.
It is an infernal vicious circle, because unless there are sufficient resources for these basic health services, for improving the people' s quality of life, for them to have access to housing, food and work, it will be difficult to eradicate these diseases.
It is a vicious circle that causes a very large part of the population of the Third World countries to be in this situation.
I believe, Mr President, that prevention, better quality of life for these people, access to medicines and access to a basic health service, as the report proposes, are essential elements for a solution.
The rapporteur also points out very clearly that it is necessary to increase development aid.
It is already more than twenty years since the United Nations proposed that 0.7% of the GDP should be allocated to development.
Today, only a few Nordic countries in Europe attain that 0.7%.
The majority of European countries do not reach 0.7%.
Some, like mine, do not give 0.25%.
It is deplorable, because this development aid is vital precisely for these populations to be able to access basic health services.
I would like to end, Mr President, by recalling the multiplier effect that the participation of women may have in each of these programmes.
As a member of the delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, I was involved in projects financed by the European Union and I could see how the participation of native women in that zone had a multiplier effect, because women can help their daughters and their fellow women to learn.
Therefore, the participation of women in these plans to eradicate these diseases is fundamental.
Mr President, it is now already a year since I took part in the round-table conference on 29 September, in which everyone agreed that no time was to be wasted in obtaining practical results in the fight against transmissible diseases.
Since then, however, nothing much has happened.
The Commission has acknowledged the right of poor countries to issue compulsory licences, but what does the Commission intend to do to bring about the necessary transfer of technology so that poor countries themselves can produce medicine?
Why have we not yet seen initiatives to enable African technicians in African factories to produce medicines to combat tuberculosis, malaria and HIV?
Economically speaking, this is possible.
We are not talking in terms of huge investments to start up local production.
The necessary transfer of technology might, in addition, be envisaged in terms of allowing those employed in the medical sector in the EU to spend a couple of years in developing countries, working on such technology transfer programmes.
It is crucial to improve the skills of doctors, scientists, nurses and technicians in the poorest countries.
They must be involved in research and development, not by inviting them to European conferences - where they are likely to receive subsistence allowances - but by providing the institutions in which they work with equipment, training and communication facilities so that well-educated people living and working under incredibly difficult conditions are motivated to remain in their own countries.
Five malaria vaccines have now been developed - an extremely important step, given the fact that malaria is the disease that kills most people.
And what is the EU doing?
True, we have plans to set up a European platform to test the vaccine, even if there is already a fully developed African platform.
Does it not make sense for the vaccine to be tested by Africans in Africa, or are Africans only good enough to act as subjects of experiments by European scientists?
Let us forget all about setting up this European Clinical Trials Platform and instead support the pan-African network, AMVTN, which is just about to be converted into a fund.
It would save a huge amount of time and thus save millions of human lives, and it would save money.
It would also show that we recognise other people' s right to take charge of their own destinies, and it would provide them with the necessary transfer of technology.
It would be a fantastic first step on the way to taking action.
We have heard enough fine, but empty, words.
I should like, then, to thank Mr Khanbhai.
Mr President, despite global growth over recent decades, progress remains inadequate and unequally distributed.
Poverty, injustice and appalling conditions, from both a social and a health point of view, are still the bitter reality for many developing countries.
Thirty per cent of the world' s population live in conditions of extreme poverty, a situation exacerbated by continuous population growth and the inadequacy - or, rather, the decline - of policies for development aid, assistance and cooperation.
Europe is a relative exception, but not to the extent of correcting a worldwide downward trend.
New challenges in the developing world, such as urbanisation, environmental degradation and pollution, local warfare and the scourge of AIDS, together with the previously unthinkable resurgence of malaria and TB, threaten to drive us back.
In general, I am suspicious of statistics, which all differ, anyway, between the various Directorates-General of the Commission, as we have seen, and not uncommonly seem subservient to ideological prejudices.
There is no doubt, however, that the explosive growth of the richest countries has left the poorest countries even farther behind.
Among the indicators of poverty, that of women' s poverty stands out: the majority of poor people, the poorest of the poor, are women, just as most illiterate people are women and women continue to work more and to earn and count for less.
It would be difficult to deny or underestimate the importance of the link that still persists between poverty, disease, illiteracy and population growth, a link which has its most obvious proof in the scale of women' s poverty, the suffering of women and gender inequalities.
On the other hand, the reports of both the Commission and Parliament seem to me to be evasive, not to say reticent, on the subject of population.
The reports concentrate on the fight against AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, going at length into sophisticated technical analyses and proposals for reforms, which may serve to improve our measures for combating poverty - especially on the question of drugs and health services - but do not propose any measures to improve the effectiveness of policies on population control, healthy and sustainable fertility, or free and informed maternity, as if this subject had disappeared from our view.
Yet this is still the crucial issue.
Let us consider the facts: in purely numerical terms, never have so many people been torn by poverty as this year.
Yet, because of the continuing population growth, today there are more poor people in the world than all those that have ever lived throughout history.
Since the end of the last century, the world population has grown fourfold, from one and a half billion to six billion.
The greatest growth has been in Asia: India, China, Indochina and, in particular, Indonesia.
The population trend in the rich countries is, conversely, now stationary, but the balance achieved depends on a longer life expectancy, which makes up for the slump in the birth rate.
Africa, in turn, has seen a population explosion, mainly due to the fall in infant mortality.
This trend seems today to be more contained, not because population policies have been successful but because of epidemics, especially, as has been said, of AIDS, TB and malaria.
Africa challenges us and moves us, but Africa is not the whole world and is itself diverse in its various parts. It certainly has more need than any other region of a population policy more concerned with the condition of women.
Throughout the rest of the world, not only in the rich countries, population growth has slowed down somewhat over recent decades, but if you look more closely you will see both that the birth rate has fallen and that life expectancy has increased, and that means a population that is continuing to grow and which, in most situations, is ageing, as well as cases of overpopulation in certain regional and local areas.
In conclusion, if we want to be more effective in fighting poverty, we cannot avoid or ignore the matter of population control.
It is true that it is linked to economic and cultural growth, but we are not without suitable tools and appropriate experience in the field of prevention and contraception.
History teaches us that there has never been so much growth and so much poverty.
Experience shows that it is no use trying to dry out a flooded room without turning off the taps.
Mr President, Mr Khanbhai has produced a balanced report, whose proposals we gladly lend our support to.
The report draws specific attention to the triangle of poverty, health and education, no part of which can be ignored without action in the other two areas coming to nothing.
Poverty has sometimes been compared to war: it takes prisoners and it kills.
The only difference is that death from poverty is slow and the victim him/herself is branded as the culprit.
I therefore also want to remind our Member States of the 0.7% target, to give some credibility to our calls for altruism in the pharmaceutical industry.
I would particularly support the establishment of a global infectious disease fund and the introduction of compulsory licences to improve the availability of medicines.
Both will take great initiative on the part of the EU and their successful implementation will require the goodwill of key global movers and shakers as well as institutions.
In any action taken, however, it has to be borne in mind that, without viable basic health care, no other developments are possible.
Good basic health in itself also prevents more dangerous infections, and it makes it easier to identify infections early on and stop them if basic health care has been provided for.
We must not forget the importance of people' s attitudes: if there is not even any functional basic health care in place, apathy grows and then people cannot in all fairness be asked to take seriously infection risks that might develop into fatal illnesses in the years to come.
No matter how fearful the prospects of communicable disease are, making us feel a spontaneous need to take specific action as a consequence, it should never be done at the expense of basic health care.
It can, therefore, be said with some justification that EU aid with regard to basic health care has been totally inadequate for a long time now.
For that reason, doubling the EU' s financial aid resources for basic health care can be considered to be the most essential matter from the point of view of all the other objectives.
We should bear in mind the Copenhagen Social Summit pledge to attain universal and equitable access to primary health care.
Mr President, I should like to begin by commending both the Commission communication and Mr Khanbhai's report.
Access to medicines will be a key issue at Doha in a few weeks' time simply because developing countries feel hugely disadvantaged by rules which are applied universally, even though countries are of unequal strength, both economically and institutionally.
They will be calling clearly for the TRIPS Agreement to be applied fairly.
The global spotlight, therefore, will be firmly on the role played by pharmaceutical companies in the HIV/AIDS catastrophe.
Only 0.1% of the 25 million people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa have access to lifesaving drugs or indeed for the drugs for the opportunistic infections such as meningitis, drug-resistant diarrhoea, oral thrush and those other infections.
There are now alternatives - cheap copies of life-saving medicines.
In Brazil, Thailand and India their laws allow them to ignore drug patents.
In India for instance, companies are marketing a drug for the treatment of that drug-resistant diarrhoea, at 1.8% of the price charged in Pakistan where only the patented version can be bought.
Four years ago Brazil waived the patent rights on HIV drugs and allowed local companies to produce cheap versions.
Prices in Brazil have fallen by 80% and they have halved the number of deaths from HIV/AIDS.
I come to the point made by Mr Khanbhai on research and development.
If so much commitment is made by the pharmaceutical companies to R&D, how come they actually spend twice as much on marketing as they do on research and development?
According to the UNDP's recent figures less than 10% of global spending on health research addresses 90% of the global disease burden.
Of the 1223 new drugs marketed between 1975 and 1996, only 13 of those drugs were developed to treat tropical diseases and only 4 of those 13 were the result of the pharmaceutical industry's research.
And why is it that they charge more for the same drugs in Africa, than they charge in the northern hemisphere?
I would argue that these facts very clearly speak for themselves.
They have - and this is a very important point to make and it will be made in Doha - a virtual monopoly which means that they can control prices.
They are virtually saying "no" to cheap, affordable generics for very sick people in poor countries.
Globalisation is meant to be about freer markets and about increased competition.
The big four pharmaceutical companies act like a cartel: they bully developing countries and they deny them their rights to those drugs.
During the Uruguay Round they secured agreement on patent rights for 20 years.
The TRIPS Agreement was a clear example of the powerful vested interests of the developed world at this time.
All this threatens the whole credibility of the World Trade Organisation and any chance we have of believing in the developments at Doha, or if we ever have a new round of fair, multilateral trading systems.
There is now a clear need for a clear and new interpretation of TRIPS allowing for the flexibility which clearly exists in that agreement.
We need to ensure that it is the interests of poor countries that are put first.
This is an issue of fundamental social justice.
Mr President, it is unacceptable that millions of people continue to die unnecessarily from AIDS, malaria and TB.
We have here a global problem of the highest order.
Our own citizens who are HIV positive are able to access long-term treatment with effective medication.
For patients in developing countries, the medicines are too expensive and the medical infrastructure to provide care for them is lacking.
Also, if a patient is not disciplined in taking his medicines regularly and in the correct dosage, they lose their effect.
The pharmaceutical industry only lowered its prices under the heavy pressure of global public opinion, and those prices are still far too high.
A further lowering of prices must be realised through industrial and government cooperation.
Only a very broadly established, very expensive and dogged international campaign can effectively tackle this large-scale problem.
Mr Khanbhai' s excellent report provides a clear overview of all the important aspects of the transmittable disease.
We join him in welcoming the European Union' s campaign programme. It is well thought out and deserves to be carried out with the greatest urgency.
May I ask the Commissioner whether he has sufficient personnel resources available for this?
I advocate a very substantial provision in the budget over the coming years for the AIDS fund, without detriment to present provision for poverty relief.
Does the Commissioner consider this feasible and can he also tell us the situation regarding the setting up of the fund?
It is also a requirement that the twenty-year patent protection term specified in the TRIPS Agreement be considerably reduced for essential medicines.
The pharmaceutical industry must, of course, be able to continue investing in research into vaccines and cheap medicines, but must gain its profits in the rich countries and not in the epidemic-ridden Third World.
Results will not be achieved without large-scale information campaigns.
Sexual behaviour and attitudes towards women, in particular, will have to change dramatically.
Women' s right of self-determination is fundamentally at issue here.
A great responsibility also rests with the developing countries themselves, not only with the governments and the NGOs, but especially with the religious leaders who can wield moral authority.
If they refuse to cooperate, they will be partly responsible for the misery.
Only a collective effort can end the situation whereby millions of our fellow humans die, countless children are orphaned and economies are ruined needlessly.
Members of the Lutte Ouvrière party will vote in favour of this report, despite its shortcomings, due to the realistic account it gives of the catastrophic situation in poor countries and the few limited, yet positive, measures that it proposes.
It is appalling when we take account of the fact that three communicable diseases are killing five million people per year in poor countries and ten thousand people per day in Africa alone and that, moreover, the number of victims is increasing.
This is very true in the case of AIDS, where there is no known cure, whereas there are cures available for tuberculosis and malaria.
Despite this, malaria, which a few years ago appeared to be on course for total eradication has, as the report highlights, become the main cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, whilst tuberculosis, for which there are simple and effective treatments, continues to be the disease most widespread throughout the world.
The cause of this situation is simple.
Drug manufacturing is monopolised by large pharmaceutical corporations, whose prime concern is not public health, but profit.
The recent ignominious action brought by certain pharmaceutical corporations against South Africa is characteristic of this intolerable situation, even though public opinion did, to a certain extent, cause these corporations to back off.
The report' s proposal that aims for the European Union to recognise on the international level the right of developing countries to produce and sell generic drugs within their countries, without costs resulting from intellectual property rights, is the least we can do.
Another example of this would be to impose specifications on the pharmaceutical corporations obliging them to produce drugs for these diseases, which the report says are neglected by the industry because they are not profitable enough.
The report limits itself to mentioning a reduction in prices.
Millions of people in poor countries will only be able to have access to minimum treatment if certain drugs, particularly malaria drugs, are free of charge.
The report tries to reconcile the protection of patents with access to healthcare in developing countries; we reaffirm that industrial patents, and more specifically those patents involving the pharmaceutical industry, should be completely abolished. They do nothing to protect the intellectual property of the inventor, they only serve to guarantee the corporations a monopoly position and therefore the enormous profits that they earn to the detriment of public health and life itself.
The heading of the report says that the fight against infectious diseases contributes to poverty reduction.
In fact, most of these diseases are diseases related to poverty, even to malnutrition.
Only an improvement in people' s standard of living would be effective in eradicating most of them.
Having said this, however, for the benefit of the advocates of the market economy and capitalism, the simple fact that it is organically incapable of providing the most basic treatment and daily food for a considerable proportion of humanity in the twenty-first century, even though it has scientific and material possibilities like never before, irreparably condemns it.

President, in many European countries, at any rate in the Netherlands, there have been drastic changes in healthcare in recent years. More differentiation, more individual care, increased personal choice and especially improved efficiency have been the most important aims.
Often these changes give rise to criticism, especially where the general availability of healthcare is concerned.
To many of us, it is unacceptable on principle that a higher place on the waiting list should be for sale.
This would mean that a person' s health would be governed by his income.
And we do not want that.
It is all the more remarkable that the above situation is simply the harsh reality throughout the world.
Indeed, the Commission proposals under discussion today demonstrate that the availability of adequate medicines to the poorest, despite repeated promises, still leaves much to be desired.
There is much less indignation in the West concerning this.
In a world of increasing globalisation, however, we cannot shirk our international responsibility.
Our own healthcare problems are dwarfed by those of the majority of the world' s population.
I therefore support the measures proposed.
We will have to operate on two levels to combat these diseases.
In the first place, by participating on a micro level in healthcare improvement projects.
As far as I am concerned, these projects could be funded and executed via bilateral channels.
The European Union could play an important role with larger infra-structural projects which involve NGOs from several Member States.
In the second place, by creating on a macro level the necessary conditions to facilitate those projects on a micro level.
Policy direction is an important instrument here.
I particularly welcome, therefore, the paragraphs on the TRIPS and the WTO in the European Parliament' s resolution.
Especially since they provide the European Union with an important task.
I only need to see a concrete reference to the forthcoming meetings in Qatar.
I hope that the Commissioner responsible will nevertheless carry out our recommendations at that conference.
Mr President, in the North people think it is all over where AIDS is concerned.
It is not, of course, but changing lifestyles and the arrival of effective drug regimes have, at least, helped us turn a corner on the long road that we walk.
The forecasts when I was health minister fighting these issues were not the same as the forecasts now.
But in the South the picture is very different.
Ninety-five per cent of the five million new cases every year are in low-income countries in the South.
There are 25 million people living with AIDS in Africa and 6 million in the new-growth area in Asia - South and Southeast Asia in particular.
Where AIDS is concerned we face a vicious cycle of infection, incapacity and poverty alongside the 16 million deaths we have already seen: two million deaths a year in Africa, a quarter of all Africa's deaths.
Ten per cent of people between fifteen and fifty years of age are living with AIDS, and there are 10 million orphans.
The people who expected to be looked after in their old age are now unable to have that care and support because their children are dead.
That is the scene confronting us.
When The Economist went to Zambia and looked at a particular hospital, it saw two-thirds of the patients there dying of AIDS.
People's limbs, they reported, looked like broken broomsticks.
When they were asked what they were desperate for, they did not say retroviral drugs, they said food, because they were too poor to be able to afford either.
Poverty hastens death, and deaths accelerate the survivors' descent into poverty.
In Zambia the department of health then estimated that half the population would die of AIDS.
That is a human disaster.
We are facing human disasters in America now.
The world is looking at the headlines, the world is taking action, governments are coming together, people are demanding and subscribing to solutions.
But they are not doing that where AIDS, TB and malaria are concerned.
It is not terrorism, but it is a health terror and horror that is preventable.
That is why the honourable Member's report is so important and fundamental.
I congratulate him and the Commission on the work that has been done on this matter and everyone who has participated.
Poverty reduction goes hand in hand with the war against disease, disability and death.
We desperately need more resources for drugs and vaccines, but must also ensure their adequate distribution to people, so that drugs do not sit in storage deteriorating.
We must have adequate education, monitoring and research.
It has rightly been said that research should be conducted in Africa, by Africans, for Africans and, where appropriate, with the support, cooperation and partnership of the Western world, along the lines of the IAVI initiative between Oxford and Nairobi.
TB too, of course, is a killer.
It accounts for two million deaths a year, 95% of them in developing countries; it is the leading cause of HIV deaths; one infected person can pass it on to ten others.
Malaria is the third killer; 90% of deaths from Malaria occur in Africa - one death every 30 seconds.
In the past four minutes, eight people have died from malaria.
I want us and the Commissioner to keep those people who are dying of these diseases in mind and see what we can do.
The honourable Member has provided the words in this report; now it is time for the Commission to act.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the common feature of all the statements made in this debate so far is the belief that investment in healthcare is extremely worthwhile and is an important way of achieving sustainable development and combating poverty, which are two objectives of European development policy.
It is a proven fact that countries with a high standard of health and generous investment in this area achieve higher levels of development, including economic development.
Some of us have already observed that we must persuade the governments in these countries to spend more on this area of healthcare and education, and I naturally underline this political demand as well.
Yet it would be cynical in the extreme if we failed to point out that the structural adjustment programmes which must be undertaken by these countries to secure loans and funding from the international financial institutions now require them to spend less on prevention, public health and education.
One point which is very important, in my view, is the involvement of women in devising birth control programmes and other reproductive health campaigns.
Women - and I am not saying anything new - are extremely vulnerable to poverty.
Furthermore, as the HIV/AIDS infection rates in southern Africa show, women are also affected by this disease to a far greater extent than men.
Finally, I should like to say a few words about one of the most pressing issues addressed in the Khanbhai report, namely the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).
I believe that in future, too, the European Union must assist the developing countries to benefit from the opportunities already afforded by the TRIPS agreement.
Naturally, this is set forth in the provisions of the TRIPS agreement, but has not always been accepted by the pharmaceutical industry, as the case of South Africa shows.
In my view, the proposal outlined in paragraph 41 of the Khanbhai report on reducing the period of patent protection is essential.
I believe that when we talk about poverty, we must also identify tangible measures for the reform of the WTO.
Otherwise, we will also lose credibility.
As many of the previous speakers have pointed out, it is high time we took practical steps in this direction.
Mr President, in 1979, Willy Brandt presented his famous "North-South Report, a programme for survival", in which he warned of the risk that in the year 2000 a large part of the population would continue to live in poverty.
Shortly after that pronouncement some frightening statistics were published; every 24 hours, 35 000 human beings died of hunger in the world.
In two years, hunger caused more deaths than the two world wars put together.
The year 2000 arrived and the situation has only got worse.
According to the World Health Organisation, extreme poverty - misery - is the chief cause of suffering in the world and is also the one which each year claims the greatest number of human lives and yet we are still talking about poverty and how we are going to remedy it.
A few months ago, before the summer, at our Brussels headquarters, the United Nations together with the EU organised the Third Conference on the Least-developed Countries dedicated in particular to analysing the causes, consequences and solutions of poverty.
We also set an ambitious target: to reduce poverty by half by the year 2005.
Some studies lead to the conclusion, Mr President, that by what we are doing, with the plans and projects we intend to carry out and above all, with the resources we allocate and those which are intended to be allocated, that objective cannot be met.
Our concern now is to combat the international terrorism fostered by some notorious fanatics.
True, that is the problem of the moment but, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the root of the problem.
The problem is poverty throughout a large part of the world.
Until we solve the problem of poverty, especially the extreme poverty - misery - in which hundreds of millions, around 1 500 million human beings, and I am using cautious figures, live, we will continue to be exposed to situations such as those we are experiencing now.
Between 13 and 19 September some of us were visiting some of the poorest regions of the planet, in the south of the African continent.
Mozambique today has 19 million inhabitants but within 9 years only 13 million will still be alive; the remaining 6 will have died of Aids.
Today Mr Khanbhai in his report proposes a series of measures to combat Aids, malaria and tuberculosis in the context of reducing poverty.
During a visit to a field hospital way out in the middle of the African savannah, my colleagues and I witnessed how victims of a cholera epidemic are dying - believe me, right now - in a Dante-esque spectacle such as occurred in Europe in the Middle Ages.
This is also happening at other hospitals which are not in the middle of nowhere.
In Mocuba, there is a provincial hospital where women give birth next to patients with Aids, tuberculosis, leprosy, meningitis, and infectious diarrhoeas of all kinds.
For all these diseases which today can be cured and eradicated, there are drugs.
It is a problem of resources, and above all, it is a problem of political will.
Mr Khanbhai, I congratulate you and thank you for the important contribution you have made in your report.
But, Mr Bashir, you know your native Africa better than I do.
Let us make no mistake, the problems of poverty in the world are today of such magnitude that these measures, with the present resources, are like a drop in the ocean.
Some day we will realise this.
Either we fight against poverty with all our energy and all our resources until we conquer it, or poverty with its many faces - now taking the form of terrorism - will conquer us.
Mr President, others have established the need for action.
I should just like to add one fact: in the UK and Europe drugs cocktails have decreased AIDS deaths by 75%, in sub-Saharan Africa, where two-thirds of all people infected with HIV live, only one person in a thousand receives drug treatment.
Education is crucial to prevent people being infected with HIV in the first place, but access to drugs really does make a difference.
The drug companies are our partners.
But it is crucial that they act with integrity.
I will never forget the representative for SmithKline Beecham sitting in our EU/ACP Joint Assembly in Brussels, banging the table and saying that they had lowered the prices of essential medicines.
And then later in the year Mr Nielson was told they were going to lower them all over again.
Which is the lowest price - the one they told us in the spring, or the one they told us in the autumn?
I went to Gabon and South Africa and met doctors who are desperate to use those drugs, who have read the Internet press releases saying that the prices have been brought down; yet when they ring up they cannot actually acquire the drugs to treat those patients.
I have asked SmithKline Beecham what is the genuine, long-term cost of production of these drugs.
They will not say.
I have asked them how long they will commit themselves to these lower prices.
They will not commit themselves.
I have asked them why, if they are seeking a partnership with developing country governments, they face legal action, not just in South Africa but in India, Brazil and elsewhere.
They just will not answer.
We send a clear message to the drugs companies in this resolution: prices are too high and legislative action, including compulsory licensing in cases of national emergency, is needed to deal with it.
Finally, to Mr Khanbhai, it is no good claiming that you are seeking consensus, including NGOs for example, and then putting forward your Amendment No 1, opposing a reduction in patent protection.
Name one NGO which supports that position.
I will always remember that SmithKline Beecham's key anti-retroviral drug was not brought onto the market because of privately-funded research.
It was publicly-funded research.
They used a dormant patent to acquire that protection for their own commercial gain.
Let us have some clear speaking in this debate.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, 7000 people died in the wake of terrorist atrocities in New York and Washington and the global response was one of shock and horror, followed by a flurry of diplomatic activity and detailed planning for an adequate response.
In Africa, 10 000 people die every day from AIDS, malaria or tuberculosis.
Why is there not a similar response?
Regrettably, the harsh truth is that the developed world does not place the same value on human life in Africa.
It is a terrible indictment on all of us who live in the world's richest countries that this scale of human tragedy continues to occur into the 21st century.
Several years ago malaria seemed close to being eliminated, today it is the most common cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa.
Tuberculosis is the most prevalent disease in the world, and 35 million people are infected with AIDS, with half of all new HIV infections occurring in the 15-24 year-old age group.
I acknowledge that the EU Commission contributed EUR 4.2 billion for health assistance during the 1990s.
However, as the rapporteur pointed out, although EUR 700 million were allocated for health in 1998, the amount for 1996-1998 was only 4% of the total EU development budget.
This indicates how low down it has been on the list of our political priorities.
I hope this will now change with the publication of the new policy framework by the Commission and its proposed programme of action for the years 2001-2006.
Its three-prong strategy of better deployment of existing resources, increasing the affordability to people in poorer countries of key drugs, and support for more research is indeed welcome.
However, the proposals need to be developed further and underpinned by a greater financial commitment, indicative of a greater political priority.
The best means of achieving this is by taking on board the excellent proposals put forward by the rapporteur, Mr Khanbhai.
His call for the EU to devote 10% of our development aid to tackling this problem, his emphasis on preventative action with the 15-24 year-old age group in relation to AIDS, and his proposal for a global fund for infectious diseases and the establishment of an EU research agency should be the cornerstone of any new EU policy in this area.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, HIV and AIDS are not only a health policy problem, but a general social problem.
This has been made quite clear during today's debate.
A holistic strategy is therefore required to combat them. Tackling poverty is one approach, but I would like to focus on other priorities which I believe are equally important: information and education, prevention, and of course treatment.
These are the three areas which must be considered if we want to make progress, particularly in Africa, where the problem is most acute.
This means providing information and sex education for children and young people, for without a change in sexual behaviour, the problem cannot be mastered.
A proportion of the available resources must therefore be allocated for this purpose too.
The sexually active population must have the opportunity to practise prevention.
I should particularly like to mention Senegal as a positive example, where religious and political leaders have worked together to halt the spread of AIDS through prevention.
A similar approach has also been adopted in Uganda.
If politicians and a country's spiritual leaders work together on this issue, a great deal can be achieved.
The Côte d'Ivoire, for example, has therefore appointed a Minister for AIDS and HIV.
I believe that these are models which deserve our support.
There is another important problem, which is how to prevent the sick from being ostracized.
This is a major problem.
We must dismantle social taboos and not only ensure that those who are living with infection receive the medication they need, but also encourage their positive integration into society.
This is the only way to create a climate which ultimately halts the spread of disease in a holistic way.
Mr President, on a point of order, when the Commissioner quotes the WHO Essential Medicines' List he knows that includes not just essential medicines, but the affordability of those medicines.
Therefore, the very medicines we are discussing are excluded from the list in question.
Mr Howitt, you can communicate it in writing, thank you.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at noon.
Madam President, I believe you have been told about the discussion which took place in the House this morning at the opening of the sitting.
It is not my intention to reopen the discussion, because I am sure that Vice-President Imbeni will have mentioned the matter to you.
We are looking forward to your answer, after voting time, if you prefer, because I imagine all the Members wish to vote.
Mrs Napoletano, I was indeed told about your speech at the beginning of the plenary sitting this morning.
However, you referred to a letter that Mr Tajani had sent to me.
I have not yet been able to read the translation of his letter, which I received towards the end of the morning, as the letter had to be translated and that was difficult to do overnight.
Of course, I will only be able to take a position when I have had the opportunity to read the letter that Mr Tajani sent to me.
I therefore give him the same answer: I am sorry.
It deals with a very delicate problem, that of the possible limitations on the freedom of expression of heads of State, Commissioners and Members of Parliament, which is a very serious problem.
Be assured that I am going to give it all the attention that the problem deserves.

Wurtz (GUE/NGL).
(FR) Madam President, I would like to know if it is possible for each group to very briefly explain how it voted on this draft regulation.
I am sure you will understand.
This is an agreement that has been reached between all the groups.
Madam President, I would simply like to say that, of course, it goes without saying that my group is, completely and unequivocally, firmly opposed to terrorism and, therefore, in agreement with the principle of the Commission' s proposal of depriving these terrorist organisations of their funds.
However, my group finds the method imposed on us unacceptable, in other words, having to decide urgently on a list that was sent to us by the United States without explanation...
... and which could be changed outside our control.
This is why we cannot, unfortunately, approve this draft regulation as it is today.

Madam President, I would like to declare an interest in the subject of this report.
Before the vote on recital H
Madam President, I request that the rapporteur and all the Members accept the following oral amendment with a view to replacing the original text of recital H with the following:
Whereas an urgent review of the "Television without frontiers" Directive is necessary.
It is more precise, more accurate and has the same meaning.
I request your acceptance.
Are there any objections to the inclusion of the oral amendment tabled by Mr Aparicio?
President, as a rights holder I have a financial interest in television.
I will not partake in the vote today.
Are there any other colleagues who wish to say this?
If so, I invite them to do so now.
That would be in my interest as well.

Before the start of the vote
Madam President, there is a mistake in the Spanish text, paragraph 6, with reference to the word 'parents', which should come before primary and secondary schoolteachers.
I hope that translation will be corrected in the Spanish text.
Although there is widespread support for some other oral amendments which I was going to make, I understand there is opposition from the Greens so the only oral amendment that I wish to make now concerns paragraph 14.
There is a genuine error and it should be amended to read, 'Calls on all developing countries to abolish tariffs and taxes on import of essential drugs and equipment in order to make healthcare more affordable.'
There is no tax when we export medicines from Europe or the United States, so the current paragraph is factually incorrect.
I hope Members will support this.
(Parliament indicated its agreement with the tabling of the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, I was somewhat surprised that, prior to voting on the Council' s Regulation on the combating of international terrorism and the freezing of funds of terrorist organisations, we did not allow all the parties one minute' s speaking time to outline their standpoint.
Indeed, it was agreed earlier with all the political parties that we would discuss this prior to voting in view of the urgency with which the material was presented and since we had no time for a debate.
It is a very important matter.
I therefore regret that we did not get that opportunity.
For the rest, I will submit the substance of our contribution in writing.
But what concerns us is that we think it very important, where this proposal is concerned, that a judicial review should take place.
We are delighted with this proposal from the Committee.
We are pleased that it is based on Article 308 of the Treaty.
This means that there is a role for the Court of Justice and this means that there is a role for the European Parliament.
We are very disappointed in the Council' s rejection yesterday of this legal basis.
The Council has not understood the urgency of this proposal and has also failed to understand the need to base it on Article 308.
By wishing to base it on various articles of the Third Pillar, the Council of course wants to exclude both the Court of Justice and the European Parliament.
It is a serious matter that should most certainly have been discussed in Parliament.
Mrs Buitenweg, I would like to answer you with regard to the way votes are conducted in this House.
I did of course scrupulously apply the Rules of Procedure.
I have to say that I was expecting every group to ask me for this minute of speaking time.
It was not my job to grant it by virtue of an agreement made in the corridors.
In fact, what should have happened and what I was expecting was for a number of Members, 32 to be precise, in order to comply with the Rules of Procedure, to request a debate, which in any case was not possible because we had voted on the topical and urgent debate and at that point the groups asked me for a minute each.
Mr Wurtz was the only one to make this request.
I was the most surprised of all, Mrs Buitenweg.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
To those colleagues who are asking for the floor for an oral explanation of vote on the procedures without report, I remind you that oral explanations of vote cannot be made for procedures without report.
I am sorry, that is the rule.
Does that come from the Rules of Procedure, Madam President?
Yes, it is in Rule 137:
"When a Commission proposal or report is on the agenda of Parliament pursuant to Rules 62, paragraph 5, or 114, Members may submit written explanations of vote pursuant to Rule 1."
International terrorism (C5-0455/2001)
President, I have supported the request for specific measures against terrorism in particular because the right of judicial challenge to the European Court of Justice is enshrined in the legal base.
This has been clarified by the adoption of the amendments put forward by the Green Group in order to protect human rights.
Civil liberties, the infringement of which some are fearful of, should be protected as all procedures are subject to challenge at the European Court of Justice.
We cannot be neutral against terror.
Europe should support the US in finding and suppressing the terrorists but we should also have a long-term plan to deal with conflict resolution and to put in infrastructural support in places like Afghanistan where humanitarian aid is needed but is only a stopgap to a fully functioning society.
For years the European Parliament has called for the support of the civilian population in Afghanistan which has been the subject of terrorism from the Taliban.
Women in particular have suffered.
There have been increasing numbers of attacks on women throughout the region and in Kashmir by Islamic extremists who have thrown acid in their faces injuring them horribly in order to make them wear the burka, a full face covering.
While reaffirming our complete opposition both to terrorist methods and to the reactionary objectives pursued by those responsible for these acts, we refuse to associate ourselves will all of the proposals from the Council of the European Union.
The political leaders of the big imperial powers, both American and European, are trying to channel the legitimate emotions caused by the attacks in New York to serve a policy aimed solely at ensuring their domination over the world, and not at preserving the interests and the safety of the people.
We reject any initiative, even a partial one, aimed towards military operations, which would inevitably make victims of the people, who have nothing to do with terrorism.
Individual terrorism does not justify State terrorism or make it acceptable.
We protest against the measures restricting individual freedoms that this climate of war is bringing about.
As for the fight against the funding of terrorist groups, if the governments really want to conduct it they should immediately abolish banking secrecy and business secrecy.
The prevarications and measures in this area which are as limited as they are ineffective only prove that we prefer to put up with terrorist money and money from organised crime than to ensure total transparency, which could unveil multiple trafficking and ignominies in the capitalist system itself and the considerable wastage that it costs society.
First of all, I must admit that this explanation of vote is difficult.
Like everybody else we are appalled by the attacks that took place on 11 September.
It is frustrating to decide not to use additional means to fight those who committed them.
We are, however, convinced that it is a choice governed by reason, and not by an instinctive reaction, which is legitimate but dangerous, motivated by anger and pain.
Apart from the fact that we refuse to set a precedent on urgent procedures, which could then dramatically increase, we have questions regarding the list proposed in the annex, which reveals genuine and fundamental problems.
Of course, we are in total agreement with the principle of implementing specific measures against people and goods linked to terrorism, in order to fight it more effectively.
There are too many areas of doubt in this well-known list:
How can we support it when we do not even know how it was put together?
On what criteria were these people selected?
We know that there is no definition of terrorism in international law, and that it is therefore impossible to set out objective criteria for what constitutes belonging to a terrorist movement.
All that is needed is to observe how easily some people call any behaviour that goes against prevailing thought 'terrorism' , such as is the case with the anti-globalisation activists or those who are against NGOs, in order to be worried about possible confusions.
Moreover, what about certain general legal principles such as:
Presumption of innocence? Benefit of the doubt?
And who has the burden of proof?
(Speech cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
We wish to once again affirm our complete and unequivocal condemnation of the terrorist acts witnessed in the United States of America, and the need to provide a response based on joint action and international cooperation within the UN that fully respects its Charter.
We must, however, state our strong disagreement with the method that the Commission has sought to impose in presenting its "draft regulation on specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating international terrorism" .
As part of the fight against terrorism, we feel it is necessary to adopt measures for combating organised crime, which specifically involve attacking money-laundering and the various forms of trafficking and abolishing tax havens.
We feel it is unacceptable, however, that a list of organisations and individuals, possibly supplied by the government and intelligence services of the United States - a country which not so long ago opposed any monitoring of tax havens - should be submitted for the approval of the European Parliament, when no supporting evidence has been provided.
Furthermore, it is our view that the necessary fight against terrorism must not be used as a pretext for influencing essential aspects of sovereignty of the Member States of the European Union.
It cannot be repeated often enough that we support the fight against international terrorism and we approve of taking initiatives to freeze funds if it can be shown that they belong to, or come from, individuals or organisations that carry out acts of terrorism.
We recognise the need to react quickly but believe, at the same time, that thorough reflection is important.
The proposal for a regulation is an expression of the fact that the EU is in a position to take action, but not to reflect.
If we are not voting against Parliament' s approval of the initiative, it is for the following reasons.
First of all, we do not believe that Parliament should be consulted on this issue, on which it has no influence.
We think it is completely unacceptable that Parliament should take a view on a regulation proposed by the Commission on the basis of the paper before us, which has been presented in a hurry and which Coreper criticises for lack of cohesion and consistency.
We believe that the procedure whereby Parliament is asked to approve the hasty adoption of the Council proposal is being used by the Council to legitimise a regulation on which thorough work has not been done.
The list attached to the proposal in Annex 1 is of organisations and individuals suspected of being directly or indirectly involved in acts of terrorism.
In our view, the fact that a list prepared in the United States has been approved without hesitation is a matter for criticism.
The proposal contains no guidelines as to how, or in accordance with which criteria, individuals or organisations are to be added to, or crossed off, the list, and it has not been specified which authorities are authorised to draw up the list and according to what principles.
We would criticise the fact that the proposal invalidates fundamental principles of a society governed by law, principles that protect those who have been accused against unfair and unlawful treatment.
It is a fact beneath contempt that the traditional, threefold division of power into legislative, judicial and executive authorities has been invalidated so that the EU can comply with the United States' desire for rapid intervention.
At the same time, it must be emphasised that no infringement of these principles can justify acts of terrorism.
.
(SV) Naturally, I agree without reservation with the total condemnation of terrorism which constitutes the stated motive for this regulation.
However, both the decision process and content of the regulation constitute an insult to that very democracy and rule of law whose protection is claimed to be the aim of the proposal.
The European Parliament has been forced into rushed action without any reports, debate or access to the text of the legislation in many languages, including Swedish.
No positive reason has been given to explain why normal forms of democratic decision-making have to be bypassed.
As it is the Member States which in the final analysis will implement the proposed freezing of suspected terrorists' financial assets and as this must in any case be carried out through measures within each Member State, there is nothing to suggest that an EU regulation is required or that it will speed up the implementation of necessary measures.
At the same time, the regulation is a legal rush job and a mockery of all the grand statements to the effect that the fight against terrorism should not be perceived as a war against Islam or the Arab world.
The regulation contains no definition of terrorism, terrorists or terror organisations whatsoever.
Instead of the legislating body operating in the normal legal way by formulating a general definition of the crime and leaving it to the judicial system to trace, arrest, prosecute and judge those whose actions correspond to the definition of the crime confirmed by law, the legislating body, i.e. the Commission as proposer, the Council as decision-maker and the European Parliament as the body considering the proposal, has pre-empted the application of the law and circumvented the need for a definition of the crime by instead directly announcing 27 'guilty' organisations and people.
The origin of this list cannot be traced to any legal procedure whatsoever, but comes from the CIA.
The list contains a number of names with no more specific information - names which probably belong to several people.
In addition, all the names on the list are easily identifiable as Arabic/Muslim.
The result has been a diversion which is not needed in order for necessary measures to be taken in EU countries against terrorists' financial assets, which breaches fundamental legal principles and which must also be perceived as a one-sided political attack on the Muslim/Arab world.
Through its decision to adopt a number of amendments, the European Parliament has pointed to possible ways of partly, but far from entirely, reducing the deficiencies to which attention has been called.
I believe it would have been more just of the European Parliament in this situation to have shown its dissatisfaction unambiguously by recommending the complete rejection of the Commission' s proposal.
In this way, the Commission would have been able to return with a new proposal which would have genuinely increased the chances of fighting terrorism, would have been based on legal principles and would have ruled out any suspicion that the proposal is one-sidedly directed against the Arabic/Muslim world.
Against this background, I, like a number of my colleagues in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, voted against the proposal in the final vote.
The Commission' s proposal is not only contrary to Article 308 of the Treaty, but it also disregards elementary legal principles and the basic laws of the Member States.
The main reason why I cannot contribute to bringing about this legislation is that the effect of the Commission' s proposal would quite simply be to abolish any form of legal protection.
Even suspected criminals are entitled to fair trials.
It is this fundamental right that the Commission would have us abolish.
The United States has issued the Commission with a list of 27 individuals and organisations.
We have not been given any proof of the activities of these 27, not even the slightest explanation of why precisely these 27 should be judged without evidence and without trial.
What is being required of us is that we undertake to judge these 27 with blindfolds on - definitively and with no recourse to appeal.
We are to wield the rubber stamp here and now and, in classic Dr Strangelove style, shoot first and ask questions afterwards.
Are not democratic principles of law precisely what we wish to defend?
What will be next in line if we give in now and accept that the end justifies the means?
We have voted against this draft regulation because we do not think that appalling terrorist acts such as those on the World Trade Center can be opposed by violating fundamental freedoms.
This draft regulation quite simply asks us to trust the CIA in cutting off the means of subsistence from the 27 groups described, rightly or wrongly, as terrorists by the very agency which, more importantly, is behind some of them.
We did not wait for Mr Bush to denounce tax havens, but under no circumstances will we give his secret services a blank cheque.
The list, put forward with no explanation and which, we are warned, will be extended, no doubt in line with the interests of the USA and its allies, is only an alibi list when compared with the battle as a whole, against both tax havens and the perpetrators of death who profit from them.
As we definitely do not have the same definition of terrorism as Mr Bush, and as the list of the guilty remains open, we propose that the company TotalFinaElf should be added to it as the 28th organisation, as it is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths around the world and is directly linked to terrorist activities, particularly in Africa.
The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the European Parliament' s amendment to the Council proposal for a regulation on specific arrangements placing restrictions upon certain persons and groups with a view to combating international terrorism.
We agree that the EU must combat international terrorism in all areas.
Nonetheless, we have general reservations about the proposal and, for example, reject the list of 27 terrorist organisations.
These organisations all appear to be Muslim, which may be construed as discrimination when there are also non-Muslim terrorist organisations.
These organisations ought, in the nature of the matter, to be included in the list, which cannot therefore be regarded as complete.
Moreover, we have reservations as to whether such a list can in practice be used at all.
I abstained on the final vote because although I agree with the principle behind this regulation, I cannot agree to the inclusion of Annex 1.
This regulation speaks about International Terrorism generally and does not specifically refer to the events of September 11.
Therefore it seems totally wrong for this Annex to be included which only refers to individuals and organisations who appear to be solely from the Islamic Community.
I am also concerned that the evidence against the people and organisations listed in the Annex has not been seen by European Parliamentarians and therefore we have not been able to decide for ourselves whether those listed are guilty of terrorism or not.
The European Parliament has been asked to act urgently and decisively to freeze funds that could be used for terrorists.
We have risen to this challenge, and in doing so have made essential amendments to protect liberties of innocent people.
I am personally proud of the amendment that demands action to give details that make persons named in the annex actually identifiable.
It would be absurd to go forward with a list of names that could refer ambiguously to thousands of people in the Islamic world, rolling innocent people in with sinister ones.
The Council of Ministers has called for speed and decisiveness.
We have responded and underlined the need for judicial safeguards fully compatible with decisive and immediate action.
We are effectively challenging the Council to keep faith with us and not delay matters by devising a new version without judicial safeguards.
We voted against this draft regulation for a number of reasons.
We strongly believe that granting such powers without proper debate and without a parliamentary report on the matter is legally questionable.
The fact that the protection of civil liberties is not addressed in the regulation is appalling, and the invoking of Article 308 sets a dangerous precedent for rushing through emergency legislation without any open and transparent debate.
It is also questionable whether the European Commission had the right to invoke this article in such circumstances and it could be in breach of some national constitutions.
The European Parliament was asked to vote on a list of 27 organisations without any explanation as to the basis under which they were chosen, who or what they are, and without any mention of safeguards if one of these organisations or persons was wrongfully accused.
We do not believe that the European Parliament has the right to act as judge and jury on such matters and most especially when the facts are not clearly explained in a transparent and open manner.
We of course welcome any new measures to combat terrorism; however, such measures must be properly thought out and properly debated in a transparent and democratic manner, not, as happened this week, in a atmosphere of panic.
Any new measures must enshrine human rights, protect civil liberties and recognise the assumption of innocence, if they are to be truly effective.
. (NL) It is an old custom to isolate political opponents by labelling them terrorists.
When ex-terrorists became the leaders of South Africa, Israel, the Palestinian Authority and a very large number of former colonies, they suddenly became reasonable and respectable people in the eyes of many, and their former opponents were blamed - rightly so - for causing the violence.
By nipping in the bud every prospect of peaceful means towards a better life, they had driven the opposition to desperation.
That is why we must always draw a sharp distinction between opposition, in particular, campaigns resulting in socio-economic and administration changes, and irrational violence, which is only aimed at bringing about fear and destruction.
The American list of 27 suspected organisations with an Islamic background raises in some cases the suspicion that the support of governments in the battle against international terrorism is being bought by labelling their internal opponents terrorists as well.
We are, then, committing the same error as in making abortion, euthanasia and trading in soft drugs by inhabitants of Member States indictable offences where these are permitted by the legal administrations of other Member States.
In the justified battle against real terrorism, not everything now being proposed is fair and appropriate - not by a long chalk.
I do not agree with this ill-considered approach.
I believe that it is sensible to freeze the bank accounts of organisations or individuals who perpetrate or support acts of terrorism such as those which took place on 11 September 2001.
What has been submitted here, however, is a list of individuals and organisations who are merely assumed to have been involved in some way in the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.
However, it is possible to proceed against them, even without a judicial process or final proof.
Such a measure would be comparable with being remanded in custody, when suspects have not yet been found guilty in a court of law.
If no evidence of guilt is found, prisoners on remand are released and paid compensation.
No such provision is envisaged here.
Moreover, the clause contained in Article 2(2) enables other unpopular persons and organisations to be included on this legally dubious list.
Given that the Justice and Home Affairs Council has already talked about urban violence in connection with terrorism, I fear that this will make it possible to freeze the bank accounts of individuals or organisations who demonstrate against the EU's policies at European Councils, for example.
Had I voted in favour of this resolution, I would have given my support to a questionable and arbitrary act.
I therefore voted against the resolution despite my sharp condemnation of terrorism.
The members of the MPF group in this House have voted in favour of the Council regulation that makes provision for, following the Extraordinary European Council meeting in Brussels on 21 September, a number of measures to fight terrorism.
It is not the case that we think these measures in themselves constitute a total, satisfactory and coherent response to the formidable threat we face.
We simply think that it is a first step in the right direction and that we now need to tackle, without delay or taboos, the task of generally reviewing our legislation so that the intention expressed by the Presidency of the Council to conduct a policy against terrorism that is both 'global' and 'sustainable' does not remain some kind of mantra, but is something that can be translated into reality.
In this respect, some of the proposals made here yesterday by Minister Michel concern us, because they reflect the persistence among some of our leaders, despite the events of 11 September, of the same 'old way of thinking' , to use Mr Gorbachev' s expression, of the same ideological vein which for years has inspired, at European level, lax and demagogical measures with regard to the movement of people, which have led to us giving up control of our territory and have made the European Union an epicentre for Islamic terrorism.
When Mr Michel asserts that the wide-ranging legislative review advocated by our fellow member Mr Berthu that aims to make the safety of our people a priority 'leads straight towards a liberticidal society' , he is adding to this confusion that is the root of all of our shortcomings.
Is it not as a result of seeing every removal of controls as a step towards freedom that we have paved the way for terrorists such as those who went on to attack the United States?
The fact that any serious measure of control, particularly if it is a national measure, is still seen as a liberticidal proposal, says a great deal about how far there is to go before the old libertarian ideology is abandoned and before the debate can rise to the challenges we are having to face as a result of current events.
(Speech cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure).
Extraordinary European Council (RC B5-0666/2001)
Calling an Extraordinary European Council meeting was undoubtedly the right move following the terrorist attack in the United States.
Naturally the European Union is being cautious in its response, so far at least, but there a number of sensitive points which merit special attention:
a) the reference to Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, without specifying the country from which the attack has emanated, creates a particularly dangerous climate of war and reckoning;
b) police measures to combat terrorism must be limited by respect for citizens' freedoms;
c) a policy needs to be defined towards "friendly" countries such as Saudi Arabia, which have helped by funding the spread of fundamentalism;
d) resolving the Palestinian question, especially the problem of Jerusalem, will release huge numbers of Muslims from under the spell and control of Islam;
e) fundamental intervention in the global problem of poverty will free whole societies in Asia and Africa from the despair which feeds terrorism;
f) the European Union must avoid Mr Berlusconi's divisiveness and Mr Blair's sermonising and take a calm and friendly approach towards Islam.
We wish, once again, to state our total condemnation of the terrorist acts witnessed in the United States and, once again, pay respect to the suffering and the struggle of the victims' families and of the American people and call for the fight against terrorism not to contribute to creating more victims.
The fight against international terrorism will only be totally effective if it is carried out under the auspices of the United Nations and this is why we specifically reject the use of Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, which runs the risk of dragging the European Union and the international community into a spiral of violence with incalculable consequences.
It is also our view that the fight against terrorism, which is, of course, necessary, must not be used as a pretext to undermine individuals' fundamental rights, freedoms and protection under the law, or affect essential aspects of the sovereignty of the European Union' s Member States, including militarisation.
What we do feel is important is that, in parallel with the fight against international terrorism, we pursue the fight against money laundering, including the abolition of tax havens.
Our vote, therefore, reflects our profound disagreement with some of the joint resolution' s main aspects, voted for by a majority in plenary, although we support most of the remaining points.
I voted against the resolution for several reasons.
I believe that bringing to justice those responsible for the terrorist attacks in the United States should not mean suffering and terror for other innocent people.
It is vital that any action taken in response to these atrocities does not trigger more attacks like it or even worse.
The international community has a duty to seek to understand what may have led to these terrible crimes.
It must try to understand because to refuse to do so will contribute to the likelihood that much worse lies ahead.
I believe that the United States, and the coalition of countries that has been formed, must be sensitive to global security as a whole.
If the US responds with attacks on Afghanistan it too will be killing innocent people and two wrongs never make a right.
I strongly feel that we, as politicians in the democratic world, have a great responsibility to uphold the principles of non-violence and to ensure that such unjustifiable violence does not escalate.
. (NL) The fact that people should kill themselves and many others in the terrible manner of 11 September in New York and Washington is a sign of hate and desperation.
You can only combat terrorism by helping to remove the breeding ground for violence, not by causing yet more outrage.
The way in which Israel seeks out and liquidates violent Palestinian opponents only appears to evoke more sympathy for violent resistance.
There is now the threat of that very mistake being repeated on a global scale.
When it comes to matters of climate, armament and racism, the US President sought isolation.
The formation of a coalition of the rich and powerful, led by him, against the poor and rebellious will be counter-productive in the long run.
I side with the only American politician who had the courage to vote against the warmongering, following in the footsteps of those few German socialist dissenters at the beginning of the First World War.
The money we are about to waste on war would be better spent on prevention.
Within Europe, this would involve making ourselves as secure as possible against attacks, something which would be possible if we did not privatise airport security and air traffic safety and if we paid closer attention to safety standards for very tall buildings.
Outside of Europe, it would involve helping to solve the problems of poverty, neglect and injustice.
British Conservatives strongly support measures which are specifically designed to combat terrorism in all its forms.
In this spirit therefore, we have supported the motion for a resolution and the counter-terrorist legislative measures being adopted by Council.
However, we do not support the proposition that 'combating international terrorism implies a distinct strengthening of the relevant EU competencies', or that the EU should have responsibility for negotiating agreements on judicial and police cooperation with the US, which are properly a national responsibility, given the very different constitutional, judicial and operational traditions of key Member States such as the United Kingdom.
We see no connection between the need for a resolute response to the recent terrorist attacks and the call for intensification of efforts to operationalise the European Security and Defence Policy.
On the contrary, recent events underline the need for stronger transatlantic ties, and an enhancement of NATO, rather than the potentially divisive pursuit of some autonomous EU military capability.
In addition, we wish to ensure that any new counter-terrorist legislation is also used to bear down on those terrorist organisations, such as the IRA in all its forms, and ETA, that have been conducting terrorist campaigns from and within EU Member States over the past several decades.
Stability and Growth Pact (RC B5-0602/2001)
The collapse of liberal dogmas is becoming increasingly apparent.
The 'stability pact' and the anti-democratic powers that the European Central Bank has been given operate in an extremely restrictive fashion, at a time when radical change in the direction of European integration is becoming particularly pressing.
The demonstrations by trades unions and other organisations that arose as a result of the meeting of the Ecofin Council in Liège and debates at the European Citizens' Congress have highlighted the urgency of the social and democratic demands made by movements that are opposed to the prospect of globalisation in line with the current capitalist globalisation.
The Ecofin Council, however, once again demonstrated its inability to communicate.
It did not make any proposal in proportion to what is at stake.
Its debates continue to be characterised by a total lack of transparency and responsibility, as illustrated by the fate of the Tobin tax.
Ministers went back on their public commitments in referring the matter to the Commission, which we know is hostile to such a decision, no matter how elementary it may seem.
In the same vein, the burning question of tax havens was only voluntarily broached from the specific angle of the fight against terrorism.
The governments of the Union are not yet ready to change direction.
This is the fundamental issue hidden behind the joint resolutions put forward for the vote. And this is the reason why we will vote against them.
Japan is now experiencing a recession.
The United States are not far behind, Europe is seeing considerably less growth and a recession is not completely out of the question.
In order to prevent a global recession, it makes perfect sense to boost economic activity by means of coordinated action with Japan and the United States, through increasing public expenditure up to a limit of 3% of the public deficit of each EU Member State, on the condition that:
the purpose of increasing expenditure is to improve public investment and to encourage private investment; and
at the same time, efforts are redoubled to implement structural reforms that stimulate employment, investment and competitiveness.
The Stability and Growth Programme must, therefore, be made more flexible, in addition to the flexibility resulting from 'automatic stabilisation' , and this is why I abstained on the motion for a resolution tabled by the PPE-DE Group.
Hieronymi Report (A5-0286/2001)
The adoption of the "Television without Frontiers" directive was a milestone in Community legislation.
Yet, here we are, over ten years on, and the editorial changes needed to protect viewers and European cultural productions have still not been made.
Below are the three most important points:
a) viewers need to be protected from the flood of advertisements by strengthening the binding arrangements in the directive and controlling and punishing televisions stations which infringe them;
b) minors need general protection at Community level from advertising and from programmes which desensitise them to violence and anti-social behaviour; and
c) stricter, specific measures are needed to promote European productions and make it easier for producers in small countries to break into the wider European market.
, Färm, Hedkvist Petersen, Hulthén, Hans Karlsson, Theorin (PSE), in writing.
(SV) We Swedish Social Democrats believe that it is vital that minors be protected from television advertising aimed at children , as this group is particularly susceptible and may have difficulty differentiating advertising from other programming.
In Sweden, TV advertising aimed at children under 12 is totally forbidden under the Swedish Radio and Television Act.
According to Directive 97/36/EC, advertising must be clearly identifiable as such.
Children under a certain age cannot appreciate the difference between advertising aimed at children and normal children' s programmes.
Slightly older children can appreciate the differences but not understand the purpose of the advertising.
(Research report by Gunilla Jarlbro of Gothenburg University).
We therefore believe that this must not be promoted, which is why we are voting against this part (paragraph 1 aa) of the report.

First and foremost, I must thank both our rapporteur in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, Mrs Hieronymi and the whole of the Committee for the high-quality work they put before us and their interesting reaction to the third report from the Commission to the Council, the EP and the ESC on the application of Directive 89/522/EEC "Television without frontiers" , whose main objective is to put a legal framework in place to promote the free movement of audiovisual broadcasting services within the single market and to guarantee certain general interests such as the promotion of cultural diversity and the protection of consumers and of minors.
Many reasons can be given to justify my vote in favour of this report; I shall simply mention them.
Taking into account that 98% of homes have a television, the report firstly and quite rightly points out that the social impact of television is becoming increasingly significant, especially for children.
Meanwhile, regarding the protection of minors, the report asks the Member States to step up their dialogue, to define common solutions without threatening their independence in terms of national restrictions for the protection of minors.
This can be put in another way by saying that the audiovisual sector plays an essential role in democracy and informing the people, and is therefore emerging as a reflection of the level of freedom of expression and plurality of ideas that can be expressed and understood.
Moreover, the report also highlights the extent to which the audiovisual sector is a leading sector both in the economy and for employment in the European Union: in 1997, the audiovisual sector employed more than a million people in Europe and its revenue should increase by 70% between now and 2005.

Berès Report (A5-0307/2001)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on 1 January 2002, economic and monetary union will be completed.
For each Member State, there will be a continued and binding obligation and need to consolidate public budgets on a sustained basis.
This is set out not only in the Commission report but also by the rapporteur herself.
I fully support this objective.
I therefore welcome the report's proposal that the current requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact be expanded with new and individual objectives for each country.
Consolidating the public budget is the main priority for every government in order to create the required scope for action.
As a representative of Austria, I know what I am talking about.
Despite all the difficulties and a mountain of debt, the new government is working to ensure that the ambitious goal of achieving a zero deficit remains in place.
Färm, Hedkvist Petersen, Hans Karlsson (PSE), in writing.
(SV) We Swedish Social Democrats have abstained from voting in the vote on paragraph 2 and recital B.
Paragraph 2:
It is good that the Eurogroup is developing its cooperation on monetary issues. However, to transfer all cooperation on economic policy to the Eurogroup would be wrong.
We do not, therefore, support a possible amendment to the Treaty in order to strengthen the Eurogroup' s powers in the economic area, in any case not until we have more concrete proposals.
Against the background of EU enlargement, it is particularly important that Member States outside the Eurogroup have the opportunity to take part in economic cooperation.
Recital B:
We do not wish to give our support to progressively binding legislation in the economic area, at least not until we know more about the specific implications.
The report makes the indisputable observation that "Economic Europe is not yet a reality".
The reasons for this are no mystery.
Each national State is, more than anything else, concerned with protecting the interests of its own capitalist class and favours national policy most suited to that objective.
The ruling classes have no need, however, for the European institutions to harmonise their policies, apart from settling national rivalries, in order to improve the profitability of their capital to the detriment of the working classes.
In terms of freezing salaries, widespread lack of job security, mass redundancies, savings on public services and attacks against social protection, capitalist Europe has no need for institutional harmonisation in order to be united.
The Bérès report considers that "sound public finance" is the prime condition for "strengthening economic policy coordination within the euro area".
However, it does not say how that financial balance should be reached.
Who should pay?
Capitalist companies or consumers through VAT?
Who should benefit more from budgetary spending?
Public services or private employers?
Without tax gifts to capitalist companies, budgets could be used more for public services without being in deficit as a result.
This is clearly not the line taken in the report.
Under these circumstances there was no question of us supporting it with our vote.
The Berès report is interesting because it acknowledges the failure of a social liberalism that thought it could combine acceptance of the Treaty of Amsterdam with genuine social policies in Europe.
The report advocates the coordination of economic policies, but realises that the institutions that could perform this do not exist.
The ECB is obsessed with one single issue, Parliament is powerless, and the Eurogroup is semi-clandestine.
The report simply begs it to please keep Parliament informed.
The report does however contain a large amount of truth, as throughout there is concern about the institutional void and regressive policies that risk being implemented under the influence of neo-liberal dogma.
But instead of saying out loud what is being discussed increasingly widely, that it would be reasonable not to apply the Stability Pact, the report is content to advocate coordination of 'their respective stability programmes' .
This quite pitiful desire to limit damage cannot make us forget that the shackles were put in place with the active support of liberal socialists, particularly in Italy and France.
This is why we did not lend our support to vague and ill-conceived orders that, more than anything, serve to make us forget that we have in fact made a huge mistake.
. (EL) A single currency requires a single economic policy.
This, basically, is the conclusion drawn by both the Commission report and the rapporteur's report.
Member States are being further restricted in the exercise of economic policy to a framework of decisions taken in advance and national parliaments are required to do no more than observe or, even worse, execute decisions taken by the ÅU.
This is an attempt to undermine the workers' facility to react, as they are doing more and more decisively, to the choices made by big business.
The EC report welcomes the EU's anti-grass roots policy and includes proposals whose sole function is as an alibi for the rampantly neo-liberal economic and social policy of the ÅU and the tragic impact which it has on the lower classes, such as prior agreement on the allocation of fortuitous or exceptional tax revenue - just to make sure nothing is spent on the social security sector.
Integrating the "issue of the ageing population" into national budgets is another move in the same direction.
While the report posits that unemployment still affects 14 million Europeans and that the economic and social situation has not improved, it remains faithful to the policy of structural change and unemployment sharing.
The involvement of the national parliaments in the form of an annual evaluation of the application of the broad economic policy guidelines decided in the European Council and the debate on the stability programmes approved by the Commission and the Council, are no more than a semblance of democracy, the aim of which is to entrap national representations in Community procedures, especially when it is proposed to strengthen the role of the Commission and impose sanctions on Member States which fail to apply the economic policy imposed by Brussels.
It is an attempt to make national institutions accessories to a process which, on the pretext of coordinating economic policies within the broad economic policy guidelines, is further subjugating wage measures and social policy measures in general to the suffocatingly restrictive criteria for cohesion and of the Stability Pact.
The Member States are expressly called on to "coordinate their actions and refrain from adopting tax, budgetary or wage policies".
The break-up of the guaranteed national insurance system, in conjunction with wage cuts and the fact that working hours and costs are arranged to suit employers, are demonstrably increasing poverty and social exclusion among the working classes and reducing the quality and extent of services offered.
Obviously, the more measures passed to restrict income and workers' rights, the greater the pressure for more structural measures, and the more the signs of slump in the economy increase, the stricter austerity policy becomes.
Peijs report (A5-0306/2001)
I voted in favour of the excellent report presented to us by Mrs Peijs for the following reasons.
As we all know, the last 30 years have seen an excessive increase in public spending in Europe, which has forced Member States to raise taxes to an unsustainable level.
It is, therefore, crucial that we reduce the tax burden, by implementing the reforms necessary to achieve this, so as to improve incentives for employment and for business activity.
The attempt that is being made to define a sustainable method of tax relief is, therefore, to be applauded.
I hope that the Commission will continue in its efforts to guide national governments' approach to tax relief, specifically by establishing a 'code of conduct' .
With regard to the issue of trying to ensure that the largest possible proportion of the active population has access to the labour market, it is essential that we abolish the social, fiscal and administrative obstacles preventing women and older people from returning to work and/or from remaining in work.
This is particularly important because features of demographic change have been - as the United Nations' report for 2000 quite rightly points out - a slowdown in the growth of the population of active age and the increase in the population over 65 years old, which raises the enormous concern of maintaining the social security system or even of trying to prevent potential economic hardship arising as a result of having an insufficiently large workforce for our labour markets.
It is equally important that we give priority to the access of young people to the labour market as well as to lifelong learning, which will require an increase in public and private spending in the fields of education, research and development, along with, of course, the respective structural reforms, so that the effective transition to a knowledge-based society can go ahead.
This report demonstrates little concern for the social and economic situation of certain Member States and dwells on the need to pursue budgetary consolidation and compliance with the Stability Pact.
This is a very short-sighted position, which is why we propose it be removed.
What is really required is the immediate suspension of the Stability Pact and a thorough review of its objectives, criteria and bases.
We also disagree with the idea that public investment is not a solution to the crisis or that it is generally poorly managed and led, which is why we have tabled a proposal for an amendment that highlights the importance of public investment for economic growth and employment.
A degree of commitment to solving social problems, job creation and combating social exclusion and poverty require no longer attaching priority to maintaining monetary stability at all costs, when we know that the consequences of this will be further unemployment, wage caps and more poverty.
Deplorably, the various amendments we tabled on a thorough rewording of the report have not been adopted.
The Peijs report is a true neo-liberal anthem that portrays public finances and social protection as the root of all evil.
For example, the report contrasts inevitably "ill-managed" public investment with the private sector, which is, naturally, efficient.
Its main function is to once again affirm the neo-liberal dogma codified in the "Stability Pact" signed in Amsterdam in 1997, and to condemn the adjustments suggested at the Gothenburg summit on automatic stabilisers.
Now that the economic climate is changing due to a persistent wage moderation policy, the report affirms the right to inflict a fresh recession on Europe.
It advocates blindly applying a policy that everyone will notice goes against the announced objectives for growth and employment.
When the economy slows down, the Stability Pact contributes to the chaos by slowing business down, because in reality it aims to achieve an unemployment level that will bring salaries back down and increase profits.
We must vote against this report, as applying it would pose a genuine danger to the workers of Europe.
. (NL) Fluctuations, with their peaks and troughs, are characteristic of a market economy.
At times of economic stagnation of growth or when consumption levels fall, there is no sense in talking people into unrealistic optimism.
This would be a form of deceit and would lead to recklessness in consumption and risk-bearing investment.
It would be better to expand existing governmental provisions or to introduce new ones.
This was the method successfully used in America under Roosevelt during the `30s crisis, and with which western Europe was successfully rebuilt after 1945.
For that matter, it was also the method by which authoritarian states such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were able to build economies which were much stronger than outsiders had predicted.
In all those cases, whether we agreed with them or not, the result was an unexpected number of satisfied people.
Instead of learning from that, we now see a reversion to the primitive standpoints of the 19th and early 20th centuries preceding these successes.
Tax reductions, in favour of high incomes and big business, are now considered to be positive, while government spending is considered to be very negative.
The report by Mrs Peijs fits in with this now predominant trend.
As I expect poverty and instability as a result, I am not in favour.
Longo report (A5-0299/2001)
Prominent in this report is a whole set of demands for speeding up the process of liberalisation in various sectors.
It even criticises the Stockholm European Council for not having fixed a timetable for the definitive liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets, which is unacceptable.
We also reject its call for Member States to move ahead rapidly and in a uniform way on opening up the energy, transport and postal services markets.
It therefore comes as no surprise that it attacks the public monopolies, specifically in the field of electricity, that it calls for the local call market to be opened up or that it considers that the privatisation and liberalisation of public services will lead to lower prices and higher quality.
.
(EL) The real world today is a world in which huge monopolies abuse dominant market position, where gigantic companies merge, consolidate or are taken over on a daily basis and where monopoly groups acquire terrifying power, invariably accompanied by thousands of redundancies, which have a huge impact on employment, and the monopolisation of wealth-creating resources, markets and consumers.
There were 345 new mergers in 2000, to quote the report, thanks to increasingly flexible legislation which fosters the creation of large monopolies which acquire dominant market positions.
However, this is of no concern to the ÅU.
What does concern it is setting a timetable for the definitive liberalisation of the natural gas and electricity markets, speeding up the rate at which the energy, transport and postal services markets are liberalised and safeguarding universal access to services of general interest, in order to improve the competitiveness of the economy.
It is also concerned with abolishing state aid.
However, the desperate attempt to abolish state aid is really an attempt to increase the profits of the already strong players and to consolidate their market position by excluding new competitors and applying the law of the jungle, the law of might is right and the supremacy of monopoly interests.
State intervention does not, of course, touch the heart of the capitalist system and it often strengthens companies and businesses on a selective basis.
However, without state intervention, even with the tiny, balancing role which it can play, the gulf will widen constantly to the detriment of less developed areas and sectors and the poorest sections of society, given that structural measures and denationalisation are carried out not for their benefit but to strengthen the profitability of big business.
That is why the constant pressure for measures such as the proposed register of state aid and the subsidy scoreboard is intolerable.
All the choices made by big business illustrate how worried it is about the possible renationalisation of competition policy (i.e. control by the Member States, not the Commission of the European Union), which is why the report proposes an international competition system in the framework of the WTO.
The competition policy applied has resulted in large branches of European industry dismissing workers and losing important shares of the global market and hundreds of thousands of jobs.
The disgraceful concentration of power, in strategically important sectors, has put the economy of entire countries in the hands of speculative multinational groups, with everything that implies for the workers.
The loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs has caused unemployment to spiral.
The workers are facing the biggest attack yet on their employment and social rights, they are watching their standard of living being eroded, poverty spread and the public sector and productive base in most countries in the Union being restructured and dissolved in the name of rampant and catastrophic competition, in the name of an absolute market economy and in order to promote the monopoly aspirations of big business.
That is why protests against globalisation and the prevalence of the uncontrolled rules of the market economy are growing day by day.
We consider that the competition policy applied is responsible for all this and we intend to express our complete opposition to it by voting against the report.
Huhne report (A5-0301/2001)
In spring last year, together with the Council, we adopted the Electronic Commerce Directive which is due to come into force on 17 January 2002.
The pillar of this Directive is the country of origin approach.
When the report before us was discussed in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the first time, I was surprised to find that some members of the relevant Committee wanted to call this country of origin approach into question again for online financial services.
Yet this is quite absurd.
If the European Parliament and the Lisbon European Council have set a deadline of 2005 for establishing an integrated market in financial services, we cannot afford to adopt incoherent legislation or keep re-examining decisions which have already been taken, unless we have very good reason to do so.
This applies not only to some Members of this House but also to the Council, whose vote last Thursday on the Directive on Distance Marketing of Financial Services I greatly regret.
We opted for the country of origin approach - so we should now apply it in a targeted and coherent fashion.
I would also like to join the rapporteur in congratulating the Commission on its initiative in establishing the European Extrajudicial Network (EEJ-NET) and the Financial Services Complaints Network (FIN-NET).
Simple, cost-effective, non-judicial procedures for cross-border redress can only enhance consumer confidence in the development of cross-border financial services.
Naturally, consumers must be made aware of the existence of these networks, and I therefore also support the proposal that all websites providing online financial services should advertise these networks.
Berger report (A5-0310/2001)
The services sector is of fundamental importance to the future development of the European Union' s economy and already accounts for the largest share of its GDP and more than two-thirds of employment.
It therefore deserves our full attention to ensuring improvements in its quality and to maintaining employment.
The main concerns of the Commission, however, as stated in its communication, focus on establishing an internal market for services, studying the obstacles to the free movement of services across national borders, proposing their removal, and working towards speeding up the liberalisation of postal services, the distance selling of financial services, acquisition proposals and value added tax on digital products.
The rapporteur, as well as agreeing with the Commission proposal, highlights the need to speed up and complete the process of liberalisation in sectors such as postal services, electricity and energy, which we are bound to reject, since, in general, this is designed to demote the State to a role of merely regulating the activities of public services, establishing supposedly independent regulatory bodies, which are directly or indirectly controlled by economic and financial groups.
By and large, the results of liberalisation are redundancies, increased prices for public service provision, a reduction in the quantity and quality of service provision and the rejection of the right of universal access to public services.
Khanbai report (A5-0263/2001)
The Khanbhai report makes an extraordinary analysis of one of the most serious challenges facing the world today; the fight against the main communicable diseases in the context of poverty reduction.
Communicable diseases kill around 10 000 people every day in Africa, with 35 million people throughout the world contaminated with Aids.
HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis are, therefore, a terrible threat to the social and economic development of the poorest communities, and as Mr Khanbhai argues, require a rapid, effective and wide-ranging response, in which the EU must take the lead.
These diseases cause not only human suffering and an extremely high number of deaths, which are in themselves justification enough for such a response, but also cause a drastic reduction in life expectancy and in the labour force, with all the social and economic consequences that this entails They seriously disable large working populations, retard social and economic development and destabilise communities that are already weakened.
I therefore agree with the rapporteur when he states the urgent need to create an Infectious Disease Fund, which is crucial to providing medical treatment for those affected, to identifying carriers, to prevention and research and to the development of new medicines and vaccines.
. (NL) In questions to the European Commission, I have already on a number of occasions strongly recommended measures to ensure that medicines to combat prevalent fatal diseases are available to inhabitants of the Third World.
Remedies against tropical diseases are often available to foreign tourists from rich countries, but not to the large majority of the local population.
Existing medicines, which have worked effectively for many years, are even being withdrawn from the market.
The reason for this is the lack of spending power in those countries to buy these medicines.
If we see medicines as mere commodities, protected by patent rights which ensure that the cost of earlier development expenditure is forever passed on, there will be no medicines available to poor countries and certainly not to their poorest inhabitants.
Such medicines often cost more than the annual income of people living there.
The proposals by Mr Khanbhai for international recognition by the EU of the right of developing countries to produce generic treatments for epidemic diseases without having to pay the costs of intellectual property rights, as well as the stimulation of production of treatments for diseases caused by poverty and the periodical review of the TRIPs agreement are essential to reach a solution.
The report makes a number of good points.
However, they pale before the sheer extent of the misery and shame suffered by millions of people throughout the world, especially in undeveloped countries, where they are still living in poverty, deprived of even basic access to health, and dying from infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS and so on.
It is even more of a disgrace when there is the certain prospect - based on official studies and research - that the situation will get worse.
The acceptance that health is a "global public good", as the report rightly points out, cannot be reconciled with the fact that a large proportion of the world's population is deprived of access to education, housing, employment, food, safe drinking water, conditions of hygiene and health services.
More than 5 million people a year die from infectious diseases, mainly in underdeveloped countries, while a handful of multinational pharmaceutical monopolies continue to patent, profit from and speculate with drugs, even going so far as to withdraw drugs which, although they save lives, fall short of profit targets.
It is not right to channel any additional resources for developing research to the private sector in the form of incentives rather than to public research centres.
It is insulting and hypocritical to state that the "global public good" of health is being hit particularly hard in underdeveloped countries, while at the same time imposing structural changes on these countries by reducing expenditure on the public service sector, especially the health and education sectors.
It is unacceptable to rely on the "charity" of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for action to safeguard this "global good" and to trust in "better cooperation" and "partnership" between the public sector, NGOs and the private sector.
Health is a fundamental and inalienable human right, it is the most important factor of social justice and human dignity and it cannot be ruled by market regulations and the laws of profit.
It is of prime and capital importance to use public-sector means to fight disease and secure the right to health.
However, a radical approach to the problem involves hitting at the root of poverty, at what sustains and exacerbates it.
The report hardly even touches on this sort of solution to the problem, making do with regurgitating constantly repeated "analgesic" announcements and proposals.
Overturning the social policy system and policies which apply the established imperialist and monopoly interests which generate and spread poverty and misery, which have no hesitation in crushing and sacrificing entire populations and nations to their cause, is the only solution to the problem.
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
Support for a framework agreement in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
The first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0617/2001 by Mr Haarder, on behalf of the ELDR Group;
B5-0626/2001 by Mrs Pack and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;
B5-0634/2001 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group;
B5-0643/2001 by Mr Swoboda and Mr Wiersma, on behalf of the PSE Group;
B5-0653/2001 by Mrs Morgantini, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;
B5-0660/2001 by Mr Lagendijk and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group,
on support for a framework agreement in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Mr President, I think that two messages must be sent to Macedonia today.
The first should be to the government of Macedonia. Much gratitude should be conveyed, as well as admiration expressed, for the courage demonstrated by the Macedonian government in proposing amendments to the constitution and giving the Albanian minority the place required by a modern democracy.
It has been difficult, and the European Union must express its heartfelt gratitude to the Macedonian government for what it has done.
The second message I think we should convey to Macedonia should be addressed to the NLA, or what is known as the liberation movement.
It will be appreciated that this originally emerged under Milosevic - I shall not go through the whole story - but now there is only one thing to say to the NLA and to its remnants in northern Macedonia, and that is: the struggle is over now; all weapons must be handed in now; there is now no reason at all for the NLA to continue with the activities of which it has been guilty - and I use the word 'guilty' advisedly, for the NLA is of course a very mixed organisation, certain aspects of which do not bear too close examination.
Now, the Albanian population has been accorded its full civic rights. That is the way to solve problems involving minorities.
I myself come from a border area between Denmark and Germany, in which we solved all the problems 45 years ago by according both minorities, north and south of the border, full rights in a modern democracy.
That is what Macedonia has now also chosen to do.
It is the right way, and both parties deserve our thanks.
Mr President, although our views on the NLA might differ slightly, I endorse Mr Haarder's comments that the task now is to preserve peace.
Peace is still a precarious commodity in Macedonia, perhaps because faith in a shared solution, a shared state and a shared society is not yet fully established.
This is not surprising, for something like this takes longer than sitting at a negotiating table and engaging in negotiations.
However, if we look at the Framework Agreement, I think it is very important that renouncing violence is the first priority.
This is a democracy; it does not need violence to bring about change.
In a democracy, it must be possible to talk about change, conduct negotiations and then bring forth legislation to achieve change.
The second point is the country's integrity.
We do not need new borders or new states painstakingly drawn along some sort of ethnic lines, but which can never be drawn precisely.
We only need to look at the capital Skopje to see how impossible this is.
I have never understood why both sides - even if only briefly - have actually talked about the option of dividing the country.
Thirdly, this is a multiethnic state.
Many countries are multicultural, but this is a multiethnic state with a significant Albanian minority which cannot treated in the same way as a five or six percent minority.
Its status must be enhanced.
Its status has been enhanced, and we think it is right that these minority rights are being expanded beyond the usual extent.
I believe that overall, a good compromise has been found.
We will be in Skopje in the next few days.
We will stress the need for the remaining necessary measures to be put in place.
For our point of view, this continual prevarication and threat that there will be no agreement and coordination after all, or that there may be recourse to violence once more, are incomprehensible and unacceptable.
I hope that just as we are able to discuss Macedonia with a greater sense of satisfaction today, this prevarication will give way to a genuine feeling of satisfaction and acceptance within the next month or so.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the weapons have been collected, so it is claimed.
The NLA has been dissolved, so it claims.
We all know that there are still a great many weapons in Macedonia, and the issue of a criminal association is still on the agenda.
It includes those who want it.
I still assume that most Albanians want it.
I also assume that most Macedonians want it.
However, the problem in many Slav Macedonian heads has not yet been resolved - otherwise, we would never have had the problem in the first place.
In recent years, nothing was done to enable the Albanian minority - a substantial 28 percent of the population - to participate genuinely as citizens on an equal footing.
If this issue had been addressed seven or eight years ago, instead of just two years ago, and if progressive measures had been taken to make all citizens equal, the rebels would not have had such an easy ride, in my view.
It is a pity - also for the Macedonian people - that it now looks as if there is only a response when criminal elements appear to be overrunning the country.
It is a pity, but it is the fault of all the political parties on the ground.
Ultimately, we have now achieved what this House has always asked for.
As Mr Swoboda has said, I would also like to remind you that we do not want a divided country.
Macedonia is a state.
It should continue to be a state, and it should not be divided along ethnic or national lines.
Anyone who considers this option puts the entire region at risk.
That is something which is extremely dangerous.
I very much hope that this new Parliament will also now try to implement the laws as quickly as possible.
The problem is that we are now hearing that what they have already voted for is being called into question again, and that sessions of parliament are constantly being postponed.
Obviously, there are reasons for this.
In Tetovo, for example, repeated attacks are being carried out on the Macedonian police.
We must ask ourselves why this is happening.
We must therefore be very diplomatic but firm with all our colleagues in Macedonia and ask them to make genuine efforts to progress with the Ohrid Agreement.
We must not allow any recourse to this dreadful idea of holding a referendum in order to put off these constitutional changes indefinitely.
That must not happen.
Hannes Swoboda, Joost Lagendijk and I will try to bring influence to bear on our Macedonian colleagues over the next two days.
I also think it is very important for an amnesty to be granted in whichever way is appropriate under the laws of the country, but this should not apply to crimes to be investigated in The Hague.
I think we should make a fine distinction here.
Naturally, I very much hope that the parliament will now put in place the laws necessary to strengthen local autonomy and give the minorities - which, after all, are majorities in some regions of the country - the opportunity to take genuine responsibility for their fellow citizens.
I think that if they pursue this course, as Johannes has said, we will have peaceful situations by the end of this year.
Mr President, we support the motion for a resolution, but we find it all very optimistic and hard to believe.
Did the August agreement really ensure that the multi-ethnic society and the single rule of law were in fact maintained?
We say and we hope that it did.
But the only evidence we have at the moment is that weapons are being collected and the National Liberation Army has been disbanded.
However, we do know that determining in advance how many weapons would be handed in was hardly conducive to being taken seriously.
How were the numbers calculated?
Just as we also know that it is the easiest thing in the world for a resistance movement to say that it is disbanding and then to regroup without further ado.
That is why we share the incredulity, the degree of difficulty which the Slav Macedonians appear to be having in making further progress.
We hope they will make progress.
We want to remain optimistic, but the only serious argument for being optimistic and supporting the line taken in the motion would be, first, a stable political line, not double and triple messages coming out of the European Union and ÍÁÔÏ, as has happened in the past, with catastrophic results at political level; secondly, real, generous financial assistance - and soon - and, thirdly, to give European prospects to all the Balkan states at long last, and to this particular country as quickly as possible, so that there is a way out of the crisis, hope and prospects.
Mrs Pack has, I think, rightly pointed out that there are still many problems in front of us.
But all in all, the peace process in Macedonia may still be considered a small miracle.
I fully agree with the words of Mr Haarder in congratulating the Macedonian government and pointing to the courage that government has shown.
Indeed, ladies and gentlemen, a Gordian knot has been cut.
The minority rights of the Albanians are guaranteed, the operation 'Essential Harvest' has succeeded, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Macedonia remains secure.
The multi-ethnic society is indeed being given another lease of life and dialogue is central to the parties.
We must continue to pay attention to this region, to the whole of the Balkan region.
The Afghan crisis, the war on terrorism, must not distract our attention from this part of the world.
We must invest in the stability of the Balkans.
We must invest in the stability of Macedonia.
We must ensure that sufficient support for the execution of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is being granted.
We must provide good guidance for refugees returning home.
We must see to the re-building of that country.
And I wish here to underline the words of Mrs Pack.
The political history of my own country has demonstrated that only forgiveness, only reconciliation can guarantee real peace in a country.
And so amnesty for the revolutionaries is indeed important.
This does not mean the revolutionaries who may possibly be accused before the Court of Justice in The Hague.
It concerns the others, for whom a regulation is required.
I hope that our fellow MEPs who are departing tomorrow for Skopje will be able sufficiently to alert our counterparts over there to this problem.
I also fully support extension of the mandate of the European Agency for Reconstruction in that region.
Macedonia should be brought under the scope of that regulation, and I also hope that we as Members of the European Parliament will be paying enough attention to the work of the European Agency for Reconstruction, so that we may be sure that the European taxpayer' s money is well spent in an efficient and timely manner in that region.
Mr President, if the constitutional changes and reform laws in Macedonia come into force - and we hope that this will happen soon - the country will have minority rights legislation which far outstrips the standards in the majority of European countries and most EU Member States.
We always talk very pompously about European standards - which, in reality, do not exist in this form - and often demand that other countries meet criteria which many of our own EU Member States are not prepared to comply with themselves.
Nonetheless, I am gratified by this positive development in Macedonia, not only in the wake of the most recent acts of violence but over the last two years since the Georgievski government embarked on a reform course in this area.
Once again, the violence has jeopardised this process.
I am pleased that the European Union and other international organisations, including NATO, have succeeded in shoring up the process, so that the reform course has not only continued but has actually improved and accelerated.
However, this should not be a reason for us to fob off the Macedonians with mere thanks, as it were.
Like Mr Haarder, I too believe that we owe them a debt of gratitude.
However, this gratitude must be of a practical nature.
We must finally take action in response to the scandalous handling of the issue of the country's name.
We must finally take action on the financial resources for Macedonia, which must be used to benefit the country as a whole, including the very underdeveloped east and south and not just the capital or the few regions which were particularly affected by the crisis.
What is very important is that we must finally begin to recognise that this country is our partner, based on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
We do not need any special instruments, we do not need a (pseudo) protectorate status, which is obviously still being mooted in some circles, also in connection with the idea of special agencies etc. I regard Macedonia as our partner.
The Association Agreement is the instrument through which we can channel our cooperation.
We must continue to work with Macedonia in partnership and assist it in its progression towards membership of the European Union.
Mr President, we want to start by pointing out that clashes in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are continuing even now, despite the fact that the rebels are supposed to have handed in their weapons and disbanded.
As far as handing in weapons is concerned, the NATO "emergency harvest" operation involving 4,500 men only recouped 3,300 weapons, i.e. not even one gun per NATO soldier, while NATO sources are quoting a figure of tens of thousands of weapons.
Thousands of refugees are still unable to return home and the de facto division of the country continues.
At the political level, the Slav Macedonian parties are under tremendous pressure to make constitutional changes, changes opposed by the majority of the people.
The European Union representative, Mr Solana, is already in Skopje, together with the Commissioner for External Relations, Mr Patten, trying to speed up the process for the so-called "political dimension" of the agreement.
To put it simply, this means that they are exerting pressure to get the fine points of the amendments to the constitution, such as a general amnesty for the rebels, voted through and, more importantly, to avoid a referendum at all costs.
The future of the country appears to the intermediaries to be too important a matter to be left in the hands of its citizens.
The ÍÁÔÏ and European Union operation has not resolved any fundamental problems.
The only thing that foreign intervention has done is to bring the rebels into contact with government officials.
Apart from the NATO corps of 200 soldiers which is now stationed in the country, intolerable pressure is also being exerted by the so-called donor meeting.
We again reiterate our fear that, unless various forms of foreign intervention stop, not only will the communities in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia be unable to ever reach an agreement, they will face a new Kosovo.
Mr President, if the Macedonian Parliament accepts the constitutional changes forced by rebellion and foreign intervention, this means that the large Albanian majority in the north-west regain their rights.
Within the former Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia, the Albanian language was the language of administration and education.
This right was suspended following the independence of Macedonia.
The situation is comparable with the language rights of the Hungarian minority on the southern edge of the equally new state of Slovakia.
National minorities which become a majority often appear to have no understanding for the other language groups within the territory of their state.
In 50 years' time, the roles will be reversed as Albanians come to form the largest group in Macedonia.
Only through an agreement based on equality can two peoples find a way to live peacefully as good neighbours.
In that respect, much can be learned from the government structures of multi-lingual federal states such as Belgium, Switzerland and Spain.
From that perspective I can now, in contrast to 3 May, consent to support for Macedonia.
Mr President, the Commission fully shares Parliament's view that the Framework Agreement of 13 August is crucial to peace and stability in FYROM and that the Macedonian Parliament should be urged to adopt the measures recommended under the agreement.
Commissioner Patten and EU High Representative Solana are in Skopje today to underline the importance of, and convey the urgent need for, constitutional changes and a revised law on local self-government, as foreseen under the agreement.
We face truly formidable challenges over the next few weeks and months in FYROM.
The EU is fully behind the Framework Agreement and is committed to providing financial assistance, including assistance for emergency aid and for measures in support of the agreement.
We have provided over EUR 10 m in humanitarian assistance through ECHO since the crisis began; EUR 54.5 m under CARDS in 2001, which includes a recent top-up of EUR 12 m for housing reconstruction, local infrastructure and support for host families; EUR 12.8 m under the Rapid Reaction Mechanism to repair and reconstruct houses, to repair electricity and to support confidence-building measures, such as mine clearance, election monitoring and police training; and EUR 50 m in macro-financial assistance still to be disbursed from a previous macro-financial package, which is being combined with an additional grant of EUR18 m to help FYROM cope with the specific needs arising from the crisis.
This assistance is, of course, conditional on an IMF agreement with the Macedonian Government.
The Commission and the World Bank are ready to organise a donor meeting on 15 October, provided that the Macedonian Parliament adopts the necessary constitutional changes set out in the Framework Agreement.
It is not an overstatement to say that the effective delivery of EU assistance could be critical to the success of the Framework Agreement and, therefore, to peace.
Our paramount concern is to ensure that we act quickly and flexibly.
We have therefore decided to propose an extension of the European Agency for Reconstruction, which has an excellent track record in delivering assistance throughout the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
The agency has people on the ground and direct experience in the region, notably in the sort of emergency reconstruction that we will need to deliver in FYROM this autumn, as well as in longer-term assistance of the type it is now overseeing, for example in Serbia.
We therefore urge Parliament to give positive consideration to our proposal to extend the mandate of the agency.
Beyond the Framework Agreement, we are determined to pursue a strategy of closer integration of FYROM into the European mainstream, simply, first of all, by implementing the new Stabilisation and Association Agreement signed in April.
A lot has to be done in this area and FYROM must demonstrate that it can live up to international standards by respecting minority rights and show that its democratic structures are stable enough for it to pursue its path towards European integration - in simple terms, to become a member of the European family.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.

United Nations World Day to overcome extreme poverty
Mr President, would dedicating a resolution from this House on extreme poverty on this occasion be giving in to opportunism?
I would like to remind you that on 17 October 1987 Father Wrezinski, with 100 000 people, talked about the life of the poorest families and people in our whole society and since that day, the World Day to overcome extreme poverty reminds us each year that it is our duty to unite in respecting human rights when they are violated.
If we adopt this resolution today, we are paying tribute not only to the commitment of the families and people who face extreme poverty themselves, but also to the commitment of all the associations and citizens who stand beside them.
Also, throughout the European Union, especially since the Lisbon summit, the public, national and European authorities are constantly highlighting the fight against exclusion and particularly the need for an integration policy.
It is in this spirit that today, on behalf of my group, I am presenting this resolution, which asks the Member States to develop real strategies aimed at equal access for all to fundamental rights such as education, housing and healthcare as well as culture and sustainable employment.
It is also in this spirit that we are asking the European authorities and, as far as we are concerned, our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in cooperation with the Commission, to make an assessment of the policies conducted in the field every 17 October and thirdly, we ask, for the future of course, that a stone be laid in the square in front of the European Parliament in Brussels in honour of the victims of poverty like those laid in the squares at the Trocadero in Paris, the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, in Berlin, Rome and at the UN.
It is a simple but nevertheless important tribute that we want to pay today by putting forward this resolution.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I start my speech proper, I wish to take this opportunity to draw the attention of the Secretariat and the Bureau to the fact that, at least in the Portuguese version, paragraphs 2 and 11 of the Resolution are practically identical, probably as the result of a mistake in the drafting of the text.
Perhaps it would be possible, following the vote, to merge the two texts, because they are practically the same.
The purpose of celebrating this day is to discuss the serious nature of social problems as striking as extreme poverty, which affects more than one billion people across the world, who are forced to live on less than one dollar per day.
We do so in the footsteps of the person who proclaimed this day in 1987 and following the decision of the United Nations in 1992, which enshrined it throughout the world.
We must, of course, look at the programmes that we ourselves have put together to attack poverty and social exclusion.
Here I would draw your attention to the resolutions of the Lisbon, Nice and Göteborg European Councils and to the work, on which consensus has already been obtained between Council and Parliament, on the programme of cooperation in the fight against social exclusion.
I wish, once again, to pay tribute to the work of our fellow Member, Ilda de Figueiredo.
Specifically, however, we must have an idea of the problems and of our strategy.
We are facing very old problems that concern world development and we must think about the scandal that is war and corruption in so many countries that subject their citizens to the most abject poverty.
Some things have been done in our countries to combat disease, need and profound social inequalities; there are new challenges that we are aware of, specifically in the context of the information society, but there are also new problems, affecting what we in Portugal call the 'new poor' .
This is a problem that greatly affects pensioners and the elderly and I am sorry that the compromise motion did not go further than it did.
I think that there is a certain prejudice here against talking about the word 'family' , but we must be aware that the weakening of the family unit makes us all more vulnerable. It makes individuals lonelier, which is largely responsible for the contradiction we see today, which is that our societies are richer and, yet, we feel increasingly insecure.
This is highly relevant to this problem, which we must look at seriously and with our eyes wide open.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, poverty in the world is a violation of human rights and an intolerable breach of human dignity.
It affects hundreds of thousands of men, women and children. This poverty has increased in the last six years.
In the European Union there are 65 million people living on less than 60% of the national average income, to say nothing of the differences within the Member States.
It is thanks to social transfers and social assistance systems that the poverty level has remained at 18% in the Union.
But with the slowdown in economic growth, we are in danger of exclusion and poverty being aggravated again.
An analysis of the proposals from the associations and the work of the Intergroup on the European fourth world clearly indicate that the fight against poverty and exclusion should become a vital element of sustainable development.
The objectives set should be pursued and integrated into all policies, with more resources.
I regret that the financial provision for anti-poverty programmes is still inadequate.
The Laeken European Council should adopt political measures on income, employment, housing, health, education, training and culture.
Parliament should also have objectives guaranteeing the right to quality housing for all, against the constant withdrawal of employment and services and re-establishing citizenship and equal rights.
This is also why, on the occasion of the World Day against poverty, which will take place on 17 October, the European Parliament, in cooperation with the associations concerned, should also promote initiatives to raise awareness and to mobilise people to eliminate poverty and destitution.
I hope that this day will enable us to make a further commitment to implementing programmes against poverty, by developing economic and social policies that really deal with the underlying causes of that poverty.
Violations of human rights in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam
Mr President, the prospect of economic reform in Vietnam has certainly improved over the past few years.
However, there is still no progress as far as political reform is concerned.
There is a constant flow of reports about the arrest, detention and ill-treatment of dissidents in Vietnam.
Defenders of democracy, critics of the communist regime, religious communities and former refugees who want to invest in Vietnam are still at great risk.
International human rights organisations are still not getting a hearing from the Vietnamese government.
They are also banned from monitoring developments and carrying out inspections in the country.
The central government is doing its level best to block any form of communication between the dissidents and the rest of the world.
International donors must challenge human rights violations and must call for political reform in Vietnam in addition to economic reform.
I am very much in favour of strengthening the economic ties between the European Union and Vietnam.
However, as one of the country's biggest donors, the European Union must take a firmer stance and do more to ensure that human rights are respected there.
I would also strongly advocate an independent investigation into the well-being of Mr Binh Vinh Trinh and other investors in Vietnam.
Having made a fortune abroad by working extremely hard after fleeing from Vietnam, as many people did a few decades ago, Mr Trinh started investing in his native country again.
However, he was arrested under the pretext of illegal investment, and brainwashed in solitary confinement, all of his possessions were seized and his investments were confiscated.
This acts as a deterrent and naturally has an extremely negative impact on the decisions of other investors.
There must be proper legal protection of foreign investments and investors in Vietnam and the corruption there must be brought to an end.
This is an essential precondition for future economic and political development in Vietnam and her links to the world economy.
In addition, Vietnam must protect, safeguard and guarantee human rights.
There has been absolutely no progress in Mr Trinh's case over the past few months.
He is still on the run and none of his or his family's unlawfully seized possessions have ever been returned to him.
As soon as he sets foot in Vietnam, he will be put straight back into prison.
I call on the government of Vietnam to make a gesture by respecting the rights of Mr Trinh and other investors and those of other political dissidents.
Mr President, twelve years ago, a Czech human rights activist in Prague wanted to appeal to a Western head of government for help in the face of his impending imprisonment.
This Western head of government did not receive him.
A few months later, the human rights activist became President of Czechoslovakia. His name was Václav Havel.
From then on, the Western head of government had a great deal of difficulty in getting an audience with the Czech President, who refused to receive him because he wanted to make it clear that this failure to respond to human rights violations and the flouting of human dignity was unacceptable.
European Union states are pursuing a similar policy today with regard to Vietnam.
It is a policy of autosuggestion.
It is claimed that Vietnam is pursuing a reform course.
It is also claimed that Vietnam no longer has such a repressive regime as before.
Yet the reality sends out a very different message.
Persecution of human rights activists has increased.
Injustice and the suppression of press freedom have increased, as has the suppression of religious freedom.
If we look at the reality of the situation, we must recognise that this regime cannot be set on a reform course without massive external pressure.
Economic and geostrategic interests, too, cannot be sustained in the long term unless there is a stronger emphasis on the rule of law throughout South-East Asia, but especially in Vietnam.
That is why it is in the European Union's interests to abandon its policies of autosuggestion at last and speak out about human rights violations in Vietnam.
The European Parliament adopted this approach with regard to Central and Eastern Europe before 1989.
It was fairly isolated at the time, but events proved that it was right.
The European Parliament is pursuing the same course today on Vietnam, and I appeal to the Commission, and especially, of course, to the Council and Member States to adopt a more pro-active human rights policy with regard to Vietnam and genuinely send out a clear signal, for in this region of the world, we are dependent on this important country, with its great culture, returning to a more democratic course based on the rule of law.
Only then can it be a real partner - also in the economic field - in the long term.
Mr President, Vietnam has once again flouted its international commitments and its own Constitution.
The conviction, following a botched trial, on 26 September, of 14 members of the mountain ethnic groups for having peacefully demonstrated in favour of freedom of religion and the establishment of an autonomous area in their province is a fresh illustration of this acknowledged contempt for human rights.
They went to join the dozens of prisoners of conscience who are rotting in jail in atrocious conditions, while international human rights observers are unable to get into the country to do their job.
The failure to respect individual freedoms should not be tolerated in a country that claims to be democratic and which we have ourselves supported in its fight for independence.
The use of the death penalty - more than one hundred sentences passed in 2000 - is also unacceptable.
Vietnam, which is an economic and trade partner of Europe, and which has also ratified the international convention on civil and political rights, must respect its international commitments and stop persecuting ethnic minorities.
Political liberalisation must go hand in hand with economic liberalisation. Without that, the country cannot be considered by the European Parliament as a democratic State.
Mr President, today I must join with the authors of the joint resolution in standing against the failure to respect human rights in Vietnam.
The European Parliament has spoken out many times on this matter, the last time only three months ago, to condemn the violation of the freedom to practice religion.
The country, which is still run by a Communist party, still represses, on a daily basis, any group or individual considered to be a threat by those in power.
My fellow Members have already said that the freedom of the press, freedom of opinion, religion and association, rights of ownership and the right to vote are flouted.
What is also serious is that no international organisation or independent observer is authorised to come and monitor the human rights situation in the country.
Let us recall that in April, Vietnam celebrated the 25th anniversary of its reunification.
The Vietnamese government, which has signed many international conventions on human rights, had an excellent opportunity on that occasion to reaffirm the commitments it had given in that respect.
Vietnam is demanding a place on the international stage and has potentially everything in its favour to become a prosperous country.
Reality, unfortunately, shows the situation to be quite different.
The Vietnamese people live in poverty, their society is in decline and the country is still under-developed.
By signing a partnership and cooperation agreement with the European Union in 1995, Vietnam gave a formal commitment to respect human rights and promote democracy.
The joint EC/Vietnam Committee that met in September in Hanoi reconsidered all the aspects of relations with the European Union, including the joint agreement on democracy, good governance, human rights and the rule of law.
I call on Parliament today to give its full support to the European Commission in implementing its partnership strategy in the region.
We must all encourage the process of reform in Vietnam.
Respect for fundamental freedoms, freedom of expression and freedom of conscience should constitute the basis of sound and constructive cooperation with that country.

Mr President, Uzbekistan, the land of Bukhara and Samarkand is now in our thoughts as the border country of Afghanistan with Taliban-linked extremists operating in its territory.
We acknowledge that there are human rights problems in that country to be tackled, but we welcome its partnership in the fight against terrorism.
Yet not many of us are aware of the other crisis in Uzbekistan.
Reporters report on the problem and potential problem of refugees in the area.
They do not report on the 13 million people affected by one of the worst droughts in history in the area, that started in the spring of last year.
They do not report that six million children under 14 are affected. They do not report that drinking water and irrigation water is in desperately short supply, that most of the crops in the affected areas have failed, that poor-quality drinking water and sanitation problems have resulted in one of the highest levels of ill health in the region.
They do not report that only 54% of the people in urban areas in Uzbekistan have access to sewage networks, or that only 3% in rural areas have such access.
As a result, parasitic infection is rife and the third cause of infant deaths is diarrhoeal disease.
Malnutrition and poverty have reached crisis point.
We need urgent action to supply essential drugs and equipment, to strengthen water-quality control, to support and monitor nutrition programmes, to train health workers and conduct health education programmes.
We also need to help the country change from its heavy use of agrochemicals, its diversion of rivers and its poor drainage system.
I commend this motion to the House.
Mr President, anyone who visited Uzbekistan during the Soviet era was enchanted by its glorious Islamic heritage, its thriving markets - especially compared with the markets elsewhere in the Soviet Union - and its lively atmosphere.
We are therefore especially concerned about the situation in Uzbekistan today, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. This is no longer a booming country; it is a country in a difficult political situation, scarred by hunger and environmental devastation.
Intensive cotton farming with excessive use of fertilisers has undoubtedly contributed to this environmental disaster.
Furthermore, as the previous speaker has just pointed out, Uzbekistan is now in a situation in which we must fear the worst over the coming weeks and months, especially in light of developments in Afghanistan.
The European Union is called upon to help the region as a whole - for in a situation of economic privation, environmental devastation, and a permanent threat from Islamic fundamentalist or terrorist groups, it would be an even greater disaster if the European Union failed to help the people in this region by supporting them in their efforts to overcome the catastrophic environmental and health situation and assisting them to achieve a modicum of economic prosperity, and above all by providing basic foodstuffs.
I am sure that Commissioner Nielson, who is the appropriate person to participate in this debate today, is already giving thought to these issues and making preparations with his staff for what has to be done today, but above all, what must be done in the event of further disasters, e.g. in response to refugee flows from Afghanistan.
Our task is not simply to deliver great sermons.
This is not a clash of civilisations; it is not a campaign against Islam. What we must do is to take practical action during the coming weeks and months and show the people that we genuinely wish to express our solidarity and support with more than just words.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to fully endorse Mr Swoboda's words.
I am the chairman of the European Parliament delegation for relations with Uzbekistan.
Please allow me to give a personal account today.
Last June I spent an entire week travelling around Uzbekistan with a European Parliament delegation.
We visited the Karakalpakstan region, the region where they are struggling with the serious problems of the Aral Sea.
The situation there is disastrous.
Commissioner, could I have your attention for a moment?
We met the people there.
We met the relief workers.
They expressed their thanks to our delegation, they spoke to us and they gave us messages, but they also told us: We have seen so very many delegations come and go.
When will something finally be done about the water problem in our region?
When will the European Community, when will the whole international community help us to actually do something together with the other countries in this region?
The situation there is disastrous, including in the area of public health.
Mr Wiebenga and I visited the local hospital in Nukus where patients with TB are treated.
The situation there is degrading.
The sewers in the basement are broken.
They are absolutely overflowing with human excrement.
There are mosquitoes flying around.
The stench there is unbearable.
Patients have to keep the flies and mosquitoes off their bodies, with the result that patients who should really be staying for three months leave. They go home.
They infect members of their families. They infect other people around them.
I believe that as an international community we must take our responsibility seriously.
I therefore hope that the Commissioner will be able to promise us some concrete measures soon.
Otherwise the text of the resolution that is before us receives my unqualified support.
East Timor
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, East Timor is the first new State to emerge freely and democratically onto the international stage at the start of the new millennium.
The European Parliament must take pleasure in this result.
The issue of East Timor has been on our international agenda for a number of years.
We have given voice to those who have fought to return dignity to the Timorese people and to have their right to decide on their own destiny recognised and we have condemned the violation of human rights by Indonesian troops and by militias sponsored by them.
I must emphasise the work undertaken by so many Members of this House.
In particular, I wish to refer to Carlos Costa Neves, who has chaired the inter-group 'For East Timor' and who has taken part in each of the European Parliament' s missions to that country.
We may have helped the people of East Timor to regain freedom and democracy, but we also have a responsibility for helping them to consolidate their gains.
East Timor needs help from the international community: political, technical and financial help. Without this assistance, it will not be possible to rebuild what was destroyed, assemble a new administration and ensure the necessary development.
This is why we call on the international community: to provide more support and assistance.
Our compromise resolution, therefore, calls for an extension of the United Nations mandate, for the return of the refugees who wish to return to their countries and for the fight against the impunity of those who have committed crimes and who have violated fundamental rights.
Lastly, I must say that I am glad to see a considerable degree of consensus and multiparty support for the candidature of Xanana Gusmão for the Presidency of East Timor.
This Sakharov prize-winner could be a reference point for unity and could make a fundamental contribution to consolidating the new democratic institutions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, normally at this stage in the proceedings, we discuss accidents, disasters, calamities and all manner of things that cause us deep sadness and pain.
As Mr Coelho has already said, East Timor used to be one such case.
Today, however, is a joyous occasion.
What we have seen and heard today is the success of the process in Timor.
At this moment, I should also like to tell this House of the gratitude of the Portuguese and, of course, of the Timorese people, for the increasing solidarity that their cause has enjoyed in the European Parliament and which has spread throughout the world.
Mr Coelho has already mentioned the various resolutions and the high point, which was the award of the Sakharov prize to Xanana Gusmão, the distinguished leader of the Timorese resistance, who will be, by broad national consensus, the next President of the country.
This should serve as an example to us of how, with tenacity and patience, we can achieve positive results and help good causes.
Three years ago, anyone in this House who said that this would really be happening today would definitely have been called crazy.
Three years ago, we could not have imagined the referendum of August 1999 and the overwhelming consensus of the Timorese people.
It would have been impossible to imagine that the tragic crisis following the referendum would be overcome and that, on 30 August this year, we would have the first elections of a new, free and independent State.
We must continue to help East Timor.
We made a major contribution to winning the independence for which they were fighting, in defence of their identity.
We must keep this sense of responsibility alive and remain vigilant to the potential dangers in a geo-political context that remains highly uncertain.
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the East Timorese people on the conduct of the peaceful and democratic elections for the Constituent Assembly on 30 August.
I am particularly honoured to be able to speak about East Timor today as I was the Chief Observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission in the country between 23 August and 11 September, and was able to see for myself just how important these elections were for the people of East Timor.
Before I turn to substantive issues, however, I would first like to congratulate UNTAET and especially Sergio Vieira de Mello on their work, which was often carried out under very difficult conditions.
I would also like to pay tribute to the work of the Independent Electoral Commission, the European Commission both here and in East Timor, and the smooth cooperation with UNDP, the Embassy of Portugal, and the Belgian EU Presidency.
East Timor has taken the first step towards independence and the founding of a separate state.
What is especially important now is the continued support of the international community and the European Union, for the country faces enormous challenges.
It is therefore essential that the UN peacekeeping units and civilian police remain in the country until East Timor is able to take over these security tasks itself.
The EU Member States must lobby hard for this with the United Nations.
It is important for the European Union and the United Nations, as well as other donor countries such as Portugal and Germany, to continue their technical and financial assistance, for the Commission and the Council to take a positive stance on East Timor's application for accession to the ACP - the "Everything But Arms" Initiative, for example, could take effect immediately - and for the EU to support the East Timorese government in developing a master plan for the country's development.
In this context, the EU should focus particularly on rural development and health.
The entire administrative sector must also be strengthened and, in some areas, built up from scratch.
However, it is education, above all, which will be the basis for and a key element of all the development projects - for one thing is clear: these democratic elections are an extremely important step for the country's future.
However, we must not forget that this is just the first step out of many which must be taken towards a functioning democracy and civil society.
For East Timor's further institutional development, it is also important for the EU to participate in the arrangements for the presidential elections and the necessary voter education.
There are many other examples, but one thing, above all, must not be allowed to happen: we must not withdraw from responsibility now that the foundation stone for an independent state has been laid and abandon the people who are only gradually beginning to recover from the trauma of the dreadful events of 1999.
Instead, let us be prepared for the fact that our support will continue to be needed for many more years.
As a key factor in this context, the assistance must be coordinated efficiently if it is to achieve its objective.
After my many discussions in the country itself, I am certain that the East Timorese people are aware of the problems facing their country and understand only too well how difficult the way ahead will be.
Let us work together with the East Timorese people as equal partners.
We will also be sending out a positive signal to the international community - that it is possible to resolve problems peacefully and initiate development, especially at the present time.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the tragedy in East Timor, one of the most beautiful pages in recent history has been written.
The principles of an ethical international policy have triumphed in East Timor.
The example of this country gives us further hope that world history is not merely a succession of barbaric acts and cruelty.
At a terrible time, in which fear and apocalyptic concerns prevail, East Timor represents a ray of light and hope.
Elections to the constituent Assembly in East Timor have been the crowning glory of an impeccable democratic process that does honour to the United Nations and, above all, to the people of Timor.
Not all is rosy, however, in Timor as you all know.
It is a very poor country, has an economy to rebuild, a State to organise and health, education and social protection systems to create.
Only with the help of the international community, specifically the European Union, will Timor be able to turn its independence into something marvellous and a fine example for the rest of the world.
My own country, Portugal, will certainly devote a great deal of affection and support to Timor, since it has become both a Portuguese and a universal cause.
Colombia
Mr President, Colombia - one of South America's oldest democracies and a country which, unusually for this continent, has not been prone to military dictatorship - is tragically a victim of 37 years of civil war and terrorist activity, which have destroyed infrastructure, killed 40 000 people and corrupted its civil and military authorities through guerrilla involvement with the drugs trade.
It seems from the events of 11 September in New York that democracies are particularly vulnerable to terrorism, which has no respect for the ballot box as a way to achieve change in societies.
Now - and in spite of Colombian President Pastrana's concession three years ago of a large demilitarised zone the size of Switzerland, where 17 000 of its guerrillas roam at will - the FARC, instead of pursuing a legitimate, peacefully negotiated settlement, continues its policy of kidnapping and murdering civilians.
Last Sunday it killed the much-loved former culture minister, Consuelo Araujo Noguera, and on Tuesday Congressman Octavio Sarmiento.
I am sure that this House will join me in sending a message of condolence to their grieving families.
Pastrana's policy of granting concessions to the FARC, labelled a terrorist organisation by the USA, has remarkable parallels with the policy of Britain's Tony Blair of granting early release to IRA killers without a prior insistence on the arms decommissioning to which they had already agreed.
Curiously, three IRA suspects are currently under arrest in Colombia for advising the FARC on how to conduct murderous campaigns, on which, as we know, the IRA is an expert.
I do not have a clear answer to President Pastrana's dilemma, as only 18% of Colombians in a recent poll supported suspending peace talks, scrapping the demilitarised zone and resuming full-blown civil war.
Only the Colombian Government can decide what is best for the future of its country and what price it is prepared to pay to achieve peace.
Nevertheless, I am sure that, as well as supporting this resolution, this House will join me in praying for the long-suffering people of Colombia and in hoping sincerely that the FARC and the guerrillas will see the folly of their evil ways and that the Colombian Government will achieve a policy of reconciliation without compromising justice or freedom.
Mr President, it would appear from the last speech that the Government of the United Kingdom is responsible for the violence in Colombia.
I would like to state that up to now, in the documentation I have seen, I have not found any involvement by the Government of the United Kingdom in the violence in Colombia.
The fact is that in Colombia people are being killed - the revolutionaries (the FARC) kill them, the paramilitary organisations linked to the Government kill them - and to make any kind of pronouncement right now as to the guilty parties in Colombia seems premature to me.
At present there is a situation of violence and those responsible for that violence are in fact the Europeans, because we Europeans left in Colombia, as in many other countries, a trail of injustice, of social differences, which persist to this day.
The European Union has been concerned with Colombia for a long time.
Unfortunately, we have not been able to influence events in a very positive way.
But we have at least succeeded in increasing the country' s economic activity to the point where, today, 40% of Colombian exports are destined for the countries of the European Union.
I believe that in the European Union we are faced with a somewhat desperate task, because the years are passing and the violence continues.
The violence also affects us closely.
For example, in Madrid, forty Colombians have been assassinated in the last six months by Colombian drug trafficking organisations, by hired assassins who come specially from Colombia to kill their fellow citizens.
If the events of 11 September have demonstrated anything it is that violence in the world has no limits, that in a globalised world violence affects us all and that therefore, any action we take in a faraway country such as Colombia ultimately benefits our own citizens as well.
We have to protect our citizens and the citizens of the whole world in lands as remote as Colombia.
I know that the Commission and the Council are restricted in terms of achieving such results.
If the Colombian Government, if a large number of people dedicated to achieving the pacification of the country in the country itself (writers, intellectuals, etc.) have failed to achieve those results, it is unlikely that we will be able to achieve them, but I believe - I am availing myself of the presence of the Commissioner, who deals with a very sensitive area concerning this issue, to say this - that we should continue our efforts.
Rather as in the myth of Sisyphus, we should continue rolling the stone from the bottom of the mountain to the top, despite all events to the contrary.
I am convinced that both the Commission and the Council will agree with Parliament on continuing to help the Colombian Government and the political leaders of good faith of that country to find a solution to put an end to the escalation of violence, which seems to be plunging Colombia, that magnificent and stupendous Latin American country, ever more into the abyss.
I therefore hope that, between the three institutions, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, we may help in some measure in the pacification of Colombia.
Mr President, the political violence in Colombia is a crucial obstacle to peace and development in the country.
No other country in the world has as many murders of active trade unionists as Colombia.
The Colombian Left has been, and continues to be, subject to a terror campaign without parallel.
Unfortunately, there is a clear risk that the violence will be further stepped up ahead of the presidential election.
The resolution criticises both the guerrillas and the paramilitaries for the violence.
Criticism can fairly be levelled at the guerrillas for kidnappings and violence against the native population.
However, it is quite clear that the paramilitaries are responsible for the majority of the political violence.
At least 90 percent of the political murders are carried out by the paramilitaries or the military.
The paramilitaries would not be able to conduct their campaign of terror without indirect support from, and acceptance by, the regular police and military.
Therefore, Colombia' s government also has direct responsibility for stopping the paramilitaries' campaign of terror in the country.
The EU' s role must be to uphold human rights, support the peace process and oppose the military escalation of the conflict inherent in Plan Colombia.
The demilitarised zone must therefore, also continue as an important precondition for dialogue between the government and the FARC guerrillas.
Colombia can only achieve peace and real democracy if human rights are respected.
If it is not possible for Colombia' s Left to operate openly and legally, without having its representatives murdered, the guerrillas will not lay down their weapons.
It is therefore crucial that the terror campaign against the Colombian left is recognised and combated.
This applies especially to the Unión Patriótica, to which the murdered Member of Parliament Octavio Sarmiento belonged.
The Unión Patriótica has had at least 4 000 of its members shot by the paramilitaries.
Criticism of this could have been expressed even more clearly in this resolution which we are about to adopt. Despite this, we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left believe that the text of this resolution is sound, and it is vital that, in the future, we carefully monitor and react to developments in Colombia.
Mr President, "Chronicle of a Death Foretold" was the title of a novel by García Márquez, that has now become a sad reality in the birthplace of the winner of the Nobel Prize for literature.
The eight bullets that assassinated Yolanda Cerón, head of social care in Tumaco, were also foretold and once and for all destroyed the already precarious working conditions of human rights activists on the ground.
For a year the paramilitaries have reigned in the town of Nariño.
The government lets them do as they will and the list of the dead gets longer.
Just before killing Yolanda, the paramilitaries publicly executed thirteen peasants in Teima.
On Sunday morning, the former Culture Minister, who had previously been kidnapped, Consuelo Araujo Noguera, was murdered during a chase between the army and the guerrillas.
Then, the day before yesterday, the paramilitaries assassinated Octavio Sarmiento, a Member of the National Congress.
We know that anyone who defends human rights in Colombia is a target for the paramilitaries.
A clean-up campaign was even announced in August.
The government had already withdrawn the legal basis for the existence of the paramilitaries in 1989, but has never done anything to seriously dismantle them.
On the contrary, the law on defence and national security, ratified by President Pastrana in August, made the situation even worse.
The law, which is a real blank cheque for all sorts of violations of human rights, extends the army' s powers and freedom to act in a frightening way and reduces the power of the public prosecutor.
The close links between the army and its illegal right arm, the paramilitaries, is well known and the "Human Rights Watch" report, published today, only serves to underline this.
The European Union needs to question the bases of its cooperation with Colombia.
We are still waiting for the first six-monthly report on the progress of human rights in Colombia promised one year ago.
If the European Union takes defending human rights seriously, it should explain its criteria and mechanisms for evaluation and effective protection to us.
If it takes the peace process seriously, it should encourage the pursuit of dialogue between the government and the guerrillas, categorically exclude the paramilitaries from the negotiations and support the report from the committee of experts, published on 28 September.
Finally, if it takes its own commitment to legal reform seriously, the first thing the European Union must do is to support the widespread calls for the law on defence and national security to be repealed.
Mr President, I will respond to each of the five issues.
The UN World Day to overcome extreme poverty is a welcome opportunity to highlight the continuing unacceptable levels of poverty and social exclusion across the world and to stress the need to intensify efforts for their eradication.
Being able to lead a life free from poverty and social exclusion is a fundamental human right.
While the challenge of combating poverty and social exclusion is particularly acute in developing countries, it also remains an issue of major concern within the European Union.
The most recent available evidence shows that 18%, or over 60 million of our population in the EU, are at risk of falling into the category of being among the relative poor.
This is a very high figure.
At the European Councils of Lisbon, Nice and Stockholm, Member States made a commitment to promote sustainable economic growth and quality employment which will reduce the risk of poverty and social exclusion as well as strengthening social cohesion in the Union between 2001 and 2010.
The intention is to reaffirm and further enhance the importance of the European social model and to ensure that social policy has an equal status alongside economic and employment policies and that all three reinforce each other.
To underpin their commitment, the Council developed common objectives in the fight against poverty and social exclusion.
It also agreed that these objectives be taken forward by Member States from 2001 onwards in the context of two-year national action plans against poverty and social exclusion.
Furthermore, the Council established a new open method of coordination which encourages Member States to work together to improve the impact on social inclusion of policies in fields such as social protection, employment, health, housing and education.
The national action plans and the development of comparable indicators provide the framework for promoting exchange of good practice and mutual learning at Community level.
This will be supported from 2002 by a five-year Community action programme on social inclusion which was finalised following a successful conciliation session involving Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 18 September.
All Member States submitted their national action plans against poverty and social exclusion during June this year.
The Commission has been analysing these reports and expects to adopt a draft joint inclusion report on 10 October.
This will be the first time that there has been such an EU-level analysis documenting and comparing the situation on poverty and social exclusion across all Member States.
It is intended that the joint report will be adopted at the Employment and Social Policy Council at the beginning of December so that it can be tabled and reviewed at the Laeken European Council.
Parallel to the work on the national action plans against poverty and social exclusion, work has been going on to develop a list of common indicators in the field of social inclusion.
This will also be presented to and adopted at the Laeken European Council.
On the basis of these developments, the Laeken European Council is expected to define the priorities and approaches that will guide efforts and cooperation at Community level.
The issues and concerns raised in the debate on these resolutions are thus well reflected in the initiatives that are being taken.
However, a key challenge for the future will be to ensure that all Community decisions, in economic and employment as well as social, policies, are assessed for their impact on social cohesion.
While a lot is now happening, there is no room for complacency.
Days like the United Nations World Day for the eradication of poverty provide an important opportunity to remind us of the urgency of the challenge we face if we are to build a more inclusive and peaceful world free from the scandal of poverty and social exclusion.
Looking at the global aspect of this challenge, the first and most important point of criticism is the pathetic level of official development assistance, which is now 0.24%, far from the 0.7% that was promised.
This is where everyone will be looking on that World Day and we must come up with a European answer to that problem.
Another issue we will be facing is financing for development in March next year.
Ôhe policy of the European Union towards Vietnam, as to all other countries, is to encourage and support continued progress on human rights and democratisation, and to raise concerns both publicly and in private where abuses or any deterioration in the situation are observed.
We have to draw attention, however, to the tendency of the Vietnamese administration to want to control the pace of change and to maintain "social cohesion" during transition to a market economy.
Of course, I do not need to remind you that the European Union is opposed to capital punishment.
In the case of Vietnam, the number of offences where the death penalty can be applied was reduced last year.
Juvenile offenders, pregnant women and nursing mothers were also excluded.
We welcome this progress, but we want to see the abolition of the death penalty altogether.
Our principal concern remains that of freedom of opinion.
The original "offence" of Professor Nguyen Dinh Huy in 1992 was to be a co-founder of the "Movement to Unite the People and Build Democracy" a movement supported by Vietnamese exiles in North America.
Before that, he had been an active anti-Communist.
The detention and interrogation of 15 people last month reported by Human Rights Watch was apparently linked to a request to the government to set up an independent "National Association to Fight Corruption" .
The common thread in all these cases is that, despite some real progress, Vietnam remains a country little accustomed to public dissent.
The situation of the Montagnards in the central provinces arose from a complex set of unresolved old problems, but was certainly exacerbated by the lack of effective channels of communication between the local people and the central government.
What is needed in Vietnam is continued progress in the country' s reform programme, so that the administration learns to deal with a wider range of views and to appreciate the value of accommodating dissent in the system of government.
When Mr Patten was in Hanoi last July he took the opportunity to raise some of these concerns with the Vietnamese Foreign Minister.
Next month, we will be holding in Hanoi a meeting of the EC-Vietnam Joint Commission, at which all aspects of our relations will be reviewed, including our shared commitment to respect for human rights.
We shall continue to raise particular issues of concern and individual cases and to encourage continued progress on human rights in Vietnam.
On the situation in Uzbekistan, the Commission shares the European Parliament' s concern about the present situation in Central Asia.
It is clear that the drought is causing damage in the Aral Sea area and particularly in Western Uzbekistan.
For example the Amu Darya, where the major problems lie, is reported to have 70% of the normal water level in its upper reaches and just 40-45% in the lower stretches.
In addition to natural causes, some structural reasons can explain the present situation such as poor maintenance of water-irrigation systems, inadequate water management at regional level between the newly independent states, and agricultural practices which are water demanding such as rice and cotton.
Lack of sustainability would be the short version of what this is all about.
The July 2001 UN assessment mission to Western Uzbekistan has attributed the absence of water to fundamental structural problems (such as irrigation and crop policies).
So what is needed are ways to improve water management and agricultural practice.
These activities are of a developmental nature.
The response so far here is not falling within ECHO's mandate as such.
We are, however, looking at this region from a humanitarian aid point of view, where we see a real risk of a negative fall-out from the situation in Afghanistan.
In fact, ECHO will include a strengthening of the ability to do something relating to this part of the world in a package soon.
The absence of democracy, transparency and accountability, corruption at all levels and misuse of the flow of assistance provided by the international community are all part of the problem.
Since the independence of these countries, no real effort for maintaining the water system has been made.
In addition, national rivalries between the countries in the region have blocked cooperation and also international efforts have been made more difficult.
We have been active in Central Asia in trying to develop long-term projects linked with the structural causes of the drought.
A Tacis programme has been developed to fight against the consequences of the drying of the Aral Sea.
The Commission thinks that only long-term reform by the Uzbekistan Government itself can solve the current problem.
Emphasis should be put on: the creation of alternative forms of employment in the drought-affected areas to improve the irrigation systems in use in these affected areas and, in general, improve water conservation; the introduction of more drought-resistant and less water-hungry crops through further research into new crops, pilot schemes, model farms and whatever is necessary to farm in a sustainable manner in this environment.
Definitely a more effective allocation of water throughout the region is needed.
We hope that Tacis can develop activities to address these issues, in particular at regional level, but the challenge is huge relating to our actual means.
Let me turn to East Timor.
The democratic elections on 30 August were a cornerstone in the transition towards independence.
The Commission was pleased to see how peacefully the electoral process took place.
The outcome - with no two-thirds majority for a single party - will require the Constitutional Assembly to work together and to seek a consensus.
This will hopefully stabilise the political landscape even further.
I think we can be justly proud of the contribution made by the European Union election observer team, and I am happy to congratulate Mr Kreissl-Dörfler on his leadership of the team of 24 Observers.
We will certainly look into the possibility of sending another observer team to the presidential elections in 2002.
In general, I am very pleased with the cooperation with the Parliament and Parliament can be pleased with itself because of its ability to deliver high-quality electoral observation.
The next steps in the formal process will be the adoption of a constitution, hopefully before Christmas this year, followed by the election of a head of state by popular vote, probably around May 2002.
Then will come the withdrawal of UNTAET and the declaration of independence.
This process seems to be well on track.
At the same time, the evolution of the political process appears to be equally well under way.
The highly commendable performance of UNTAET, the recent nomination of an interim cabinet and the further "timorisation" of management functions in the administration have all contributed to this process.
East Timor' s regional anchorage will add an additional foundation.
East Timor is at an historical juncture.
The emergency phase is over.
We now have the chance to get the ambitious independence process right.
The international community has to consider now the long-term development issues.
The Canberra Donors' Meeting last June outlined the current, clearly unsustainable, economic situation and signalled the need for further international assistance.
There is a narrow tax base, a lack of skilled entrepreneurs, and rural poverty leading to demographic pressure on the urban areas.
But there is a realistic perspective for substantial oil revenues coming on stream around 2005-2006.
This could change the picture dramatically.
The national budget could double and could hopefully ensure financial cover for basic state functions, as well as some stimulus for the economy.
We need to support the effort of the East Timorese to manage these oil activities better than what we have seen in many other developing countries.
Statistics will tell us that it should not be very difficult to do it much better, which may not even be good enough, but definitely it is an opportunity.
I would say that so far, so good.
It would be wonderful to have best practice demonstrated in this field.
Lack of transparency in this area is case-by-case across the world the real reason for a lot of trouble.
Against this politico-economic background, and as one of the major donors for East Timor, the Commission has identified its future role accordingly.
We anticipate the need to support one of the poorest countries on Earth until oil revenues provide a more stable economic basis.
We will seek to create a development relationship based on a partnership philosophy.
This means taking a realistic view of all the requirements.
We are currently drafting a Country Strategy Paper, outlining the sectors.
Most likely rural development and public administration will be where we concentrate our activities, suggesting appropriate financial targets for 2002-2006 within these sectors.
This is how we will try to do it: focussing both on poverty alleviation and capacity building.
As was said in the debate, East Timor will also be able to benefit from the 'Everything But Arms'Initiative, helping it to develop its foreign trade.
Finally, I turn to Colombia.
The Commission shares the deep concern expressed by Parliament concerning the deterioration of the situation in Colombia, in particular, the continuation of human rights violations.
The Commission is seriously concerned with the situation of the Peace Process in Colombia after the recent events that have taken place and it is waiting for the evaluation of this process announced by President Pastrana.
The Commission intends to maintain its support to the Colombian people through ECHO.
EUR 10 m are being spent this year.
In addition, the Commission has approved under its human rights budget, four new NGO projects worth over EUR 3 m.
As announced by myself in Brussels on 30 April at the third meeting of the Support Group for the Colombian Peace Process, the Commission is currently finalising its proposal for a programme of a "Peace Laboratory" in the Magdalena Medio region in Colombia.
This programme envisages the support of actions and movements already being implemented by civil society at local and regional level.
The Commission sincerely hopes that conditions on the ground will allow an early implementation of this programme.
The Commission will continue encouraging the Colombian Government and all other relevant political forces to remain strongly committed to the peace process in Colombia, especially during this time of unrest.
As Mr Medina Ortega said, this reminds us very much of the labours of Sisyphus.
It is true that it is hard to see progress, but there is no doubt that any relaxation or any type of giving up would definitely make things worse.
This is our simple analysis and this is why we continue.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, at 6.30 p.m.
Southern Caucasia
The next item is the joint debate and then the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0618/2001 by Mr Haarder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on developments in relations between the European Union and the Southern Caucasus;
B5-0624/2001 by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on developments in relations between European Union and the Southern Caucasus;
B5-0630/2001 by Mrs Schleicher and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the Group PPE-DE, on developments in relations between European Union and the Southern Caucasus;
B5-638/2001 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the Southern Caucasus;
B5-0649/2001 by Mr Linkohr and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on developments in relations between the European Union and the Southern Caucasus;
B5-0661/2001 by Mr Gahrton and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on developments in relations between the European Union and the Southern Caucasus.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour and also a little impertinent to speak before the Chairperson of my delegation, Mrs Schleicher, whom I would have preferred to follow.
However I thank Mrs Schleicher, Mr Posselt and my other colleagues who have contributed to raising, and now, debating a subject that is forgotten, that of the Southern Caucasus.
I dare to hope that following the tragedy in New York and Washington, some of us have been made more aware of the importance of this area of the world, of the importance of a region that is in fact the doorway to central Asia, now a hostage of the Russian Federation, as is, to a large extent, not only the Southern Caucasus but also the Northern Caucasus, which is in an even more tragic situation, whether Commissioner Nielson likes it or not.
The Northern Caucasus, as we all know, is experiencing the tragedy of Chechnya, a tragedy that is continuing and that sees opposition from the European Union.
The resolution before you contains a number of very specific proposals.
Most importantly, the Commission and the Council have been asked to draw up an overall strategy for this region of the world, a strategy that could reverse the current constant tendency towards the deterioration of the situation.
The reason that living conditions in Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan are so difficult, particularly Armenia and Georgia, is the constant, daily work of the Russian Federation, which the European Union is not acting against in any specific way.
This is so true that even an apparently harmless issue such as the opening of delegations in Bakou and Armenia has not yet been resolved by the Commission.
The problem has been raised on numerous occasions by this House, by Mrs Schleicher as Chairperson of the delegation with those countries.
During our meetings in Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia, we have been asked to speak many times.
We have done so and we still have not had an answer.
This is a case that has been open not only for a few months, but for a few years.
Either the European Union must understand that this region is strategically important, particularly for its energy supply, and start to discuss and propose a policy, or in a few months' or a few years' time we will witness the birth of the new Balkans, a little further away from us and therefore perhaps a little less uncomfortable than the Balkans of the 1990s.
I think, nevertheless, that it is up to the European Union to give a response.
These countries are part of Europe, they are already members of the Council of Europe, they feel European and in their heart of hearts - they do not dare to ask openly because the Commission and the Council have made it understood that it would not be very appropriate - their ruling classes want to belong to the European Union.
We need to respond with action, with investment, we need to re-establish confidence, we need to take our entrepreneurs, investors and companies there.
It is quite a small market but, and I repeat this especially for the benefit of the Commission, it is the gateway to central Asia, a strategic region which, as we have seen over the last few weeks, is particularly unstable.
I therefore think that the European Union urgently needs to strongly intervene in this region.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, due to the tragic events of recent months, foreign and security policy is currently at the top of the public's agenda.
In the light of the events in the Middle East and America, it is easy to forget that the situation in the Caucasus is just as explosive.
The problems faced by Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan - including the relations between these three states - still give cause for concern.
Political instability repeatedly threatens the still incomplete independence process.
As a result, violent conflict within these countries is often the focus of public attention.
Yet the history of Europe - especially the history of the European Union - shows that despite the differences and conflicts of interest between states, it is possible to form alliances and thus transcend borders.
Where war once dominated the scenario, we now have peaceful and democratic co-existence.
It is based on the establishment of democratic structures and an emphasis on commonalities, which helped the Western European states to overcome their differences.
In the light of the global coalition against terrorism in all its forms which has emerged since the dreadful attacks on the USA on 11 September 2001, there is thus a need to support the states of the Southern Caucasus in their efforts to combat terror and violence which, sadly, are still a feature of daily life in these countries and threaten many people's lives every day.
The region's democratic structures are still quite new and fragile.
The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that disunity is incited from outside, and the neighbouring states in this region could try to impede or halt the democratisation process for their own interests.
For these reasons, one of the European Union's key tasks must be to give more support to the democratisation process in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Democracy is the only basis for lasting internal stability which in future will also transcend borders.
However, the European Union and the present Belgian Presidency should focus solely on providing assistance and support; under no circumstances should they intervene in these countries' internal affairs.
In specific terms, this means promoting these states' cooperation and cohesion, also as regards the possibility of a free trade area which must be set up without external influence.
The initial elements of trilateral cooperation are already in place; however, they must be expanded and supported in order to counter existing external influences successfully.
If these countries' shared rich cultural heritage is integrated into this process, I am confident that in the medium and long term, important results and successes can be achieved.
As Chairman of the European Parliament's Southern Caucasus delegation, I regard the EU Ministerial Troika's visit under the Swedish Presidency last February as the basis for necessary initiatives.
The joint motion for a resolution tabled by seven parliamentary groups signals the broad agreement between Members of the European Parliament on this issue.
I hope that the Commission, too, will make our concern its own.
Mr President, I think it would be useful if we concerned ourselves with the Caucasus, possibly with permanent observers and little rhetoric.
This historical moment is pushing us towards regional cooperation even in destabilised areas and towards perhaps unforeseen alliances in the interests of greater stability.
If I wished to make a point about the resolution, it would be this: the three countries - Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia - perhaps should not always be treated like Siamese triplets: their recent histories differ, their problems differ and their efforts to build a genuinely democratic system differ.
It would be unfair if any of the three had to wait until the others caught up in the democratisation process.
In this context it would, of course, also be necessary to analyse what the West and the major countries have done in such regions and to analyse, for instance, whether the ethnic revolts in Georgia are local or led from outside, and if so by whom.
I would then like to know why we hear so little about the Minsk Group, founded to seek a compromise between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Is it still meeting?
Even that is not clear.
The European Union should develop a political role that is more obviously adventurous and daring in the region, as the document states - this is the main message - beyond the conference of the three Southern Caucasus states and the European Union.
Given the situation, however, a discrete presence of Russia and America might be considered somewhat useful for a proper balance.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, how far is the European Union going to let the situation in the countries in the Southern Caucasus deteriorate before it finally decides to fully commit itself to the region, in keeping with local and regional expectations?
Europe needs to provide enough funds to support its policies, and that is far from being the case for the Caucasian regions.
A few months ago in this House, members of the delegation for relations with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia urged the European Union to become involved and to commit to a firm and determined policy for the region, where geo-strategic interests are at stake that are both significant and varied.
We cannot continue to say one thing and mean another.
Our commitments need to be followed by specific actions.
Implementing a Commission delegation in each of the countries would send out a strong political signal.
It would be irresponsible to make these countries, who are struggling to affirm their identity, complete their transition process and establish a real democracy, believe that they can count on the political support of the European Union when the reality is that nothing is actually taking place and secretly it is only the oil and gas in the Caspian sea that are of interest.
That would be unacceptable.
Although the Swedish presidency took an initial step by visiting the countries concerned, what has actually been achieved?
And has the report by Mr Gahrton, not been put back to a later date in the schedule?
Moreover, as my fellow Members have said, this is a matter of urgency: does the OSCE not describe the situation as a state of no war?
Let us not forget the powder keg of the impassioned claims on Nagorno Karabakh and the desire for independence of some regions of Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
Yes, Mr President, yes Commissioner, the European Union has an essential role to play in this region.
It should take the initiative of a Europe/Caucasus conference with the various States in order to establish, through a non-violent solution to the conflicts, lasting peace and sustainable development.
Mr President, we pointed out years ago that the Caucasus and Central Asia threatened to become the Balkans of the future.
Hardly anyone has shown any interest in this region; among the heads of government, only the Pope seems to have shown any concern, and what the Pope is among the heads of state, Ursula Schleicher is here in the European Parliament. She has shown exemplary commitment to this often forgotten region.
My fear is that the events of 11 September will be misused in order to create new spheres of influence, with entire nations and ethnic problems being forgotten or sacrificed to energy supply interests.
After President Putin's speech in the Reichstag, many people have forgotten that he was the person who reignited the war in Chechnya, and that as the head of the secret service under Mr Yeltsin, he incited and manipulated the conflicts in Migrelia and Nagorno-Karabakh.
This is why these European regions are entitled to our solidarity, and we must ensure that we have a presence there.
I therefore appeal to you, Commissioner, to put President Putin's words to the test.
If he is genuinely interested in improving the situation, tell him you are going to Chechnya, that you want to test the water for more openness and a greater presence for the European Union.
As regards the three states of the Southern Caucasus, we need Commission delegations at last, not only in Georgia but also in the other two states.
This is a region which affects Europe's vital interests, not only in strategic and energy supply terms, but also as regards human rights and our cultural links with this region.
The EU has strengthened its ties with the region since the entry into force of the partnership and cooperation agreements with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia in 1999.
Since the EU Ministerial Troika's visit to the Southern Caucasus last February the EU has been looking for further ways to support efforts to prevent or resolve conflicts, as well as contributing to rehabilitation.
A Political Directors Troika visit followed in September.
The EU is also stepping up its dialogue with the relevant interlocutors, including Russia, Turkey and Iran.
It is true that what could be called "frozen conflicts" are a serious impediment to the development of the region.
The EU is keen to see further and rapid progress made by the OSCE Minsk Group for Nagorno-Karabakh, the OSCE Joint Control Commission for South Ossetia and the UN Group of Friends of the Secretary-General for Abkhazia.
The Commission has participated in the Joint Control Commission for South Ossetia since April 2001 and provides funds for rehabilitation projects.
External actors such as Russia, Iran and Turkey play a key role in the region.
Any effort to stabilise the Caucasus will have to take their interests into account.
In particular, the role of Russia is paramount.
The EU has raised the issue of developments in the Caucasus in its political dialogue with Russia, supporting all efforts to defuse tensions and resolve conflicts.
In particular, we have encouraged Turkey to explore any opportunity for normalising its relations with Armenia.
Mr Dupuis mentioned the issue of our delegations.
I agree that this is a problem but, unfortunately, not one which the Commission can do anything about.
We are a victim of the decisions made in this House on this matter.
It was not the Commission that wanted to limit the number of our delegations to 120.
Our view is that it is normal for the EU to have delegations everywhere.
We are told to open a delegation in one place or another, and at the same time we are asked to stick to that limit.
This is an impossible job.
Please make up your minds and help the Commission to expand the coverage of delegations.
That is my response to the comment made by Mr Dupuis.
Concerning the impact of the work of the support group, we had our last meeting in Russia on 2 August.
I am sorry to inform you that no progress was made there, and so the outlook is not very encouraging.
Turning to Mr Posselt's comment on the risk to this region of negative fallout from the events of 11 September and thereafter, this is something we will include in the analysis.
We will try to release more money for ECHO this year from the emergency reserve.
We are including this region because we fear and predict that humanitarian aid requirements will increase as a foreseeable, indirect consequence of the said events.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Political situation in Myanmar (Burma)
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0622/2001 by Mr Maaten, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Myanmar/Burma;
B5-0639/2001 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the political situation in Burma;
B5-0650/2001 by Mrs Kinnock and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Myanmar/Burma;
B5-0656/2001 by Mr Vinci and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Burma;
B5-0657/2001 by Mrs McKenna and Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in Myanmar/Burma;
B5-0664/2001 by Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Van Orden, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the political situation in Myanmar/Burma.
Mr President, Commissioner, for ten years, a whole world of citizens, politicians and journalists have taken an active interest in, and been horrified by, the fate of Aung San Suu Kyi.
Despite the enormous support she enjoys among the Burmese people and the crushing victory she and her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), won in 1990, she has not been able to take on her leadership role formally.
On various occasions, she has been kept isolated, and now she has been under house arrest for a whole year.
The Nobel Peace Prize and our own Sacharov Prize have drawn attention to her and to her courageous struggle, but they appear not to have swayed the Burmese junta.
The general human rights situation in Burma is alarming.
Representatives of political parties are kept in isolation, thousands of people are in jail for political reasons, dissidents are persecuted and religious and ethnic minorities harassed.
Forced labour and torture are commonplace.
According to Amnesty, there are around 2 000 political prisoners, including journalists and several elected parliamentarians.
The EU Troika and UN observers now confirm that there are some signs of change.
Several prisoners have been released, attitudes towards the NLD have softened and several party offices have been allowed to open.
From a situation in which there was a total refusal to engage in dialogue, discussions have now taken place, and a process of reconciliation may be underway.
It would be very welcome in a country which, for so many years, has been governed by one of the world' s toughest military juntas.
It may be the case that a window of opportunity has now been opened.
In anticipation of further signs and surer indications that the junta really would like to enter into dialogue and accept the demands of the NLD, the EU should not however relinquish its common policy.
When the Council meets at the end of this month to discuss Burma, it is important to keep the sanctions in place for the time being and to keep the pressure up so that the dialogue continues, genuine steps towards democracy are taken, human rights are respected and, especially, Aung San Suu Kyi is released and allowed to take her place as the elected leader of the Burmese people.
Mr President, the situation in Burma is disastrous.
Hundreds of thousands of people are living, without any real humanitarian aid, packed into refugee camps in Thailand, China and Bangladesh.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced into labour or displaced against their will.
The political system is corrupt and repressive.
The democratic opposition has been suppressed since it was elected on 27 May 1990, and more than 2000 people are in prison.
Amnesty International condemns the institutionalised torture that takes place in these countries.
All these human rights violations are crimes against humanity that need to be stopped and denounced in order to be definitively condemned.
Who finances this regime besides the revenue obtained from the illegal sale of drugs?
Well, there is TotalFinaElf, also present in Angola, Congo, Chad and Cameroon, and additionally found to be connected with the sinking of the Erika and in the accident in Toulouse.
I think that this company, and this regime, should be boycotted.
More than ever we need to support Burma' s democrats.
The European Union should affirm that Aung San Suu Kyi is the only real chance for Burma and must take every possible measure as quickly as is possible to move this military dictatorship towards democratic transition.
Mr President, I believe that this is the sixth resolution on the situation in Burma that we have introduced along with fellow MEPs.
It is now more than 10 years since Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi won the election there by a large margin. The country was subsequently taken over by a military dictatorship.
It is also more than 10 years since the elected parliament was dissolved and many of the members of parliament were murdered, went missing or fled.
Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi was imprisoned and then placed under house arrest. Her house arrest continues to this day.
The repression continued even after she had won the Nobel Peace Prize for her peaceful resistance and was subsequently awarded the Sakharov Prize by our Parliament.
This same repression was also unleashed on the population, and in particular on a number of minority groups, with unprecedented viciousness.
Many people fled, with the result that there are many refugees in neighbouring countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Bangladesh and India.
However, there now seems to be some light at the end of the tunnel.
A number of political prisoners have been released and talks have been going on between the junta and Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi.
Nobody knows what the outcome will be, however, and on that point I would like to warn the European Commission against making any premature concessions to the Burmese military government until it is clear that they are genuinely willing to release all political prisoners. Or that they are genuinely willing to stop repressing minority groups.
Or that they will genuinely allow refugees to return.
Or that they intend to restore democracy or allow Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi to take her place as president of Burma.
In December, it will have been 10 years since Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize.
If there are still no positive developments by then, the European Union will have to step up its measures and put a freeze on investments, for example, just as the United States has done.
We call on the Commission and Council to exert more pressure so that democracy can finally be restored in Burma and Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi can take her rightful place.
Mr President, anyone who knows this paradise in South-East Asia as I do, having visited it several times in the last fifteen years, is bound to be appalled by the chronic supply shortages, the catastrophic infrastructural situation and the brutality of this highly repressive regime.
Yet political systems like the regime in Burma/Myanmar only survive if there are enough states and private companies prepared to keep them alive through economic links.
If we want to change the political system, we must also exert appropriate economic pressure.
The double standards involved in calling for democracy while engaging in intensive trade with this country really should stop.
However, this means that pressure must be brought to bear on those who single-mindedly continue to cultivate their economic links with the military regime with utter disregard for the need for democratisation.
Mr President, like the honourable Members of Parliament the Commission welcomes what could be called the positive developments that have occurred in Burma/Myanmar, in particular the on-going talks between Aung San Suu Kyi and the ruling SPDC, the release of a growing number of political prisoners and the reopening of 20 party offices of the National League for Democracy.
This said, it has to be acknowledged that the improvement in the political climate in the last year is clearly only the beginning of a process which now should be further deepened.
Thus, we still need to see a clear move towards a process of constructive dialogue and achieving respect for internationally accepted standards of human rights.
We have no guarantee of irreversibility in this respect, so we have to be cautious and we have carefully noted the advice given by Members in this debate.
We should encourage the government to continue this progress by fully responding to the concerns of the international community, as articulated by the United Nations Special Envoy, Mr Razali.
At this stage, it is very important to strike a careful balance between recognising the progress achieved so far and maintaining a firm pressure for continued efforts, which can pave the way for democratic reforms.
I am convinced that Members share the Commission's hope that the on-going talks will lead to concrete results, which could enable the European Union to consider positive measures to support the process.
As regards the situation of the ethnic minorities, the Commission shares the concerns voiced by Members and remains convinced that a lasting political solution in Burma/Myanmar must be based on agreement between the SPDC, the democratically elected "opposition" and representatives of ethnic minorities.
All EC humanitarian aid to Burma/Myanmar is provided through NGOs or international agencies.
The Commission is currently exploring the possibilities of increasing humanitarian aid to Burma in full compliance with the terms of the EU's Common Position on Burma/Myanmar.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, at 6.30 p.m.
Patenting of human genes
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0633/2001 by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the human gene register BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer);
B5-0641/2001 by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the human gene register BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer);
B5-0651/2001 by Mr Gebhardt and Mr Paciotti, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the human gene register;
B5-0663/2001 by Mr Lannoye and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the human gene register;
Mr President, I regret that I must remain seated.
On 30 March last year, Parliament declared that people and their genes or cells in a natural environment cannot be patented.
However, if a patent is granted to Myriad Genetics, this will create a monopoly situation for one particular company.
This means that there is a danger that certain genetic tests and some of the DNA diagnostic tests in Europe will be commercialised.
Three applications for patents on sequences and applications of a breast cancer gene have now been accepted by the European Patent Office.
Applications from Myriad for patents on the BRCA2 gene are still being processed.
If these patents are awarded, this US company will have a monopoly on the BRCA gene and consequently on the DNA test.
This means that abnormalities in patients from families with a history of breast cancer and ovarian cancer will only be able to be detected with this American test.
If Myriad is going to use a similar system in Europe to the one it uses in the United States, the samples from all future laboratory tests will have to be sent to the United States, which will also be very expensive if the analyses have to be done there.
This means that there is a danger that a monopoly may be created, which will put the quality of European diagnostics at risk.
It also means that the availability of data for analysis purposes and the development of new diagnostic applications in our own molecular and testing laboratories will be limited, which will push up the cost of breast cancer screening and therefore of health insurance.
Not only Parliament but also everyone in society who is involved in this has registered objections in this regard.
We therefore ask for this monopoly position, which is in nobody's interest, to be opposed and the patent application to be rejected.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it will not only horrify a great many women to see that a US company, through the patenting process, has effectively acquired ownership of 'breast cancer genes'.
The fact that in the race for money and profit, a great many people's health is put at risk is enough to make anyone's blood run cold.
Yet this is exactly what threatens to occur following the award of patents on the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes.
As a worst-case scenario, many patients may face delays in the early detection of breast cancer as a result of these patent awards.
Yet with this type of cancer in particular, early detection is crucial to increase the chances of recovery.
Furthermore, the virtual monopoly on test methods pushes costs so high that early detection of breast cancer is no longer available to many women.
Nor should we ignore the extent to which the BRCA patents are impeding research in Europe.
One of the leading cancer research institutes - the Institut Curie in Paris - has highlighted this situation and provided impressive and conclusive proof.
It is very welcome that this prestigious research institute has taken action and, with the support of the French Ministry of Health, is initiating an opposition procedure to the patent award.
This House will certainly not be making a mistake if it supports this position.
A welcome step would be to call upon the responsible agencies to lodge immediate appeals against the award of the BRCA patents with the European Patent Office in Munich.
It is also important that we should appeal to the institutions and governments of the EU Member States to lodge similar appeals as a matter of urgency.
We owe this to the women affected.
This is the least we can do for them at this point.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, next Tuesday, in response to an application by the Netherlands which is supported by Italy and Norway, the ECJ will decide on the Patent Directive's compatibility with the Treaty.
Today, the European Parliament, through its vote, will decide between the reality and the Directive.
The BRCA patents in particular make it clear that the price of medicines is being increased unnecessarily and that monopolies are being created which impede effective diagnosis and therapy and block research into new and useful drugs.
The time has come for the Commission - and I call upon the Commissioner present to make a statement on this issue - to put an end to the conflicts surrounding the interpretation of this Directive, either by amending the Directive or adopting guidelines.
In my view, the Commission should not bury its head in the sand and say, well, we know that many Member States have problems with this Directive because they do not know how to apply it; we know that the European Patent Office interprets it in a particular way.
I therefore urge you to make a statement on this issue.
The human body must not be degraded to biological material.
Human genes or living organisms or elements thereof must not be subject to patent law.
A discovery must not be recast as an invention.
We must prevent monopolies on human genes impeding research into new and useful drugs.
We cannot stand and watch the early detection of breast cancer falling by the wayside simply because patent rights are to be created for something which is not an invention but, at the very most, a discovery.
Action is required not only by the European Parliament - we have, I believe, made it quite clear with this resolution that we are not prepared to stand and watch - but also by the Commission and the Member States.
Mr President, I shall not speak about the subject but on the institutional issues.
This House has already rejected the option of - or, at least, it has refrained from - lodging an appeal with the European Patent Office.
That is only right and proper.
The European Parliament is a legislative body, and as a legislative body, it cannot intervene in current proceedings.
That is simply not possible!
This is one of the fundamental principles of a democracy under the rule of law.
The legislator passes a law - in this case, the Directive - which will be confirmed next week by the European Court of Justice.
Then it will be down to the authorities to apply the Directive and award a patent or not, and the courts will have to decide whether this award or refusal of a patent is lawful.
That is the due process, and no other process exists in a democracy under the rule of law.
That is why the legislator - in this case, the European Parliament - cannot intervene in current proceedings.
The European Parliament has about as much responsibility for this issue as the Commission, or the Green Party congress or a general meeting of Greenpeace.
It is not for the Commission, or this House, or the Greens, or Greenpeace to decide how a Directive should be applied; that is the task of the relevant authorities.
They - and the courts - decide on this issue, nobody else!
And that is how it should be.
Other than that, Ms Breyer, almost everything you said was factually incorrect.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is against the patenting of human genes as such, something we also stated in 1998 when Parliament adopted the Directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions.
However, we believe that the directive does not allow patents for genes as such, if they do not contain an invention, and we supported the directive when it was adopted.
We believe that the fact that, in a debate on topical and urgent subjects, we are now discussing a resolution on certain patents constitutes an abuse. We have therefore not signed the common resolution.
Although we have a Temporary Committee on Human Genetics, where the question of patents constitutes one of the most important issues, the issue of patents is being brought up here so that a general position might be adopted on the matter, and I would like to repeat that this is very wrong.
We really believe that this is an abuse.
There have been no formal opportunities to raise objections, but we believe that Parliament' s rules should be changed.
The fact that just a few people are to discuss the issue quickly here is therefore very wrong.
We also believe that the draft resolution is not entirely correct.
The patent applications which exist, and I have a summary of them here, expressly state that they apply to methods and not to genes as such.
You are attempting to give the impression that the European Patent Office is now about to approve patents on human genes, and this is not the case.
However, there is one point on which we can agree with those who drew up the proposal, and that is that in certain respects the patents are two 'broad' .
This means that we should review issues such as compulsory licences with an eye to research and public health.
Unfortunately, this is not something that can be dealt with at Community level, but is the responsibility of the Member States.
I hope that we can discuss the issue of licences in peace and quiet in the Committee on Human Genetics.
We shall not be able to support the resolution.
Mr President, while Mrs Thors was speaking the Commissioner was interrupted by two different people, so he was not paying attention to what she asked and what she said.
It was vitally important to me, as someone trying to learn from this debate, to ascertain the facts of the situation.
I was very interested in what Mr Rothley and Mrs Thors said as to whether we should even be discussing this issue in this Chamber.
But Mr Nielson was otherwise distracted.
I would hope that he gives us a proper response when his turn comes to speak.
Thank you very much, Mr Purvis.
The issue of whether or not Mr Nielson was distracted is something we will be able to decide on at the end of the debate.
Mr President, the previous speaker made a comment.
I think that Mr Rothley attacked me personally.
I would like to make it clear once again that the European Patent Office does not have a court.
It has a Board of Appeal.
That is a significant difference.
I say this so that our colleague is properly informed.
It is quite clear that the patent refers to genes - indeed, to mutated genes - and to the analysis procedure, for the sake of accuracy.
I would recommend that any Members of this House who are interested should visit the website of the Institut Curie in France - the prestigious research institute which has initiated an opposition procedure - as this describes the situation in detail.
It is indeed a fact that only an invention may be patented, not a discovery.
On Ms Thors' objection regarding the urgency: the deadline set for instituting proceedings against the first patent expires on Tuesday.
This means that we cannot wait for the Fiori report, which will not be discussed until the October II part-session.
What Mr Rothley says is also incorrect. We are indeed a legislative body, but his own Minister of Justice in Germany, Ms Däubler-Gmelin, once applied this procedure.
Even the Federal Government once appealed against a patent which had been awarded by the Patent Office in 1999.
Mr President, I will not go into the content again; I would just like to correct a statement which was made in error.
I spoke for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and what I said applies to our group.
I just wanted to clarify that point.
The problem raised by the patents granted by the European Patent Office to Myriad Genetics does not appear to derive from the field of ethics.
These patents highlight a technical question deriving from the field of patent law.
The situation is thus completely different from that raised by the famous "Edinburgh patent".
The problem resides more in the extent of the protection to be granted to these patents.
This question is highly complex since, as it applies to gene sequences, it undoubtedly involves a situation relating to competition and innovation, and in no way fundamental principles relating to the dignity or integrity of human beings.
It should be noted that this patent is of undoubted interest for the scientific community.
It should make it possible to improve the early detection of breast cancer in women.
The Commission considers there are no imperative reasons why the Commission should raise any objections, as the contested patent does not infringe essential ethical rules and concerns the field of application which can be granted to a patent relating to a DNA sequence.
Nevertheless, the Commission will study the question of the field of protection for inventions relating to gene sequences in depth and will communicate its observations to the Council and Parliament in the reports provided for by Directive 98/44.
I am utterly amazed that the Commission is not responding. Number one.
Secondly, I would ask the Commission whether it is in fact willing to do anything before 10 October.
When I say a gene, I mean a gene sequence.
According to the patent directive, a gene sequence cannot be patented.
Mr President, I vigorously endorse what Ms Oomen-Ruijten has said.
Commissioner, you cannot take an infinite amount of time over this.
I too expect that the Commission will state its position on this issue by 9 October.
You said that there are no objections of an ethical nature, but that you will study the question of the field of protection for inventions.
However, you have not answered the question put to you by myself, Mr Blokland, and others on whether Article 5.1 now applies in this context or whether Article 5.2 should take priority.
I believe that many Members of this House expect the Commission to clarify this serious and very important issue.
Thank you very much, Mrs Breyer.
I would ask you to exercise a little discipline, because otherwise we will never finish this debate and we still have the voting time at 6.30 p.m. and two further reports to get through.
Mr President, naturally, I am referring to the procedure.
I would like to thank the Commission for the explanation.
I fully endorse its position.
Please be assured that the Commission has the support of a large majority of Members of this House.
Mr President, this is a very serious matter.
I call upon the Commission to study very carefully whether these patents which have been awarded genuinely comply with the Patent Directive, and not to act as if this House had no role in this area and were not entitled to adopt decisions.
I hope that you will take serious steps to comply with the decisions which are about to be adopted by this House.
I will put your objections to my colleagues.
I also want to point out that what I have said reflects the way the Commission services, and the Commission as such, analyse this issue.
I will repeat what I just said: "the Commission considers there are no imperative reasons why it should raise any objections, as the contested patent does not infringe essential ethical rules and concerns the field of application which can be granted to a patent relating to a DNA sequence".
Obviously there is, and may continue to be, disagreement.
This is the reality in an area like this, and ten years of discussions leading up to the 1998 directive may not be enough to create a real, workable agreement.
However, this is the legislation we have as our basis for action.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, at 6.00 p.m.
Community guarantee for EIB loans to former Yugoslavia
The next item is the report (A5-0300/2001) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 2000/24/EC so as to extend the Community guarantee granted to the European Investment Bank to cover loans for projects in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [COM(2001) 356 - C5-0335/2001 - 2001/0143(CNS)].
Mr President, the European Union has a cheap way of helping other countries: it guarantees credit granted by the European Investment Bank to these other countries.
In practice such aid has not cost the EU anything in recent years.
The recipients of loans have benefited from the guarantees as they have been granted loans at interest rates which are easier to bear than those that are granted on the basis of the much tougher market conditions.
This cheap and effective method of assistance is regulated in the EU and there is a maximum amount for guaranteed loans, which is divided into regional envelopes.
The Commission proposal now being discussed is to increase the envelope for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, out of which the EIB can grant loans of up to EUR 8 930 million covered by an EU guarantee.
In order to be able to provide financial support for the reconstruction of former Yugoslavia, it is desirable that that country be included among the recipients of loan guarantees. With that purpose in mind, it is being proposed that the Central and Eastern Europe loan envelope be increased by EUR 350 million.
This amount is not being earmarked for former Yugoslavia' s use alone, but, after the increase, it will be able to receive loans out of this envelope of loans if it can show the EIB valid projects for its use.
It is being proposed to grant loans to former Yugoslavia covered by a 65% guarantee.
That is the condition of the guarantee generally in use and the EU has incurred no liability in respect of guarantees in recent years for loans granted in accordance with this condition.
For the increase in the Yugoslavian envelope to take place there will have to be a transfer of funds from the EU budget reserves to the Guarantee Fund, although the increase in the envelope cannot be implemented in full during the current year.
So the transfers will also have to be made over the next two years as former Yugoslavia finds suitable construction projects.
In my capacity as permanent rapporteur for these matters I would, in this connection, like to express my concern that next year the Guarantee Fund will have no margin whatsoever for new and unexpected aid actions.
Next year will be extremely problematic in that sense and the Commission must focus its attention on the problem of the overuse of the Guarantee Fund accordingly.
The situation is further worsened by the Commission' s proposal for deliberation by Parliament regarding loans granted to Russia by the EIB in respect of environmental protection investments in the Baltic Sea basin.
Quite incomprehensibly, the Council has demanded that a 100% guarantee be granted to cover these loans, in place of the normal 65%.
The Council' s decision shows that there are Member States that want to hamper environmental cooperation with Russia.
The way in which some Member States are acting in this connection is a display of ignorance of how the system works.
Russia will indeed get its loan, but another country will not, as a 100% guarantee needlessly eats into the margin in the Guarantee Fund set aside for others.
Increasing the envelope for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe for the needs of reconstruction in Yugoslavia is justified and there is no need to table amendments to the Commission' s proposal.
I would like to express my appreciation to Parliament for the timely preparation of its opinion on this proposal.
This proposal is an integral element of the European Union's support to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
It aims to assist the country's political and economic reform programme.
I am glad to note that the rapporteur fully agrees with this view.
The proposal enables the EIB to finance, under Community guarantee, basic investments in the transport and energy sectors, investments much needed to rehabilitate infrastructure damaged by the recent conflicts and by lack of maintenance in the past decade.
The proposed increase of the lending mandate and the CEEC envelope by EUR 350 m is in line with the foreseen amount of EIB lending to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
The final amount of loans to the country will depend on its absorption potential and on the availability of suitable projects, and could exceed EUR 350 m.
I say this in response to the rapporteur's warning about the risk of the overuse of funds.
The possibility of hitting or moving the ceiling is there, but it very much depends on the emergence of suitable projects.
I can confirm that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has agreed to assume responsibility for its share of the outstanding financial obligations of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
We have been informed that an agreement between the EIB and the FRY to that effect was approved by the Yugoslavian Parliament last week.
With the entry into force of that decision - foreseen at the end of this week - I am glad to say that a remaining obstacle to the proposal will be removed.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, at 6.30 p.m.
Association of overseas countries and territories with the EC
The next item is the report (A5-0276/2001) by Mr Fruteau, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council decision on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Community ( 'Overseas' ) ( [COM(2000) 732 - C5-0070/2001 - 2001/2033(COS)].

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when I was elected to the European Parliament, it was with a clear mandate, not only to represent Réunion, the island where I come from, or even the outermost regions, but also to try to make the voice of all of the French overseas territories heard.
This is why I am glad that Parliament charged me with being its spokesperson on the statute of association between the overseas countries and territories, the OCTs, and the European Union.
I would also like to commend the spirit of openness that prevailed when this report was being drawn up.
Allow me first to venture a historical and political look at the relations that some Member States have had with their former colonies, relations that have been marked, in my opinion, by the bond of exclusivity and by supervision, which are pillars of the colonial pact.
We should now break with the past and with the feeling of guilt that goes with it, in order to define a true responsible and equal partnership between the overseas countries and territories, the attached Member States and the European Union.
This is the path that we should resolutely take, in order for this new decision of association to be the real qualitative leap expected by all of the overseas countries and territories.
This challenge is, however, made difficult by the lack of homogeneity among the OCTs and by the structural handicaps that are physically curbing their development: about twenty countries linked with four Member States - The United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark and France -, mostly small and island countries, with the notable exception of Greenland, very remote from the European continent, characterised by an extreme economic and social diversity (the richest are within the Community average, while the poorest are really under-developed), and also by diversity of status in terms of the relations that the overseas countries and territories have forged during their history with their mainland, relations characterised by considerable independence for some and major State supervision for others.
It has to be said that the Commission' s proposal, as it has been put forward, only partly responds to this challenge and to the legitimate aspirations of these territories found in all four corners of the globe. There are still acute questions in terms of the institutional, economic, financial and commercial problems.
First of all from an institutional point of view, I would like to welcome the establishment of a forum to facilitate partnership between the OCTs, the Member States and the Commission, although it is regrettable that decision making is not more in the hands of the leaders of the overseas countries and territories.
Next, from an economic and financial point of view, the Commission has indeed retained a differentiated strategy, taking into account the extreme diversity among the overseas countries and territories, but I deplore the fact that the amount of aid is essentially fixed based on GNP per inhabitant.
I think it would have been more appropriate to add demographic and social criteria to this, which are a fairer reflection of the vulnerability of these territories.
I will take this opportunity to call again for the creation of a specific development fund for the overseas countries and territories, separate from the European development fund, which I am convinced would be more in keeping with the spirit and the letter of the association.
Finally, from a commercial point of view, I must stress here that the share of overseas countries and territories in trade with the Community is very low, which makes it difficult to understand the Commission' s defensive position.
It is true that it is essential that in certain cases, such as that of sugar, it should be extremely vigilant in order to prevent the original rules, which are necessary for the development of all of the overseas countries and territories, from being abused, with the effect of destabilising some European markets, particularly in outermost regions.
However, not only out of a concern for coherence, at a time when the Union is completely opening up its markets to the least advanced countries, but also in view of the common history of the OCTs and the European Union, we do not understand why it is refusing them what it is granting to the least advanced countries.
Community solidarity cannot be two-speed.
It is thus high time that we showed effectively that the overseas countries and territories are not the poor relations of our development policy.
In other words, it is high time that we proved tangibly to these people that they are right in believing in the European Union.
This is why, to finish, I wish to reiterate the desire that I state several times in my report, that the tenth anniversary of the statute of association should be an opportunity for reaffirming the strong political will towards these territories, that have for too long been left to be blown by the wind, across all the oceans of the world, in order to firmly and resolutely undertake the path of partnership and responsibility, in other words the path of development for all.
Mr President, I would firstly like to state that I am speaking on behalf of my Mr Fernández Martín, who is not able to attend.
I would like to make clear that among the wide range of regional associations or groups of countries with which the European Union maintains relations, the group of overseas countries and territories, the PTOMs to use the French term, is certainly the most heterogeneous of all.
In actual fact, they are grouped together more for what they are not than for what they are.
Hence the special merit offered, in my opinion, by the proposed Council Decision and the report which Mr Fruteau has produced in relation to it.
Generally speaking, I agree with the rapporteur' s proposals, although I would certainly express some of them somewhat differently.
However, I would like to announce that my group will vote in favour of them.
The rapporteur proposes a series of measures which attempt to strengthen the association system which has linked the PTOMs to the Union since 1991, by stating that on this tenth anniversary of the said agreement, the Union should be more ambitious with regard to the most distant territories of the continent.
I must point out that the PTOMs as a whole, and each one of them in particular, do not form part of the territory of the Union.
Their inhabitants have European citizenship (French, British, Dutch or Danish, as the case may be) but the territories in which they live do not form part of the European Union itself - in the case of Greenland, for example, its citizens voted in a referendum to leave what we then called the European Communities; in the case of New Caledonia, in accordance with a plan drawn up with the French authorities, they have also begun a procedure which will lead them, in a few years' time, to join the group of ACP countries.
And I could cite in this way further examples of specific cases, almost as many as there are PTOM countries and territories.
This heterogeneity is evident in many other respects and the most noteworthy of these is their sparse and irregularly distributed population.
As the rapporteur rightly stresses, the population of the twenty overseas territories hardly exceeds one million inhabitants and three of them, the Dutch Antilles, French Polynesia and New Caledonia, have more than 150 000 inhabitants each, so these three territories alone account for almost half of the total population.
Therefore, when almost three years ago we discussed the report produced at the time by our colleague Blaise Aldo, we wanted to place special emphasis on the development of the PTOMs' trade relations with the ACP countries close to them and in some cases, such as that of the Caribbean, with equally close outermost regions.
However, INTERREG did not meet the expectations raised as a basis for developing these trading relations.
Perhaps this could be attempted again now with INTERREG III, and I agree with the rapporteur that the development of the PTOMs should be promoted through a specific fund to simplify the procedures for linking it to the EDF or to Cotonou - although I know that the Commission has its own opinion in this respect.
In conclusion, I request an oral amendment which I hope can be accepted.
In the first paragraph of the explanatory statement the rapporteur expressly mentions the seven outermost regions of the European Union, stating that they opted for full integration into the respective Member States, former colonial powers.
That is not correct.
The Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands did not have any colonial status at any time in their history, which is why they should be expressly excluded from this statement by the rapporteur, and I hope that the House and the rapporteur himself can accept this request.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to express my great satisfaction at being able to speak for the first time in this House on the issue of the Overseas Countries and Territories.
These twenty territories benefit from a particular association arrangement with the European Union, which, when described in simple terms, is less favourable than the status reserved for the outermost regions, which are integral parts of the Union, but more advantageous than the agreements made with third countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.
As a French overseas member of this Parliament my attention is naturally drawn to the fate of the French territories and administrative authorities concerned, which are, and I am pleased to list them here, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, the French Southern and Antarctic Territories, Wallis and Futuna, Mayotte and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon.
In his excellent report, Mr Fruteau welcomes the progress in relations between the European Union and the OCTs from an institutional, economic and financial point of view, even though there remain many questions on the Commission' s proposals having to respond to the objectives included in declaration 36 with regard to the OCTs annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam.
With regard to trade relations, the rapporteur emphasises the low level of trade with the Union.
In 1998, imports from OCTs amounted to 0.21 % of Community imports, with exports to OCTs amounting to 0.43 % of Community exports as a whole.
A liberalisation of trade with OCTs could fulfil the objectives we have set ourselves.
We should be particularly careful, however, that this liberalisation does not result in some kind of diversion from our current objectives.
For several years, imports have been increasing from a particular OCT (which happens to be Aruba but this is not the time to hold it up as an example), which runs counter to the spirit of this association agreement with the European Union.
These products exported to the Union do not come from the OCT, but are imported there from ACP countries for minor processing such as the whitening of rice, sifting, packaging or mixing.
These simple operations only require very low levels of investment, and are therefore in no way a development factor as the Court of Justice in Luxembourg highlighted in its ruling on the "Emesa sugar" case in 1998, as the only interest is providing easy added value for international operators.
The increase in this type of inefficiency is all the more intolerable given that it goes against the interests of the other OCTs, the outermost regions and the ACP countries.
In this context, without questioning the objectives proposed by the rapporteur, which I willingly support, it is essential that we establish strict original rules to prevent these breaches , which are detrimental to the economies of all overseas territories.
In this respect, the measures for prohibiting cumulation of origin for certain products, increasing the list of inadequate processes or the systematic implementation of safeguard clauses in no way provide a suitable response to this problem.
I wish to begin by saying that I totally support Mrs Sudre's remarks.
The Commission is always asked to ensure that there is coherence in what we do and we have a strong case of lack of coherence when we look at the trade practices that are at the heart of this debate.
We have had good reason to do what we have done and I definitely hope that some constructive conclusion that ends this traffic will be part of the final solution for the whole matter.
Let me also congratulate the Committee on Development and Cooperation and the rapporteur for a clear and generally balanced analysis of this whole matter, although I need to make some remarks.
The Commission proposal is based on the widest consultation of the parties concerned ever made in this field.
Thus, it is not surprising that some of the indications we have received as part of this wide consultation process point in different, even conflicting, directions.
Inevitably, some delicate compromises have had to be struck, for example in the trade sector.
However, we have kept to the objective of giving an adequate and ambitious response to the expectations of the OCTs and to the challenges facing them.
The motion before you today gives a positive assessment of several innovations we have proposed, such as the reinforced partnership procedure, the simplified financial regulations and the new role of civil society.
In my view, other points also deserve to be mentioned, for example the extension of many budget lines, Community programmes and provisions on trade in services to the OCTs.
There is a tendency to neglect the importance, the scope and the opportunities for the OCTs to be able to access as users Community programmes in general.
This is new and should be highlighted.
I have remarks to make concerning two chapters of the proposal - financial aid and trade.
As to the European Development Fund, it is correct that, in respect of the past, financial aid will no longer be given to three OCTs - Aruba, the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands - because their GNP is now near or even higher than in the Community.
It is important that all Members of Parliament are made aware of this.
We have to get out of the habit of having OCT issues being discussed only in the few Member States that have a direct part in the discussion.
In the past, it has looked a little too much like a self-service shop.
We are talking about Community matters and they should be discussed at that level.
For all the other OCTs, in the future funds will be granted following more objective, transparent and coherent criteria.
Income, GNP, has to be one of them, along with population, as we want to ensure that the taxpayers' money is spent where it is most needed, and this means in the fight against poverty.
This is the cornerstone of the EU development policy, and I want to stick to this - also in respect of the clear support for this development policy in this House.
Transitional provisions have been proposed.
Substantial funds are reserved for social and environmental projects in medium income OCTs.
Secondly, money has to go where it is best used.
This is why we have proposed to keep a reserve not only to cover emergency aid and the kinds of activities that cannot be programmed in advance, but also to grant additional transfers to those territories which use their initial amounts more efficiently.
A real part of the story is that quite an impressive amount of money has not been well utilised.
So this performance criterion is a necessary component and the reason we want to keep a reserve to solve this problem.
The Commission is looking into absorption problems but I have the impression that more efforts should be made by the OCTs themselves to use funds efficiently.
I regret - but I have to tell you - that certain Member States do not seem to share these priorities.
Again this is a matter for the Community.
We have to get out of the self-service syndrome.
The reduction in Regional Funds is justified by the limited use made of them in the past.
Should this situation change, I would be very pleased to reconsider this point.
The Commission also wants to send a strong message to those OCTs defined as tax havens in the OECD analysis.
Unless and until they redress their practices, their allocations will and should be cut back.
Again let me remind Parliament of the strong emphasis placed on the need for coherence.
Parliament's views on this matter have been made very clear to us.
We happen to agree with them but we cannot say one thing in one document and then not apply it in an area like this.
I share the view that different ways of financing OCT aid than the EDF could be considered.
However, in practice this would only be possible when new budget guidelines are agreed in a few years' time.
For the same reason, given the existing budgetary rules, the EDF is currently the only real possibility for financing partnership meetings and evaluation studies.
But let me repeat that opening access to active involvement in Community programmes is an interesting additional way for the OCTs to benefit from our relationship.
Let me turn to trade.
For too many years now this has been a bone of contention between some OCTs and the Community.
Unfortunately, excessive expectations in this field have been generated despite our advice.
When the Community has been forced to take corrective measures those expectations have inevitably been disappointed.
But part of the problem and the cases that have dominated this discussion were also the product of deliberate engineering of ways in which to use or misuse the existing system.
We should not fool ourselves on this issue.
So let me be very clear here. The Commission has always supported a liberal trade attitude toward our preferential partners, in particular developing countries.
The recent initiative on "Everything But Arms" is just one latest example.
The OCTs will continue to enjoy the most favourable trade arrangement granted by the Community.
This is the current position and so it will remain.
However, a line has to be drawn between supporting economic activities and tolerating purely speculative operations which have no development effects and, in addition, cost huge sums to the Community, be it the Community budget, consumers or productive sectors.
In other cases, real abuses have been identified and stopped by our anti-fraud departments.
It is only reasonable that when preparing new legislation we seek to eliminate the risk of this happening again.
Once more, such misuse has not served in any way the best interests of OCT citizens and governments.
Let me stress that the OCT association certainly includes the principle of preferential access to our market, but not an unconditional one.
This is not only the view of the Commission, as the Council and the Court of Justice have consistently endorsed it.
Coherence with the other Treaty policies and with the rule of the law must also be maintained.
It is in the urgent interest of the OCTs that a favourable business climate is re-established as soon as possible.
This has to be our main objective when formulating our proposals on trade.
Finally, let me express the hope that very soon we can reach the end of this long phase of transition and uncertainty concerning the future regime.
The Commission will, to this end, be available as a catalyst where needed to achieve a rapid conclusion in the Council to end the long saga of this renewal of the OCT regime.
I definitely hope that Parliament is giving a helping hand by this work of the rapporteur.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, at 6.30 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 6.05 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m.)
Mr President, we have heard on the news that a Russian commercial airliner has crashed into the Black Sea.
It is not clear whether it was an explosion or whether the aeroplane was accidentally shot down by the Ukrainian army.
I think that before the start of this vote - regardless of what caused this tragic accident - we should briefly remember those who have lost their lives in this tragedy.
If you would be so kind, ladies and gentlemen, we will now observe a minute' s silence for the victims.
(Parliament observed a minute' s silence while remaining standing)
VOTE
Mr President, I simply wanted to inform you that we will abstain on paragraphs 5 and 6, as my group believes that since we are anticipating a legislative proposal within a matter of days, we should not make any statements prematurely.
Please understand that we will thus abstain on paragraphs 5 and 6.
Report (A5-0300/2001) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 2000/24/EC so as to extend the Community guarantee granted to the European Investment Bank to cover loans for projects in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (COM(2001) 356 - C5-0335/2001 - 2001/0143(CNS))
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0276/2001) by Mr Fruteau, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council decision on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Community ("Overseas") (COM(2000) 732 - C5-0070/2001 - 2001/2033(COS))
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 6.45 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 4 October 2001.
Announcement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, as you will recall, on 8 October, 104 passengers and four employees of Linate airport were killed in a tragic accident involving a small private aircraft and an SAS aeroplane, which was due to fly from Milan to Copenhagen.
Immediately after the disaster, I sent a message expressing my condolences to the President of the Italian Council and to the Danish Prime Minister.
Since I was on an official visit to Denmark the day after the accident occurred, I also gave the same message in person to the various authorities that I met during my visit.
I would, however, like to publicly demonstrate, once again, our solidarity and deep sympathy for the families of the victims.
Agenda
The next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents, pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.
Relating to Tuesday President.
I would like to inform you we shall have the election of a vice-president to replace Mr Wiebenga.
The election will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
I would reiterate that the deadline for nominations is 6 p.m. this evening.
Pursuant to Rule 62(5) of the Rules of Procedure, 95 Members have opposed the application of the procedure to delegate the power of decision to a committee for the Corbey report on packaging and packaging waste, currently scheduled to be taken at voting time on Tuesday at 12 noon.
This report will therefore be placed on the agenda of the next part-session in accordance with the normal procedure.
Madam President, I am rapporteur for the subject of Macedonia which is on tomorrow' s agenda.
However, the Commission has just informed us that this subject should be withdrawn.
As rapporteur, and also on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I propose that, in accordance with Article 144 of the Rules of Procedure, we delete this subject from tomorrow' s agenda.
The reason for this is that we have obtained information to the effect that the Commission wishes firstly to contribute more money by way of aid to Macedonia and secondly to extend the period of aid.
I therefore propose that we withdraw the subject from this part-session and instead address it in the November part-session.
We therefore refer the subject back to the Committee on Budgets and to the committees which are to issue opinions on this subject, that is to say the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
Of course, Mr Färm, I can confirm these details.
The Commission is currently preparing a revised proposal in order to take into account the additional requirements for financial resources requested by the International Monetary Fund.
Are there any objections to the proposal that Mr Färm has just made, who also supports the Commission proposal?
(Parliament gave its assent)
President.
Pursuant to Rule 114, 37 Members have opposed the application of the procedure without report to the proposal for a Council decision on admitting the European Community to the Codex Alimentarius Committee, currently scheduled to be taken at voting time on Tuesday at 12 noon.
This proposal for a decision is therefore referred back to the committee responsible for reconsideration.
The order of business is thus established.
Madam President, there is an urgent matter missing from the agenda to which I would briefly like to draw the attention of the Presidency and the Members.
The German foundation 'Memory, Responsibility and Future' , established by the German government and national enterprises, has taken the surprising, disturbing decision not to count Italian prisoners of war or even a large percentage of Italian civilian forced labourers among the former forced labourers in Germany, providing compensation only for civilians who were interned in actual concentration camps.
This exclusion is unjustified from a legal point of view and would hinder the deep reconciliation between the European peoples who were divided by the tragic experiences of the Second World War.
I feel that action needs to be taken to prevent this great discrimination in the German compensation against Italian prisoners of war and Italian civilian forced labourers.
Thank you, Mr Borghezio.
We shall of course take note of what you have said.
Madam President, this morning, when I got up, I found that I had lost my voice.
I have lost my voice and so I do not know whether I will be able to deliver my usual explanations of vote tomorrow.
That aside, I am here beside my friend, Mr Borghezio, not because I have changed group but because I support his proposal regarding the failure to provide compensation for Italian former prisoners of war and Italian civilian forced labourers.
These are all people who are over 75 years of age, and therefore pensioners, who have been left by the Italian government without a pension.
Therefore, the damages suffered by these Italian citizens, who, like many of us, have suffered the outrages of war, are even greater because, in addition to not receiving this compensation, they are pensioners who do not receive a pension.
Madam President, given the degree to which the media has had access to an unpublished report commissioned by the EU's Scientific and Technological Option Assessment Committee, STOA, entitled "The Possible Toxic Effects from Nuclear Reprocessing Plants at Sellafield and Cap de la Hague", could you immediately organise for the publication of this report to ensure a balanced and informed comment by all, especially by us in this Parliament of democratically elected representatives?
I am strongly of the view that all reports by committees of this House, whatever their status, should at least be available to Members of this House before they are available to those outside.
Please arrange for that report's immediate publication.
Mrs Doyle, I shall give your request my full consideration.
Madam President, as president of STOA, may I point out that the study to which the honourable Mr Doyle refers has not yet been officially adopted by STOA's plenary.
It is on the agenda for the next meeting here in Strasbourg.
As you know, this study examined numerous aspects and independent experts were also asked for their opinion, because we want to ensure that the study is reliable and that STOA is reliable.
Once STOA's plenary has reached a decision, we shall pass it on so that we can take what I imagine will be the right decision on such an important matter.
Madam President, in the absence of our chairman, as vice-chairman of the Committee on Petitions I would point out that our committee requested the report from STOA on the possible toxic effects of Sellafield in the Irish Sea and Cap de la Hague in the English Channel.
The Petitions Committee is as anxious as anybody that this report should be published as soon as possible.
It is important that the report, when adopted by STOA, is seen to be absolutely objective and scientifically independent.
That is why it has been subjected to independent assessment.
When we have considered that assessment I believe all Members of this House would want the report to be published.
But that should not be done whilst doubts remain - and unfortunately there are doubts - about the objectivity of the report as currently presented to the STOA panel.
Madam President, I was astonished to read in the press the outcome of the negotiations by the Conference of Presidents to decide the winner of the Sakharov Prize.
What I am asking myself is where and when will MEPs be given an opportunity to begin to understand how the presidents, or the majority of presidents, or whoever, came to a decision which patently contradicts the MEPs who voted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
I find this scandalous to say the least, and I believe that there is a genuine problem with the way things work in our Parliament, which is that, in actual fact, we serve no purpose.
We spend hours having debates and casting votes in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and then afterwards, Mr Poettering calls Mr Barón Crespo or Mr Barón Crespo calls Mr Poettering and what we think counts for nothing.
I would simply like to say that we are Members who were elected with the same votes as Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo, and that I cannot accept that it is they who call the shots in the European Parliament, therefore I want us to discuss, in plenary, the way that decisions are taken, just as the Sakharov Prize was discussed last week.
(Applause from the Greens/ALE Group)
Madam President, as Mr Cohn-Bendit has referred to me, I will gladly respond in this House to what he has said.
The Conference of Presidents confirmed the majority vote of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and also proposed the runner-up, who had also received a large number of votes, so that there are three nominations.
I would also like to tell you, Mr Cohn-Bendit, that you can not only reach me at any time by telephone, but I am also available for private discussions whenever you wish.
Madam President, I spoke to Mr Wurtz on the telephone and to Mrs Hautala and Mr Lannoye in person.
First of all, I do not consider the fact that Members of this Parliament should talk to one another as a crime and secondly, the Conference of Presidents has respected the proposal tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy.
The proof of this is that the prize was awarded to the joint Israeli-Palestinian proposal and to the proposal from the bishop of Angola by a very large majority.
Furthermore, on your own initiative, Madam President, a special mention will be given to Mrs Sedrine, the Tunisian journalist.
I would ask my fellow Members, especially Mr Cohn-Bendit, to be a bit more careful about what they say because, apart from the fact that the decision of the Committee on Foreign Affairs has been respected, the last thing we need at such a sensitive political moment is to create a religious war between a Christian, a Muslim and a Jew.
This is completely unacceptable.
Madam President, I had the opportunity to express my views on this matter before the Conference of Presidents meeting.
I do not feel that now is the time to argue about this, or to have a dispute over procedure.
In my view, I am extremely pleased that the Conference of Presidents had virtually unanimously agreed to award the Sakharov Prize to Mr Ghazzawi and to Mrs Peled-Elhanan, who, to my mind, symbolise what many of us aspire to, in other words, to give hope to those who wish to find the path of dialogue and peace in the Middle East, a region that has been so afflicted.
From this point of view, Madam President, I think that, and the European Council also gave this message, in other words, that we request Ariel Sharon' s government to respect international law and withdraw his tanks and troops as a matter of urgency from the autonomous Palestinian territories, I think that it would certainly be in the spirit of the Sakharov Prize for you, Madam President, if you agree, to give this message to the Israeli government on our behalf.
Thank you, Madam President.
Mr Wurtz, I think that, given the applause that I have just heard, I am certainly able to do this.
I have one comment to make, Mr Barón Crespo: when the prize is given to two people - one a Muslim, the other Jewish - this means that a war of religions does not exist. If you are brave, you are not obliged to add that we need a Catholic as well, as there is still no war of religions.
You say, therefore, that the decision was not to award the prize to two Muslims, but to a Jew and a Muslim.
That is all you need to say and that is why I maintain that a lack of courage and historical insight are what led to the proposal by the Committee on Foreign Affairs being watered down.
Madam President, Africa also exists.
We attended the Durban Conference and we must also send a message of hope for the ongoing conflicts in Africa.
Furthermore, I am delighted with the unanimity that this prize has inspired and I give it my support, which is no less than you deserve.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago, another five workers lost their lives as the result of an explosion on the tanker which they were repairing in Salamina.
This is the umpteenth time that workers in my country have paid with their blood for the lack of rudimentary safety measures as the result of the unaccountability of shipowners and the privatisation of control services, which issue certificates based on the shipowners' interests rather than on respect for the workers' lives.
The Greek government is also to blame for failing to take any action whatsoever, despite the large number of accidents.
I should like to use this tribune to express our condolences to the victims' families and to roundly condemn the unaccountability of their employers and the policy of the Greek government.
Be it in Toulouse or Salamina, the working classes are being sacrificed for the sake of a competitive economy and more and more profit.
Madam President, I do not know if you remember, but, a couple of months ago, I severely criticised the fact that we Danes were being treated unfairly.
We did not have the opportunity to watch Danish television.
I asked you and Mrs Banotti to look into the matter, and I should like to say that Mrs Banotti has again shown that she is good at these matters.
The Danes among us have now got Danish television again.
We are over the moon and, as Mrs Banotti can see, I am celebrating the fact in my national colours - a red jacket and a splendid white shirt from the Håndværker Bank in Næstved.
So you can see that we are really happy to have got Danish television.
Madam President, I would like to put on record my disappointment that we will not be able this week to discuss the money-laundering directive.
Thanks to the hard work of the Conciliation Committee and those in this House who have been working on this directive, we are on the point of an agreement with the European Council, and it is a pity that we were not able to get it on the agenda for this week.
This directive is as important in the fight against terrorism as the bombs which are being dropped on Afghanistan or the efforts of those who are risking their lives there.
It is something that we should deal with as promptly as possible, because starving the terrorist of his funds is just as important as subjecting him to military attack.
I hope this House will act swiftly when this matter comes before it at the next plenary session.
I am sorry that it was not possible to get it on the agenda for this month.
Madam President, I was not aware that this was going to arise and I apologise therefore to Mrs Villiers for not being able to talk to her about it earlier.
She is quite right to say that agreement has been reached with the Council and it is now up to Parliament to have the third reading.
We pressed extremely hard - and you, Madam President, were involved in this - to try and get to a position where we could be flexible and act very rapidly as a parliament.
Unfortunately, we have to await the documentation that comes from the Council in all 11 languages of the Community before we actually have Council's position formally adopted so that we can come to a conclusion with a third reading.
It is therefore, unfortunately, a matter of timing, due to the scheduling of documents and translation etc. that we do not have that flexibility.
I did press very hard indeed but unfortunately it was not achievable.
Madam President, my group would also have liked to see the money laundering directive approved sooner.
We would, indeed, have liked to have seen it wrapped up before the summer holidays.
But it was Mrs Villiers' own group which held out against an obligation on lawyers to report suspicious transactions and therefore held up the final resolution of this matter for six months after our plenary vote in April.
I am glad to say that the results of conciliation do not reflect that refusal and lawyers will have to contact the authorities when they have reason to believe their clients may be seeking advice in order to engage in money laundering.
I am glad that is the final result.
I deeply regret that it took so long.
I am afraid it is Mrs Villiers's own group - indeed her own delegation within that group - which contributed to that lengthened and regrettable delay.
Madam President, I would like to raise briefly a matter of serious concern to me, and perhaps to others in this House, relating to the question of discrimination.
This House rightly rejects discrimination in all its forms and we receive opinions on this subject from many quarters, including the Economic and Social Committee.
It now appears that this committee itself practises discrimination on the grounds of age, in that it is impossible to apply for a job there unless you are younger than 45.
Madam President, may I suggest that you write to them as a matter of urgency to see whether this is true and, if it is, perhaps to threaten that we will stop receiving their opinions until they abandon such discrimination.
Surely it should be possible for people to work for any institution at any age, even if they are as old as I am!
Thank you.
We shall look into this, as you have asked.
Madam President, I should like to raise an issue which I raised at the previous part-session, that is, the predicament of national airlines in Europe which are currently facing effective annihilation.
It is reckoned that approximately EUR 2.5 billion will be lost by the European aviation industry between now and the end of the year, and that some 20 000 jobs will be lost.
The Commission response to this, however, has been stony-faced and ideological.
It has sought to use the crisis arising from the atrocities of 11 September to shake out the industry to ensure that companies that may or may not have survived in the normal course of economic operations are forced to close down.
I would appeal to the Commission to use some political sagacity in its approach to this situation.
If the European project does not have the support of the people of Europe it will not succeed, and the Commission is failing to recognise this.
Every single job lost in the European aviation industry as a result of the Commission's decision, will create an ever-widening pool of resentment towards Europe, not towards national governments which may be pursuing their own agendas.
The Commission must urgently review its approach to the aviation industry.
Madam President, this is the second session that we are holding in October.
As you will recall, at our first October session, we made a last minute change to the agenda in order to debate and vote on the dreadful accident that occurred at the AZF factory in Toulouse.
Yet, two days ago, this very factory released several tonnes of ammonia into the Garonne river, which flows through the city of Toulouse.
I am therefore asking you, Madam President, to ensure that the resolution we adopted is followed up by the Commission, to prevent it becoming lost in a mass of administrative red tape.
I believe that the impunity and the arrogance of the polluters must be met with the determination of our Parliament.
I shall gladly do so, Mr Onesta.
Madam President, I would like to present a communiqué concerning our colleague Patricia McKenna.
She took part today in a peaceful demonstration at the nuclear weapons base at Faslane, Scotland, and was arrested at eight in the morning along with twelve Irish students.
She asks you to give your attention to the fact that a Member of the European Parliament may not be arrested when he or she is on the way to or from meetings of the European Parliament.
She also hopes that this request will bring about a debate concerning the unlawfulness of nuclear weapons.
Quite recently, the International Court of Justice has stated that the possession of weapons of mass destruction contravenes international law.
Madam President, I am aware that some here will find themselves thinking that it is not possible to travel to Strasbourg via Scotland; but I would merely like to say - in Patricia McKenna's native language - that "what goes up, must come down".
Mrs Hautala, I have just received some information regarding Mrs McKenna, and I shall of course see what we can do to help her.
Madam President, I would like to thank you for mentioning at the start of the sitting the tragedy which took place at Milan Linate airport, which claimed 118 lives.
Investigations are currently being carried out into who is responsible.
Of course, it became clear very early on that, while, regrettably, human error is always possible, it was made possible in this case largely by the severe lack of security in that airport, which we all believed to be safe.
From the human point of view, I feel that it is becoming imperative that these errors are not repeated and that such a tragic incident should compel all those responsible to undertake solemnly to ensure that such tragedies are avoided in the future.
As regards responsibility, I feel that we, as the European Union, should call upon the Commission and the Council to be more rigorous in enforcing the imperative need for airport security, to ensure that such tragedies are avoided in future.
Mrs Ghilardotti, I believe that what you have said somewhat pre-empts the debate that will take place in a few moments, following the points of order.
Madam President, unfortunately the fears which I expressed the very day after the terrorist attack in the USA have come true and the death of the thousands of innocent American victims is being used as an excuse for a barbaric attack on Afghanistan, giving rise to new hordes of innocent victims and causing tremendous damage.
Today, 15 days after the attacks started, it is clear - witness the announcements by the US administration - that the aim is not to stamp out terrorism, it is - or at least one of the aims is - to control central Asia and its huge natural resources and highly important geo-strategic position.
My fear, especially after Mrs Gandhi, that this attack will be used to further strengthen capitalist mechanisms and curtail our workers' and our nations' democratic freedoms and rights, has also come true.
The EU, led by the three, has aligned with the USA in what is a disastrous policy for our nations and our planet.
I believe that the European Parliament, as a democratically elected house, has a duty, if it wants to serve the peaceful, democratic visions and wishes of our people, to oppose these developments, to push for the EU to disassociate itself from them, to stop the war and to revert to resolving differences by peaceful means.
However, in the final analysis, it is up to the people.
Madam President, we are a small delegation of MEPs who have just come back from the Clinique Sainte Barbe here in Strasbourg, to which a former Chechen minister, Mr Ibragimov, had been admitted after having been on hunger strike for 27 days.
We went there to talk with Mr Ibragimov and to alert the world to the fact that this hunger strike took place here in Strasbourg.
Mr Ibragimov naturally drew attention to the fact that he wanted international organisations and politicians to try to convince President Putin to put an end to the war in Chechnya and to adhere to the agreements entered into between Chechnya and Russia, and I should like to convey this message of his.
Mr Ibragimov has begun to eat again.
He is still very weak, but human rights campaigners have encouraged him to abandon his hunger strike.
He will begin it again later, together with other human rights campaigners, if there is still no progress on Chechnya in the future.
However, I think it was important to visit him.
My point is that we must not forget that human rights are being violated.
Now that we are combating terrorism, we must not forget human rights, and I should like to call upon you to tell Mr Ibragimov that you are willing to meet him - if that is possible - during the next part-session in Strasbourg.
Consequences of recent events for the safety of air transport and industrial installations including nuclear power plants
The next item is the Commission statement on the consequences of recent events for the safety of air transport and industrial installations, including nuclear power plants.
I shall now give the floor to Commissioner Vitorino.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at the previous plenary session of the European Parliament, a debate was held on the steps to take in the fight against terrorism in the wake of the attacks of 11 September.
On behalf of my colleague, Mrs De Palacio, I would today like to discuss the consequences of these events for the safety of air transport, and also the implications that such events could have for some industrial installations, particularly nuclear power plants.
I shall therefore begin with the issue of air transport safety.
As I am sure you know, the European Council of 21 September 2001 requested that measures be taken in order to strengthen air transport security.
The Commission showed a dynamic approach and immediately reacted by formulating an appropriate Community response to the attacks carried out in the United States of America.
Without further delay - following a request made by the European Council - the Commission proposed that Member States put in place a 'dual review' mutual inspection system.
This reciprocal monitoring system will enable experts of one Member State to be sent to inspect security measures in airports of another Member State.
We must point out, however, that Member States are reluctant to give inspectors this task.
So far, only two Member States have submitted to the Commission proposals on the representatives that they wish to appoint.
On 10 October, the Commission proposed a draft regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council to approximate air transport security and safety standards within the European Union, and also to give the Commission the power of execution and inspection in order to ensure that the standards are being applied.
This text specifically mentions access control to sensitive areas of airports and aircraft, control of passengers and their hand luggage, control and monitoring of hold luggage, control of cargo and mail and, lastly, the training of ground staff.
Mrs De Palacio presented this proposal to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism the same day that it was adopted, and we hope that Parliament will be able to examine it as a matter of urgency in order to enable an agreement to be reached at the Council in December, with the hope that the co-decision procedure can take place at first reading.
In addition, an ad-hoc multidisciplinary group, made up of experts in air safety and combating terrorism, was set up immediately.
Unfortunately, the work of the group of experts has been inconclusive and the preliminary report submitted to the Transport Council on 16 October merely stresses, firstly, that much remains to be done in order to ensure that safety measures are being applied effectively in all airports and, secondly, identifies the need for new measures to prevent the dangerous behaviour of some individuals in aircraft, such as banning access to cockpits or enhancing cooperation between civil monitoring of air traffic and the use of military air defence methods.
We are convinced that we must make headway on the proposals that we have submitted to you. Not only because of a lack of specific recommendations from the above mentioned group, but also because international bodies appear to be having difficulties in reacting swiftly.
Therefore, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which held its assembly meeting in September, has limited itself to the single principle of organising a conference, the date of which has not yet been arranged.
We hope that, at the European Union' s initiative, the ICAO will take on the responsibility of ensuring the adoption of the recommendations that it received with a view to strengthening international safety standards that apply to airports and air transport.
Nevertheless, given the situation, the United States naturally decided to move forward themselves on this issue.
The Commission believes that we must enhance cooperation so that preventative measures are implemented in a coordinated manner on both sides of the Atlantic.
In this spirit, we organised a meeting with our American counterparts, which is to be held on 6 and 7 November 2001, to set up a working group that brings together the American authorities and the Commission with a view to coordinating efforts so that the highest possible level of security is ensured, whilst avoiding a situation where airline companies are subjected to excessive measures.
I shall now move on to the possible consequences of terrorist activities, such as those committed on 11 September 2001, had they been carried out on an industrial or power installation.
The nuclear industry is one of the sectors of industry that has the most stringent security and safety standards, particularly because of the requirements of non-proliferation and radiation protection.
We should also mention, however, that other installations, that are less well protected, may be vulnerable, and a fatal accident of considerable proportions could happen at one of these plants, whether they belong to the chemical industry, which was the case at Bhopal, Seveso and recently at Toulouse - or at other power installations, such as natural gas infrastructures, which are not without risks.
Some of us still recall the time when hydroelectric dams burst.
Since 11 September, Member States' authorities have strengthened existing protective systems and physical protection measures that were already in force for at-risk installations and more specifically for nuclear installations.
These physical protection measures are particularly for access control to the installations and include a ban on flying over the installations.
As far as the design of existing installations is concerned, it must be noted that the risks are taken into consideration, either wholly or according to the probability of an accident taking place.
Therefore, the risk of a primary cooling system bursting, to which terrorists could have access, is taken wholly into account and a security system is put in place to avoid this risk.
Comparative assessments are carried out on other risks.
This is what happens for seismic risks, which are taken into consideration in a number of ways, according to the geographical location of the installation itself.
In this respect, the Commission would like to reiterate that the design and construction of electro-nuclear power stations fall within the sole competence of Member States.
In addition to conventional nuclear installations, however, we must also take into account the risks related to transporting nuclear materials.
In reality, the transportation of highly radioactive materials is only a very small part of activities involving nuclear materials and is carried out in accordance with the most stringent provisions of international and national regulations.
As a general rule, to use nuclear materials for the purposes of terrorism, perpetrators require, beyond simply holding the nuclear materials, the technical capability to store, process and launch the materials, which would be very difficult to achieve without alerting the authorities.
Everything has been implemented at Community level, by applying Chapter VII of the Euratom Treaty, which requires a strict registration of nuclear materials in order to prevent them being used for non-peaceful purposes.
Nonetheless, the events in New York show that we must assess the vulnerability of nuclear installations.
The Commission services are carrying out an evaluation, in collaboration with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, particularly in terms of security at nuclear installations.
Our assessment should show how worthwhile it would be to publish the recommendations and to supplement existing legislation at Community and/or international level.
In particular, we must assess the conventions established under the International Atomic Energy Agency, such as the convention on physical protection, which mainly covers the transportation of nuclear materials.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your attention.
We on this side whole-heartedly support the response of the United States, the European Union and its Member States and other countries to the attacks of 11 September 2001 and the development of a comprehensive multilateral strategy against terrorism.
In recognising the determination of the European Union and its Member States to safeguard its citizens from acts of terrorism, we stress the need to reassure the public by striking the right balance between vigilance and enabling everyday life to continue.
We consider that each Member State must carry out a complete reassessment of its approach to the security of infrastructure and installations, particularly the most risk-sensitive such as nuclear installations.
We recognise there is genuine public concern about these issues but would like to emphasise the need to keep these matters in perspective.
I would like to emphasise that the safety of nuclear plants and other such industrial installations is primarily a national competence and responsibility.
In that context we look, for example, to the United Kingdom government to take all necessary short-term protective measures as well as to face up to the necessary longer-term decisions with regard to the disposal of radioactive waste.
Clearly, the events of 11 September 2001 in the United States call for a reassessment of the risk of attack on installations that we have previously regarded as secure and I welcome the statement from the Commissioner.
I only regret that it was not possible for Commissioner Loyola de Palacio to be able to speak to us - it had been our wish to hold this debate at the next part-session.
President, the basic premise of terrorism is that the unexpected, the unconsidered, the unbelievable will terrify the population into accepting political claims, whether they are rational or not.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement.
I welcome the cooperation you have outlined and the special attention which will be given to nuclear installations.
I hope that Member States will cooperate with the Commission in this work.
Our reaction must be to do all that we can to prevent the sort of widespread slaughter, injury and chaos we saw in the United States.
Air travel, nuclear power stations, chemical works and oil depots, are all obvious targets for terrorists.
They are designed, built and protected accordingly at very considerable cost to the public.
The French government now protects the reprocessing centre at La Hague with fighter planes and missiles.
No doubt the United Kingdom does likewise in Sellafield.
We cannot inhabit the weird minds of terrorists, but we can pay the high cost of protection.
We can work together and we can be very careful when we consider building, or indeed retaining, a potential target.
Things will not be the same after 11 September, as many others have said.
No one had conceived of using a fully loaded, large passenger plane as a weapon.
We have to factor that into our calculations.
Please keep reporting to Parliament.
We want the citizens of Europe to know that everything possible has been done to keep them safe.
Madam President, Commissioner, we have reached a serious point, a very serious point.
The worst-case scenario of terrorist air attacks on nuclear power stations, long condemned by the Greens and anti-nuclear citizens, is becoming, through force of circumstance, a valid hypothesis.
The fact that France has called on its armed forces in an attempt to protect its reactors is evidence that air attacks on nuclear plants are plausible.
The French authorities, which have always dismissed the possibility of terrorist attacks, are now forced to admit that their nuclear temples are indeed vulnerable.
And will the ground-to-air missiles deployed around the re-processing plant in The Hague be effective against a suicide attack?
The German authorities and the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna recognise that even the sturdiest nuclear power station would not survive a crash.
Throughout Europe and elsewhere in the world, the danger is certainly present, and it is made all the more acute because of the overwhelming number of nuclear reactors.
We cannot currently guarantee the safety of our citizens.
They are concerned and quite rightly so.
Has the Commission taken these disaster scenarios seriously?
How will it ensure the safety of our citizens?
And does the Commission intend to launch a study into the safety of nuclear power stations, as Germany has?
Lastly, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret the fact that my fellow Members from other groups did not deem it necessary to follow this debate with a resolution.
Madam President, Commissioner, the question regarding the safety of Europe' s skies is being considered in terms of immediate and urgent measures.
It is also being considered in terms of longer-term measures regarding security standards in aircraft and at boarding.
We have duly noted the Commission statements, particularly on the various measures taken regarding checks on passengers, on hand luggage, as well as on flights from third countries. In my view, these are wise comments.
We must also accelerate the completion of security programmes relating to checks on hold luggage and ensure that our decisions have been implemented.
I shall not go back over what was said earlier regarding the scandalous situation involving the AZF factory, only a few weeks after we held debates in this Chamber.
As far as safety on aircraft and at boarding are concerned, the events of 11 September show that two measures must be taken in aircraft design: cockpits must be sealed off and video monitors must be installed to enable the pilot to see anyone nearing the cockpit.
Secondly, there is the issue of transponders.
Transponders transmit the aircraft' s code and position to the air traffic control tower.
Transponders must be secure and it must no longer be possible to disconnect them during flights, as was the case during the attacks on the United States.
I would also like to draw Parliament' s attention to the issue of aid to the European airline industry.
To be honest, I think that it is extremely tactless, even provocative, for the Commission to open the debate on concentration within the airline industry at this point in time.
In addition to the economic battering that companies are taking, to confirm that Europe only has enough room for four or five airlines amounts to inviting mergers, restructuring and therefore redundancy plans.
On the other hand, several sources are predicting a 15 to 30% decrease in air traffic and the European Association of Air Carriers states that overall traffic levels will have decreased by more than 7% by 2002, incurring losses estimated to be over three billion euro.
In my view, the regulations on state aid to airlines must be extended in order to take into full consideration all the consequences of 11 September.
Lastly, I would like to say one final word to point out that these public funds are intended to help companies to continue to be viable.
I believe, therefore, that it is our duty to ensure that they are used and to avoid any redundancies in the sector.
Mr President, the goalposts have now changed, given the sheer level of inhumanity shown by terrorists pursuing their so-called political objectives.
Terrorists are now willing to engage in suicide missions.
This simply means that the international community must now fully re-evaluate how best it can put in place security measures to defeat these acts of blatant and premeditated terrorism.
From an Irish perspective, we are deeply concerned about the safety and security arrangements at the Sellafield nuclear plant in Cumbria.
At a time when one would expect a scaling-down of nuclear enterprises in Britain, the British government has announced that the MOX nuclear facility can go ahead at Sellafield.
Instead of closing the Sellafield nuclear plant on safety, environmental and economic grounds, the British governments has agreed to the expansion of operations there.
This is not only a problem for the Irish people: it is also a problem for the British people and for the wider European Union.
For instance, how do the British people like the idea of trains carrying nuclear materials continuing to run through London and other cities in Britain?
While the American government has halted the movement of potentially dangerous nuclear materials, BNFL is insisting that it will run its nuclear trains from reactors to its controversial Sellafield reprocessing plant.
In this growing atmosphere of international terrorism, surely it is grossly irresponsible to continue this transportation.
Equally, the transportation of nuclear materials via the Irish Sea sends shivers down the spine of many people living in Ireland.
As a representative of the East coast of Ireland, I have always resented the Irish Sea being used as a rubbish tip for the activities of British Nuclear Fuels.
The decision of the British government to expand the operations of the Sellafield nuclear plant is a contentious one by any stretch of the imagination.
The timing of this decision, however, is a highly cynical one, considering that it was made as a smokescreen at the same time as war was declared on terrorism.
This is a clear case of the British government using the war on terrorism to distract attention from awkward and contentious decisions.
In this climate this is simply not good enough.
The safety and security at the Sellafield plant is as much a matter of concern for the European Union as it is for the Irish and British governments.
The British government should make the honourable decision to close this nuclear white elephant once and for all.
But over the next few weeks the Commission should and must carry out a full and independent evaluation of all the environmental public health risks of all operations of BNFL at the Sellafield nuclear plant.
The people of Ireland are fed up with pious assurances from BNFL and the British government about safety standards at Sellafield.
We were all horrified recently when BNFL had to bring back nuclear materials from Japan, because it had falsified documents.
After this incident alone, how can any reasonable person believe for one moment anything that is written in a press release by BNFL?
I can assure all Members of this House that we in Ireland will vigorously pursue every political, legal and diplomatic option open to us to force the British government to close the Sellafield nuclear plant.
This Sellafield nuclear plant has achieved nothing, except to heap environmental misery on us all.

Mr President, Commissioner, the crisis in air transport unfolding before our very eyes following the terrorist attack on 11 September is, of course, exacerbated by factors such as structural problems in airline companies, the absence, so far, at least, of a single European airspace, which we hope will soon become a reality, and public concern about the safety of air transport.
We need to act as quickly as possible.
When we attended the ICAO assembly in Montreal recently with the European Parliament delegation, we clearly stated the European position that international measures should be taken at ministerial level by the end of the year.
And, of course, if, our hopes notwithstanding, there are delays, I think that the European Union should proceed unilaterally in order to establish a climate of safety in air transport.
As you all know, the Commission recently proposed an initial package of measures, referred to as ECAC document 30.
The parliamentary Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has promised to examine it as quickly as possible so that these measures can be turned into Community law by the end of the year, which is also in keeping with the Council's wishes.
For the same reason, the other three legislative proposals relating to safety will also be examined as quickly as possible.
There is also another package of measures relating to safety in the cockpit, video cameras, ground/air communications etc., that is, the measures to which the Commissioner referred.
As far as this matter is concerned, my point is that we are worried about the delay and about how the Member States' experts have worked up to now.
We trust that they will take the hint and improve their working methods from now on.
We are witnessing serious economic losses not just in air transport but in trade, tourism and other sectors of the economy.
We would be failing in our duty if we did not do our utmost to deal with this crisis.
Mr President, there is no doubt that nuclear power installations are not wholly safe from terrorist attacks.
No reactor could withstand the impact of a Boeing 747.
It would simply be wrong to assert anything else.
What is true of nuclear installations, though, is also true of other technological systems.
Mr Vitorino rightly pointed out that even a dam can be destroyed, and the Second World War shows that the consequences can be devastating.
An attack on a gasometer, such as can be found in the heart of our towns, could be positively appalling.
I might mention that some pressurised gasometers already operate at a lower pressure for safety reasons.
If methane were to escape from a high-pressure holder - a heavy machine-gun would suffice to bring that about - and spread over the town, then once it mixed to a certain degree with the surrounding air, the town would simply burn to the ground.
Accidents of this sort have occurred in the past; thank God we have managed to avoid them in the past ten years.
The same applies to the water supply.
It is relatively straightforward to poison water.
We can all imagine how immense the consequences of that would be.
Now, I accept that many in our countries are opposed to nuclear energy, and that, in some countries, they may well be in the majority.
Although it is not an opinion that I share, it is one that I respect.
This argument, based on the risk of terrorist attacks, could lead us to get rid of the gas industry or stop drinking water, and I find that absurd.
My conclusion simply follows the line taken by the Commission.
I admit it is not likely to make very good press copy, but it does have the advantage of being sensible.
We should identify the dangerous sites and improve the protection of targets.
Perhaps we should also take other security measures, but these must be implemented without delay.
Studies are something we do not need.
Mr President, please allow me a final word. We should not give the impression of total security.
That can be had only at the price of total surveillance, which cannot be reconciled with a free state under the rule of law.
Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, I should like to make a few observations.
Our group has already talked about the consequences of recent events for nuclear power plants and mentioned, inter alia, a package of measures which is already being discussed in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
We endorse the quest for common security regulations, such as those formulated in document 30 of the E.C.A.C. What we are mainly concerned with here, in addition to issues of supervision, is adopting a special approach to vulnerable areas.
We, of course, are of the opinion that such a debate must in any case be genuine, certainly when it comes to protecting privacy.
I should like to bring one aspect to your attention, for we are concerned here with an extension of the threat to include not only additional targets but also additional modes of transport.
I would like to draw your attention to the use of other means of transport - something which we have already noted - such as tankers containing chemicals, and ask the Commissioner for his thoughts on the matter.
In shipping too, it is relatively simple to force a ship in a port such as Rotterdam to take a different course and to direct it towards very explosive installations.
In other words, not only aviation but also other means of transport should be discussed.
Mr President, installations at risk, such as nuclear power plants, flood-control dams, ports, oil depots, extremely tall buildings and research centres for biological warfare and for genetic manipulation will never lose their appeal for terrorists.
That is why we must ensure that the number of installations which can threaten the life of human communities and of our environment is reduced to a minimum.
Instead of subsidising airline companies with tax money, enabling them to continue pulling off stunts involving low prices, it would be preferable to completely close vulnerable regions to air traffic.
Moreover, vulnerable airports near cities or with insufficient security provisions in place, as in the recent case of Linate near Milan - an airport that should have been closed down years ago - should not have a future.
The unbalanced pursuit of economic growth, freedom for airline companies and the rolling back of government has, in connection with the sad events of 11 September, led to too little attention being paid, on the one hand, to the risk of industrial buildings collapsing and, on the other hand, to government supervision of access to airports by people with malicious intentions.
It is not the first time that I am bringing these two matters to the attention of the Commission.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 11 September will go down as a crucial date in the history of the modern era in general and for the aviation sector in particular, for which we can talk about a before and an after.
I wish, first of all, to express my solidarity with the victims of these cowardly and barbaric attacks and with the government of the United States and also to unreservedly, roundly and unambiguously condemn terrorism.
Improving the security of transport users and transported goods was and must continue to be one of the Union' s priorities for action in coming years.
I am delighted that this is the view adopted in the White Paper on transport policy presented by the Commission only a few months ago.
We must not forget that a safe journey is the most important right of any passenger.
The ongoing safety and competitiveness of this sector require the rapid adoption of the latest Commission proposals on air safety and the 'single sky' package.
We must also take account of other measures that were already on the table, such as the JAR-OPS Regulation, the draft directive on occurrence reporting in civil aviation and the proposal on the professional competence of cabin crew.
All of these texts, Commissioner, must be approved as soon as possible.
To conclude, I would say that the disastrous action taken on the air transport sector in recent weeks has shown the extent to which the European Union has a pivotal role in responding to the need for regulation at both Community and world-wide level.
Only a European vision will enable us to confront new challenges such as international terrorism, for which international intergovernmental forums can no longer provide a sufficiently rapid or effective response.
Parliament has a duty to support the Commission on these proposals to restore the public confidence and safety that have been lost.
It is at times like this that we must make Europe' s presence felt.
Lastly, I also wish to address the Council, which must now find the ability and the courage to support and take decisions that ensure that civil aviation will continue to be safe, reliable and sustainable from every point of view.
I wish to deal briefly with two issues: one I have already addressed, that is the state of the airline industry in Europe.
I welcome the fact that the Commissioner has announced that the European Union is going to meet with the US authorities to discuss unfair competition, but that is a grossly inadequate response to the current crisis in the aviation industry.
I would like some clarity about what precisely the Commission is doing.
There is a report in Irish newspapers today that the Commission is insisting that the rescue and aid package the Irish government will provide for Aer Lingus must be privately funded.
Now, that is a gross distortion of the treaties which are neutral as regards where aid or money should come from to assist the aviation industry.
I want clarity on this.
Is that what the Commission is demanding or is the Irish government playing its own privatisation game under cover of the present crisis?
The second point I wish to make is in relation to the nuclear and chemical industries in Europe.
The report which is coming before STOA this week makes for worrying reading.
It will hopefully be made public very soon, but the reality is that Sellafield and Cap de la Hague were a risk even before 11 September 2001; the chemical plants in our midst were a risk even before Toulouse.
It seems to me that we need commitments from the Commission that we are going to have an independent European inspectorate.
Madam President, after the 11 September atrocity we are in a new situation.
Acts of malice and not just accidents are the focus of our concern.
No-fly zones should be established immediately around the two reprocessing plants in the EU: Sellafield and Cap de la Hague.
Power plants generally are a ticking time-bomb in our midst.
The only logical response is to close them all down and end this terrible threat.
The French government has already moved to strengthen anti-terrorist precautions at Cap de la Hague.
These include ground-to-air missiles.
The German government has concluded that nuclear reactors could not withstand a collision with a targeted passenger jet.
It has undertaken an emergency risk assessment.
Government ministers oppose anti-aircraft defences and have made it clear that plants that lie in the flight paths of large airports can be shut down if they are rated as serious risk.
The US government has halted the transport of nuclear materials, and the EU government should also immediately halt the transport of nuclear materials, including MOX fuels.
I do not believe that the response we have had so far from the Commission is at all adequate.
The IAEA has confirmed that 75% of the notifications of incidents involving nuclear material in the last year were illegal activities.
Nuclear materials are currently clearly not secure and not safe.
Neither Sellafield nor la Hague was designed to withstand the impact of a commercial jet.
They contain tens of thousands of tonnes of spent nuclear fuel and over 100 tonnes of separated plutonium between them.
A new report, which is both timely and in terms of content deeply worrying, has been prepared for the European Parliament.
I understand it will be circulated tomorrow by the STOA committee.
I expect it to be circulated.
I wonder why it has not already been circulated to Members, as I believe it has already been circulated to the industry?
The report states that an act of malice - and this was presented to us before September - could initiate a sequence of events that release radioactive material in the liquid high-level waste tanks, in Sellafield in particular, with effects much greater and more devastating than Chernobyl.
This is very serious.
I need an adequate response from the Commission, and so far we have not had it.
Mr President, I made my point about the STOA report when we were discussing the order of business.
Successive Irish governments have voiced their concern about the operation of the Sellafield plant, formerly known as Windscale, and in particular the innumerable security breaches by the BNFL and the arrogance of the British authorities towards the legitimate concerns of a sovereign and friendly neighbour.
The commissioning of the MOX plant when the eyes of the international media were firmly focused elsewhere in the wake of the tragedy of September 11, 2001 is but the latest example, and is particularly serious, given the heightened concerns now of terrorist attacks.
Could the Commission confirm that the same security standards that are now deemed necessary in Cap de la Hague - that is protection with fighter planes and ground-to-air missiles and a no-fly zone - are in place in Sellafield?
Does the Commission agree that there is an urgent need for common security standards for all nuclear installations, not just in the EU-15, but in accession countries as well?
Could the Commission also comment on the lack of effectiveness of the present inspectorate in this regard?
Mr President, I am very grateful to the Commission for using today's statement to take up a theme that currently causes a great deal of concern to the people of Europe.
I also welcome the way the Commission deals explicitly with all the areas at especial risk, and, in particular, its inclusion of industrial plant and nuclear power stations, which was demanded on Austria's initiative in Parliament's resolution on the events of 11 September.
We know that precautions were taken at several nuclear power stations in Europe to enable them to survive the impact of smaller aircraft at least.
Does the Commission have an overview showing which nuclear power stations did not do this, and what is planned at a European level to reinforce protection measures overall, at least at these stations but also at all others?
We know that no nuclear power station is completely safe, and that some are not technically up to date in other respects of relevance to safety.
It would be all the more surprising if there really were a letter from Commissioner Verheugen, confirming that the Temelin plant is completely safe.
As such a statement would contradict everything international experts have found out about Temelin, I cannot believe that this statement about its safety was actually made by Mr Verheugen.
I therefore ask the Commission to show this document, addressed to the Czech and Austrian governments, to Parliament.
We have been very committed to this issue, and I think Parliament deserves, even if the Commission takes an opposing view....
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, much as I love Senator Doyle and her Irish friends, she is quite wrong about Sellafield in my constituency.
I told her so, and the Irish government so when I was the Northern Ireland Minister responsible for Energy and I reiterate that view now.
I applaud the British government's decision on the MOX plant, a long overdue decision which is going to ensure the economic and employment future of my constituents.
So my message on that is to keep your hands off Sellafield.
Briefly, about aviation.
I congratulate Commissioner Palacio on the actions that she has already taken but there are three things we need to emphasise: firstly we must protect the aircraft on the ground; once someone is on the aircraft they can do more damage.
Secondly we must renew and reinvigorate security screening at airports and thirdly we must assist with the costs of security and war-risk insurance.
We must restore public confidence in aviation and the sooner the better.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, personally speaking, I believe that I can welcome the fact that the approach adopted by the Commission with regard to both air safety and security and the safety of industrial and nuclear installations has received wide support from Members here.
To sum up, I will add that we have drawn up an intervention programme, which strictly observes competences - not simply Community competences, but Member States' competences as well.
That is why I can assure you that, as regards matters for which the Commission has direct responsibility under the Treaties, we have taken all the necessary measures to deal with the new situation created by the terrorist attacks on the United States.
We shall continue to put pressure on the Member States so that they also shoulder their responsibilities and adopt the necessary measures that are part of their competences.
This applies to the examples given regarding the security of the Sellafield and Cap de La Hague re-processing plants.
I would like to stress that this is part of national competences and that it is the national authorities that inform us that the necessary measures have been taken.
The Commission recognises the need to begin an assessment of nuclear security and the security of transporting nuclear materials.
I mentioned this in my presentation and I hope that the assessment that the Commission is currently preparing will soon be completed.
As far as air safety and security are concerned, I am pleased that several Members of Parliament have welcomed our legislative initiative with open arms and I hope that the regulation that we have proposed can be examined by Parliament as a matter of urgency.
I would also like to stress that we must improve how we follow up on measures taken at national level, just as the ad hoc group is doing, which is responsible for assessing specific administrative measures that need to be taken to improve air security.
Mr President, I would like to make a final comment.
I referred to the conditions relating to competition and to the strategy implemented by the Commission to avoid distorting competition within the context of the Euro-American dialogue on security.
This was the context in which I dealt with the issue of competition.
We believe that the solutions we are seeking must be international and must take into consideration the need to avoid imposing measures that are excessive and which may distort competition globally.
This was the background to what I said.
I did not mention other measures concerning competition policy related to the effects of the terrorist attacks on the commercial strategy of airlines.
I did not deal with specific questions, such as those that some Members of Parliament wanted to bring up during the debate.
All I can do is refer Members to the conclusions of the meeting that my colleague, Mrs Loyola De Palacio, held with the representatives of the airline companies' association.
I have taken careful note of the fact that some of you thought that the Commission proposals were insufficient or too ideological.
I have taken careful note of your comments. I shall pass them on to Mrs De Palacio, but I repeat that, for the time being, this is the official position of the Commission.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Mr Fitzsimons has the floor on a point of order.
It is not the first time I have heard Commissioners come into this House and say they have no obligations in relation to nuclear power plants and that this is a matter for the Member States.
But clearly the European Commission should and must carry out an independent evaluation of all the environmental and public health risks, not just for Ireland and for all the UK but for all the people of Europe.
This has been side-stepped down the years but it is high time that the Commission bites the bullet.
For this type of question, you can contact the Commissioner directly.
I just want to agree with what my colleague Mr Fitzsimons says.
I have a report here by Parliament, from the STOA committee.
Mrs Ahern, I will say the same to you that I said to Mr Fitzsimons: this is not a point of order.
European judicial area/SIS II
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports by Mr von Boetticher, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs:
A5-0339/2001 on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a general framework for Community activities to facilitate the implementation of a European judicial area in civil matters
[COM(2001) 221 - C5-0254/2001 - 2001/0109(CNS)];
A5-0333/2001 on the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium and of the Kingdom of Sweden with a view to the adoption:
1. of a Council Regulation on the development of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II)
[9844/2001 - C5-0315/2001 - 2001/0818(CNS)]
2. of a Council Decision on the development of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II)
[9845/2001 - C5-0316/2001 - 2001/0819(CNS)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today sees the fulfilment of a small dream.
I have ten minutes' speaking time, as much as only a Group chairman can normally expect.
This, however, comes about through the grouping together of two reports, which do not actually belong together.
So I would prefer to speak on them separately.
Let me begin with the area of civil law.
When the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993, judicial cooperation in civil matters became a matter of common concern for the Member States.
Then the Treaty of Amsterdam, by means of Article 65 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, transferred this cooperation from the third pillar to the first.
Its entry into force brought about active European lawmaking.
Regulations on conflicts of law or of jurisdiction were adjusted, the Council directive on insolvency procedures and on the service of legal documents in civil and commercial cases was adopted, and draft directives on the gathering of evidence and on rights of access in matrimonial cases were submitted to the Council.
The entry into force of the present Treaty of Nice means that future decisions on judicial cooperation in civil matters will finally be reached by codecision procedure with qualified majority in the Council.
You can see that things in this field are developing at breakneck speed.
Member States will continue to have sole responsibility for the framework and content of professional training in civil law, but it will be the Community's responsibility to support them whether in the removal of obstacles to the application of Community law or in the cooperation of the judicial authorities.
In no area of European law is continuing professional education so imperative as in civil law, in which harmonisation has already made progress.
Criminal and administrative law, on the other hand, are still only at the beginning of their European development.
This continuing education was formerly supported by two EU programmes.
GROTIUS, the joint incentive and exchange programme for the legal profession, came to an end in 2000.
This promotion was maintained only by a successor programme, GROTIUS Programme Civil, which was limited to one year.
The same year saw the expiry of the Robert Schuman Project, which had been limited to three years and served to make lawyers more aware of Community law.
The Commission proposal before us today now represents the legal basis for further financial support for activities in the field of legal cooperation in civil matters.
It promotes judicial cooperation and improved mutual understanding of legal systems, as well as measures to transpose and implement Community legislation in this area and better information for the public.
For the first time, alongside finance for specific projects, there is the prospect of financial help with the running costs of European NGOs.
I can only emphatically support that.
The facilitation of involvement by the acceding countries is also especially to be welcomed.
Apart from the essential rejoicing at the direction of this draft, which is made all the greater by the generous financial framework amounting to EUR 14.5 million up to 2006, there remain a few critical points.
The stipulation that NGOs can only apply for support if two-thirds of the Member States participate in them can hardly be complied with even today.
The prospect of enlargement therefore makes it a matter of urgency to reduce this hurdle to one-third, or else this directive's good beginnings will be nipped in the bud.
I also wonder why the Commission, contrary to its former practice - for example in the context of the GROTIUS programmes - has omitted to define precisely who is entitled to apply, members of the legal profession in this case.
The debate on the money-laundering directive showed us how vital it is in this area to define terms.
Member States must not have discretion to define terms when support with European funds is at issue.
I have therefore proposed the adoption of the old definition from the GROTIUS civil law programme.
I would also like to say, on this point, that I would have been glad if the EU had continued to bear up to 80% of project costs, rather than reducing this share to 50%.
This was, however, not what the relevant committee wanted.
I think, though, that the EU continues to bear a great responsibility for the further development of judicial cooperation.
This responsibility is likely to increase rather than decrease in the future.
Here, too, we must continue to be a motive force.
So much for the first part concerning the area of civil law; I now come to the debate on the Schengen Information System.
The Schengen Information System was established in 1995 on the basis of the Convention of 1990 which implemented the Schengen Agreement.
Today, as a police investigation system overlapping states and supported by computers, it facilitates online access to over 8 million items of data produced by investigations and is thus the most comprehensive database in Europe.
It is used by Iceland and Norway as well as thirteen EU Member States.
All this makes SIS a successful component of a new European internal security policy, made necessary by the dismantling of internal borders and the resulting loss of surveillance.
Two problems concern us today, the first being advances in technology.
The Schengen Information System as we know it today was originally conceived for eighteen Member States.
The fact that all the present acceding countries will join in SIS on their accession makes it urgently necessary to give thought today to what will be its successor.
Technology has moved on in the meantime as well.
The initiative taken by the kingdoms of Sweden and Belgium to develop SIS II are therefore much to be welcomed.
As the development of SIS II will require over three years' preparatory work, these initiatives lay the necessary legal foundations for its budget.
The originators have, however, overshot their mark a bit.
In order to ensure the maximum influence on technical development, the Member States are to take part in the comitological process through a combination of administrative and regulatory committees.
This will therefore involve a maximum of additional bureaucratic effort.
It is not clear to me why, at a development stage where only technical aspects are to be discussed, the Member States are to join in discussing and deciding on every detail.
The suggestion that a regulatory committee should be in place to deal with all matters concerning the system's architecture and with data protection issues, also goes against Council decision 468/99. This stated that recourse should be had to the regulatory procedure only for measures of general scope intended to apply essential provisions of basic legal instruments.
Such is quite evidently not the case here.
At this stage, I would like to point out to the representatives of the Council that, for example, when Eurodac was set up, there was deliberately no official participatory procedure, and the Member States exerted their influence only through an informal network of technical experts.
This saved us all a great deal of time and money and still produced an effective result.
At the same time, I have confidence in the technical know-how in this field possessed by the Commission, which is entrusted with guiding this development.
I therefore suggest to Member States that they replace the superfluous bureaucratic combination of administrative and regulatory procedure by a combination of administrative and consultative procedure.
Less is sometimes more.
The second problem is the development of law.
The Member States did admittedly decide as early as the Amsterdam Inter-Governmental Conference to integrate the Schengen Agreement into the European legal area, but lack of agreement meant that the Schengen Information System was assigned to the third pillar.
There is no doubt, however, that collection of data on persons who have been barred from entering a Member State is within the scope of the first pillar.
This is another reason why we have two initiatives today, one by the Belgian Presidency and another by Sweden.
As Europe's Parliament, we strive to integrate Schengen and the Schengen Information System into the first pillar, and as a whole if at all possible.
It is only in that way that appropriate parliamentary control can be guaranteed.
So I will go on the record as welcoming, as a step in this direction, the financing of Schengen II out of Community funds with effect from 2002.
The initiative unfortunately forgets to submit to Parliament the Commission's half-yearly interim reports on the stage the development has reached.
It is scarcely comprehensible that the budget procedure of the European Community should be applied to finance Schengen II without the body legislating for that budget - namely Parliament - being informed about these developments at the time.
However much the direction taken by the report's contents may be worthy of approval, in this respect there must be clear improvement.
Apart from that, I can only give my full and wholehearted support to the proposals as a whole.
I crave your indulgence for having to leave in about a quarter of an hour - as indeed must other ladies and gentlemen - but we have a meeting of the Committee on Citizen' s Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
We have some votes to take part in there as well.
So there is no disrespect for this House.
Thank you, Mr von Boetticher.
We are aware of this problem of meetings being scheduled to take place at the same time, especially with the aforementioned Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate Mr von Boetticher on his work on the two reports that he has just presented to us.
I should like to focus on the second report that deals with the Schengen system, which has come before Parliament not for reasons of clear political will, but because the Council has not been able to achieve unanimity on maintaining the system of intergovernmental funding, whilst a source of Community funding is also necessary.
These are the peculiarities of our work in the European institutions: many things happen for strange reasons and as a result of stopgap solutions.
I should like to say that this proposal to develop a new generation Schengen Information System, SIS II, can only be accepted as the first, preparatory, stage in the system' s development.
Community funding will not solve the problems that divide us in our analyses of the functioning of the SIS.
It is crucial, as I argued here last September, when I presented my report on Schengen, that in addition to Community funding, the Schengen Information System cannot continue to be managed in secret and on a purely intergovernmental basis. It must instead be managed at European Union level by a separate agency.
At the same time, a single Community information system must be set up consisting of a computer network system that contains data received under the three conventions, Schengen, Europol and Customs, bearing in mind the need to keep the data held under these conventions separate.
This is the only way in which we will be able to guarantee an adequate level of protection for personal data, which is fair and identical for all citizens, complying with the level of protection stipulated by the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Lastly, we know that the SIS is reaching saturation point with eighteen States participating, which means that it will not be able to survive beyond the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union, which also means that we must rapidly adapt the system.
I hope that the five years we have ahead of us will be long enough to present a proposal that is balanced and which meets the demands of the European Parliament.

Mr President, the initiative by Belgium and Sweden on the development of a second generation SIS system is underpinned by two legal bases: the decision laid down in the Treaty on European Union and the regulation laid down in the EC Treaty. This initiative addresses the objectives of the system, which serves both judicial and police cooperation in criminal matters under the third pillar and the fields of visas, asylum and immigration and others concerning the free movement of people under the first pillar.
These initiatives are the real premises of the preliminary work that must be undertaken in order to create the new SIS II system.
They have come into being, as has already been stated, as a result of the rejection of intergovernmental funding by some Member States and are based on the Commission' s willingness to take the risk and the political responsibility for going ahead with the development of this new information system in the years to come.
The SIS, which, as we know, has only been a Community instrument since 1999, has matured very quickly.
Although it was designed for twelve Member States, it now serves thirteen plus Iceland and Norway and we now have the United Kingdom and Ireland knocking on the door.
As we know, in the current historical circumstances, it provides a vital European source of information on citizens of third countries and assets that have disappeared or been stolen, given the immensity of the task of controlling our external borders or movement within any part of Community territory.
With the imminence of the new round of enlargement and given the challenges of adapting the new technologies and the new requirements, of which we are all aware, it is crucial that we develop the current system by providing Community funding for its modernisation.
The requirement for its development towards the so-called second generation SIS is, today, crucial to detecting threats arising from the situation of third-country nationals, in order to provisionally arrest criminals who qualify for extradition, to help to locate people who have disappeared or been kidnapped, to monitor dangerous individuals and to retrieve stolen goods and assets.
I am delighted to have the support of Mr von Boetticher, who has done an excellent job.
I also believe that tomorrow' s final vote on this report will produce a text on which it will be much easier for Parliament to agree on an opinion.
Mr President, only budgetary funding can give coherence to the new Community nature of the Schengen acquis, of which the current and future information systems are a part.
Furthermore, the new requirements for online and in tempo judicial information and cooperation should be able to guarantee the security of Europe' s citizens.
I therefore feel, Mr President, that we must not get bogged down in the minutiae of accounting procedures or of the law.
The important thing is that the SIS moves ahead, to the benefit of the citizens of Europe.
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur for this.
The rapporteur has produced two excellent reports.
He makes a first-class contribution to the work of the committee which I have the honour to chair.
I would like to talk very briefly about the first of these reports to do with the freedom of movement of people.
It is essential that we have a European legal space and that we pursue its development with judicial cooperation in civil matters.
The rapporteur quite rightly identifies the problems here and recognises that just as the single market required a massive benchmarking exercise, a massive exercise in approximation and mutual recognition, so too will the development of a European legal space require this.
In the second report the rapporteur looks at the problems that have emerged with the Schengen Information System and the opportunity to move forward to the second version of it, which clearly will be needed with enlargement.
We have here, in Strasbourg, with the central Schengen computer system, the most comprehensive databank in Europe.
It must be financed from our budget.
Sadly, the Belgian and Swedish initiatives, which propose a regulation for the First Pillar and a decision for the Third Pillar, show how ridiculous it is still to be operating with these two pillars.
In particular, Article 96, which is the article governing the data on those refused entry, must be in the First Pillar.
It contains the personal details of 1.3 million people and will contain substantially more with enlargement of the Union.
In conclusion I would draw the House's attention to the report from Justice last year that found significant defects in data protection, poor quality of data and obstacles placed in the way of individuals seeking to correct mistakes.
We must take account of this.
Mr President, instead of talking here today about the approval of a new generation of the Schengen Information System SIS II, we ought much rather to be discussing the disastrous consequences of the information system we already have.
I find it scandalous that the overwhelming majority of the persons listed in the SIS have not been charged with any criminal offence.
Only 11 000 people have their names stored in these computers because of an arrest warrant for the purpose of deporting them, but there are 780 000 listed as barred from entering any of the EU's Member States.
Article 99 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement states that the SIS can also be used to - as it is termed - obtain information in order to repel a significant danger originating from a specified person, or other significant dangers.
This provision means that the names of quite blameless citizens are to be found in the SIS computers.
This data was, for example, used in issuing demonstrators with unjustified bans on entry when the summit was held in Genoa.
As long as this continues, we cannot give any support to the further development of this Schengen Information System.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr von Boetticher for his work and also the Members who spoke after him.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for what has been gained through Parliament' s work, although we do feel that an essential element, democratic control, is missing.
Once again, we are being forced to agree to providing Community funding, as Mr Marinho said, in order to be able to have a say as well.
However, we feel that the European Council is continuing to do an appalling job, which, moreover, consists both of greatly increasing the number of databanks, and of greatly increasing the amount of data.
We know that, in addition to SIS, there are the - albeit revised - Europol and Eurodac databanks etc., and the latest addition will be the databank containing the index of criminal records used by Eurojust.
Hitherto, SIS has been a huge collection of information and notes on people and objects: it contains data entered by each Member State according to different laws and criteria which has been accessible to users at different levels of responsibility.
Among the errors which may have already been made, consider the case of the US citizen arrested in Belgium because he had lost his passport whom SIS recorded as a passport thief.
Reference has been made to the events in Genoa: thousands of people had been recorded in SIS after the incidents in Gothenburg, but this was of no benefit to the Italian police.
Basically, our view is that there will not only be more States entering data in this bank but also, essentially, more data.
Lastly, we do not believe that total control is compatible with the rule of law, as has been maintained.
Mr President, I congratulate Mr von Boetticher.
I am speaking on the European judicial area in civil matters.
When the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force, judicial cooperation in civil matters was transferred from the third pillar to the first, since when the European Community has elaborated an ambitious work programme in that area.
A detailed examination of the GROTIUS programme led to the conclusion that a new, more general, framework for activities in this field was needed.
The new framework regulation makes it possible to continue the projects already financed by the GROTIUS programme.
I thoroughly welcome this draft regulation by the Commission, which is intended to create a legal basis for the financing of judicial cooperation in civil matters by the EU Budget.
For the first time, the framework regulation also makes possible financial support for European non-governmental organisations, provided that these function on a non-profit basis and that their objectives serve to promote judicial cooperation.
It is greatly to be welcomed that acceding countries and third countries are able to participate in all these activities.
The limitation, proposed by the rapporteur and adopted by the Committee, to one-third of the involved Member States, is realistic and far-sighted, especially against the backdrop of the imminent enlargement up to 2006.
This regulation does not apply in Denmark, Ireland or the United Kingdom.
Legal practitioners in these countries can, however, participate in the projects alongside their counterparts from the acceding countries and elsewhere.
The concept of 'legal advisers' in this regulation has a quite different background from that in the directive on money laundering.
For that reason definition by means of a concluding list, as proposed by the rapporteur, would in this case inhibit the flexible use of this regulation in the future and limit its scope.
This is true, in particular, because it is difficult to translate correctly into all the Community languages without giving the terms for the relevant legal profession a different meaning, especially since individual Member States might in the future add other types of legal practitioner, who would then be barred from participation.
I would therefore prefer it if there were no list of these occupations.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what is the Schengen Information System meant to achieve?
It aims to improve police cooperation in criminal law matters, to harmonise immigration and visa policy and to monitor the free movement of persons.
This monitoring, though, is targeted not least at migrants, who find it impossible or virtually impossible to travel to the EU legally, and the great majority of whom are fleeing situations that the EU may well not have created on its own but has substantially helped to bring about.
As many people have already mentioned today, the system is directed against those of the EU's citizens who incur its displeasure by wanting, for example, at a summit meeting, to express their disapproval of an EU policy which is characterised by lockouts and the capitalisation of essential areas of life.
It is becoming clear what this update of the Schengen Information System amounts to.
On the one hand, it is about the efficient use of the surveillance which technology and geography make possible.
At the same time, the EU wants the mere existence of these possibilities to mean that use is actually made of them.
Even the apparently technical changes in these proposals are also about improving the existing surveillance structure, and so this improvement needs to be financed.
And here I must disagree with Mr Turco and say that, in my judgment, nothing whatever in this project would be changed even by democratic control.
Seeing this from the Left, I believe this proposal cannot be supported.
Basic freedoms perform quite different functions in capitalism.
From a quite pragmatic point of view, though, they do guarantee the citizen a minimum of protection from the State.
It so happens, in the present situation, that most restrictions on basic rights....
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, as we all know, the current Schengen Information System has been in operation since 1995 but did not become a Community resource until 1999 when the Schengen acquis was adopted by the European Union in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Its Community identity, therefore, implies that any proposal to replace it must be bound by the same legal considerations governing how it was set up and operates and that any extension to its purpose must be subject to full democratic scrutiny by the relevant bodies, as previous speakers have stated.
The current climate, with the need for additional measures to safeguard our citizens and the inability of the current information system to meet that need, should not provide fertile ground for arbitrary derogations from and extensions to its powers.
The proposed legal framework needs to clarify certain crucial issues.
If natural persons are to be protected against personal data processing, the joint supervisory body set up in the Schengen Agreement needs to be involved.
This authority has been commissioned to draft an annual report on how the current system functions, including a systematic review and analysis of the new data which the new system will create.
At the same time, the European Parliament needs to step up efforts to ensure that the new system functions are monitored efficiently by calling for regular progress reports.
The point here is that, as far as the continuing application of the Schengen Agreement is concerned, the Council has only updated the European Parliament once, meaning that Parliament is unaware of issues which impinge directly on the free and unimpeded movement of citizens or how the Union's borders are controlled.
Finally, we also need to mention the need to adopt a Community information system consisting of a single electronic network in order to facilitate transparent data storage, management and evaluation.
Mr President, since it started operating in 1995, the Schengen Information System has been used and is used, together with Europol, as a tool to facilitate repression at European level, to manufacture and monitor suspects, to combat resistance movements and disobedience policies and to devastate immigrants arriving in Europe looking for a place in the sun.
It has been used with particular enthusiasm every time grass roots resistance movements have been organised against the interests chosen by the European Union, in Nice, in Gothenburg and in Genoa.
A month ago, the European Parliament requested a progress report in which the rapporteur revealed the arbitrary nature and unreliability of the personal data recorded.
A few days later, the European Union rushed to make this information available to the American services to help them stifle any voice of resistance anywhere in the world and spread a new imperialist war on the pretext of fighting terrorism.
And, as if that were not enough, the recent extraordinary European Council of the European Union of the 15 gave the Americans unaccountable access to all European sources and files.
The Schengen system, be it the first generation or the second generation which we are debating today, is a constituent element in the mechanism of repression, which is why the grass roots movement is fighting to abolish it.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin with the first report by Mr von Boetticher on judicial cooperation in civil matters.
Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we have, in fact, had a particularly ambitious agenda in the field of civil judicial cooperation.
By way of example, I would say that over the last two years, five regulations in this field have already been adopted by the Council, and two other proposals are under discussion.
Two new legislative proposals are currently being prepared by the Commission.
The aim of this proposal is to contribute to the establishment of a European judicial area in civil matters.
The intention is not to propose a new action programme, but to contribute to the successful implementation of the existing action plans in this field, in particular, the Tampere conclusions.
This is why the support we suggest in these proposals is aimed not only at co-funding projects carried out by public and non-public institutions and organisations in the Member States, but also at funding Commission actions, such as actions aimed at ensuring the correct application of Community law in the civil field, which I am convinced will be of benefit to citizens.
I am very pleased to note that Mr von Boetticher has received our proposal with approval, and I would like to congratulate him on his excellent report.
With regard to the amendments proposed, the Commission accepts four out of the six of them.
I am talking about the amendments on the two new recitals proposed by the Committee on Budgets, the new recital proposed by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and the amendments on the introduction of a definition of the term 'legal practitioner' .
With regard to the amendment on the specific objectives of the framework programme, I prefer to preserve the Commission' s initial proposal, because it very closely pursues the objectives set in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council.
With regard to Amendment No 5, I well understand the rapporteur' s argument, but I believe that setting a strict threshold in relation to non-governmental organisations is also a way to promote the existence of genuine European organisations in this field.
And I believe that the threshold we are proposing will remain practical, even in the context of the enlargement of the European Union.
Furthermore, several non-governmental organisations in this field already play a significant role, including in a very significant number of the candidate countries.
Mr President, in relation to the second report on the Schengen Information System, I believe that this is a key element in the operation of the area without frontiers.
The need for a second-generation SIS was recognised some years ago.
This need is due, above all, to the limitations of the current SIS system.
The system only allows for the integration of 18 countries.
This is why the enlargement of the Union requires the development of a second-generation SIS that will permit the full integration of new Member States.
Without the SIS II we will not have the conditions appropriate for the lifting of internal border controls in the countries which are currently candidates for accession to the European Union.
The two initiatives you are debating today confirm that the European Parliament and the Commission will henceforth have an increased role in relation to the development of the SIS II, both in this initial phase in the field of funding, and in the definition of the future architecture of the system and its specific operation.
These two initiatives are in line with the conclusions of the Justice and Home Affairs Council at the end of May that favoured funding the development of SIS II by means of the Community budget from 2002.
In accordance with the two initiatives aimed at creating a committee to assist the Commission in the development of the SIS II, the European Parliament will be kept systematically informed of work in progress, by means of the institutional mechanisms for informing Parliament within the framework of commitology.
I must stress that, at the request of the Commission, a sum has been included in the 2001 draft budget for preparatory action in relation to the development of the SIS II.
Given that this is for preparatory action, and in accordance with the rules on the execution of the budget, the Commission really does not require a legal basis for these preliminary expenses, but it is nevertheless aware that it cannot develop the SIS II without calling on the experience of Member States in relation to the current SIS and its operation.
This experience is absolutely essential and the implementation of commitology offers a well-established structural solution with a view to assisting the Commission in its new responsibilities relating to the development of the SIS II.
If the principle of creating a committee to assist the Commission is acceptable, however, we would like to express our preference for a system of commitology based on the creation of an advisory committee and a management committee.
The Commission is pleased with the amendments proposed by Mr von Boetticher in this regard, and I hope that they will be approved in plenary session.
The Commission is also prepared to accept the European Parliament' s amendment on the delivery of a six-monthly report prepared by the Commission on the work on the development of the SIS II, not only to the Council but also to the European Parliament.
This is not only important with regard to the principle of transparency, but also with regard to the role the European Parliament will have to play within the framework of the legislative measures necessary for the development of the SIS II, which require that the European Parliament is kept fully informed of all work in this area.
Because, in fact, the two initiatives we are discussing today relate, above all, to the technical work involved in the implementation of the SIS II.
This implementation also requires the adoption, when the time comes, of legislative measures based on the appropriate bases in the Treaties, which the European Parliament will be consulted on.
These legislative measures will have to define all the essential elements of the SIS II, in particular, the purposes of the system, the categories of information to be included, the protection of information, control by a common control authority, the management of the future operational SIS II and the issue raised by Mr Coelho of whether or not to create an agency.
The points I have just highlighted will be the subject of a later debate, when the time comes, on the basis of the results of the feasibility study to be launched by the Commission at the beginning of 2002.
The reason that the Commission cannot support the amendments on these points today is not that we disagree with their content, but simply that to me it seems premature to deal with them within the framework of the two initiatives which are aimed solely at the funding of the development of the SIS II.
We will have the opportunity to discuss these issues again and to make decisions, when the time comes, on the basis of legislative proposals.
Please allow me to conclude with the following positive statement: the development of the SIS II is a task which will concern us in the years to come and which must be achieved within a reasonable timescale that will allow the new Member States to be integrated into it and to thereby create the conditions for them to participate in our common area without frontiers.
The adoption of your opinion today, within the three months which have followed the delivery of the two initiatives, demonstrates the will and capacity of the European Parliament, of its Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and its rapporteur, to contribute to the creation of the SIS II as soon as possible.
This gives me great pleasure.
Public participation in drawing up environmental plans and programmes
The next item is the debate on the following report (A5-0321/2001) by Mrs Korhola, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on providing for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment and amending Council Directives 85/337/EEC and 96/61/EC (COM(2000) 839 - C5-0027/2001 - 2000/0331(COD)).
Mr President, we are currently debating a directive which concerns participation by the public in decisions which affect the environment.
It is the second pillar in the legislative work whose purpose is to ratify, within the Community, the Aarhus Convention which was concluded in 1998.
I wish to express my thanks for the fact that my draft report has received copious and unanimous support in many of the points which I have put forward.
The report has, however, also stirred up some political passions.
It must be possible to find a balance between, on the one hand, guaranteeing broad opportunities for participation by citizens, and, on the other hand, avoiding deliberate and vexatious delaying tactics.
This task is not easy, especially as the structure of the Commission's basic proposal is very complicated.
The vote taken the week before last in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy led to an unfortunate and illogical conclusion, which must now be rectified in plenary session so that we can correct a situation which is embarrassing from the point of view of the Parliament's reputation.
At the moment, the report version approved in Committee contains some mutually contradictory ingredients.
I personally feel that not enough time was available to discuss and to understand the basic starting point which I put forward, and its practical consequences.
I stated that information gathering and public hearing concern the entire public at large, but I limited the legal safeguards following the decision to a more restricted public, in other words those whose rights are infringed by the decision.
It was only in this point that I failed to receive the support which I had hoped for from the major groups.
I wished to open the consultation stage to the public at large, since there is a very peculiar logic in a situation whereby an authority ends up determining in advance which part of the public a matter concerns.
How could the authority know who will be affected by it, and in what way, before the public has been heard on the issue?
And if this is already known, then hearing the public is a pointless exercise.
Such restriction is odd from the point of view of public participation, and also squanders the time and energy of the authority itself.
Since colleagues have feared that my approach means that anyone may take an authority to court, I wish to stress that just the opposite is the case.
It is precisely the Commission's version which - in setting demanding obligations for the authority - would achieve this result.
In my proposal, the right of appeal is restricted solely to those whose rights are infringed by a decision, so that appeal is not used with deliberately vexatious intent.
The opportunity to express an opinion will not automatically imply the right of appeal.
In the Commission's proposal, the public's right of participation was restricted at all stages to that public which the matter concerns.
I continue to hold that the Commission's proposal is misguided in this respect; its practical consequences will create needless difficulties in the work of the authorities.
Authorities will face uncommon difficulties in establishing whom a matter concerns; this includes all civic organisations, which according to the Commission's proposal are always interested parties.
Failure or negligence at this stage will always form grounds for taking the matter to court.
Without a doubt, in the form proposed by the Commission these provisions are indeed open to abuse - and this abuse can also take the form of slowing down projects.
My proposal was unusual in that it would have simultaneously benefited citizens who genuinely wish to participate, and also the authorities dealing with the matter and those players whose project was in question.
Perhaps the matter may still be rectified when the Member States have to ponder the practical application of the matter in more detail.
The explanation which I have given here is, in my opinion, important from the point of view of all parties who have anything to do with the directive.
Fortunately many other matters which are important from the point of view of the Aarhus convention have been received positively.
I have, first and foremost, wished to streamline practice by standardising the regulations concerning processing with regard to the various directives.
In this way, it will be easier for citizens to know how to proceed, and the obligation of authorities to advise citizens will be more straightforward.
In the Commission's proposal the modes of procedure vary slightly, and as a result it is difficult to know what one should do in any particular case.
In addition, I have incorporated into the report some objectives which are pursuant to the Aarhus convention, which the Commission had either omitted from its proposal or simply forgotten.
In this way the report complies better with the spirit and objectives of the convention.
In particular, this applies to Item 5 of Article 6, and Article 8, of the Aarhus Convention.
I would also like to thank the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Petitions for their opinions, which gave encouragement and support to my work in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Also, cooperation with the Commission and (in particular) the Council has been constructive, and bodes well for the second stage of processing of the report.
Mr President, we would like to thank Mrs Korhola for her work on this complex document.
In the Committee on Petitions we have a large number of petitions which relate to the particular directives concerned in this important report.
It is very clear to us that the public want to be involved, they want to be informed and they want information in good time about particular proposals.
We often hear complaints from the public about the lack of information, that it comes late, it is incomplete, it is difficult to understand.
We have often found through those petitions that there are a number of Member States that have very poorly applied the directives which are mentioned here and we have seen court cases resulting from that.
Our committee was extremely clear. We want the widest possible definition of "public".
We have found in the issues raised with us that it is not just environmental NGOs, or people living in an area that is directly affected.
We have come across small businesses, fishermen and others who have felt that particular schemes affect them and therefore they are interested parties.
We also thought it was important that the area of policy should be looked at as well, because one of the questions we often get is "what is the context of a particular development going ahead?", particularly where that is linked at times to European Union policy, such as CAP spending and spending on the Structural Funds.
We also find that people want access to resources in order to be able to understand the information they are given.
Sometimes we find complaints come to our committee effectively to have those environmental impact assessments assessed, because those organisations lack the resources to fully participate within the planning process and it is vital that we look at that, certainly at Member State level.
Mr President, full, effective participation by the public in the decision-making process in environmental matters is necessary and we support it.
It allows the citizens to express opinions and fears that may have a bearing on the decisions to be taken and allows those responsible for taking the decisions to take them into account.
This, in turn, increases accountability in the decision-making process and makes it more transparent, and helps to raise public awareness of environmental matters.
As has already been said, the importance of providing greater incentives for public participation has already been recognised at international level, with the Aarhus Convention.
The directive upon which we are going to vote tomorrow seeks to bring Community law into line with the provisions of this Convention and to smooth the way for its ratification by the Community.
The citizens will be able to participate fully right from the initial stages of the decision-making process, especially as regards the development of plans and programmes, the environmental impact assessment process and the prevention and overall reduction of pollution.
In this regard, I welcome the introduction by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy of fresh provisions, which refer clearly to the dissemination of information through the Internet as well.
A crucial element is that only the public concerned, citizens or groups, including NGOs, are entitled to express comments and opinions or even to appeal before a judicial body.
While I welcome other amendments made to the text by the rapporteur, I cannot support her proposal to extend this right to the participation of all citizens, without restriction.
A wider, less clear definition of citizens could lead to ambiguous interpretations and inappropriately hamper a project' s implementation.
However, I support the definitions included in the Commission' s proposal, which clearly define the concept of the public concerned, which alone is entitled to express comments and opinions to the competent authority before a decision is taken within the areas covered by the directive and, where appropriate, to appeal.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as far back as a few months ago, we debated an absolutely excellent report by Mrs Korhola concerning access by the general public to environmental information.
This time, we are debating public participation in drawing up environmental plans and programmes.
What these reports have in common is that the Commission' s proposals are based on what is known as the Aarhus Convention.
According to Article 8 of this Convention, every country must endeavour to promote a situation in which, at a time when it is still possible to influence the decisions, the general public is given an effective opportunity to participate in the public authorities' work on such rules.
According to Article 9 of the same Convention - and this is something I want to emphasise - each country undertakes, within the framework of its own national legislation, to give the public concerned the opportunity, through the courts, to have the validity of the authorities' decisions tested.
For me as a liberal, it is obvious that the decisions made and the proposals drafted by the public authorities must, as far as possible, be made accessible to anyone interested and affected.
Anything else would be unthinkable in a democracy.
May I congratulate the rapporteur on this important report - a crucial element of which is the definition of participation, ensuring that people can influence plans and programmes at different stages of the process and receive proper feedback so that they know that the issues they have raised have been dealt with seriously.
It is essential that consultation is not restricted in a way that in practice would make it meaningless - in other words, that authorities themselves could define the people who would be affected and they would be the only ones consulted.
I have a case in Swansea in my own constituency where a local authority is building an incinerator on the border of two counties and has consulted its own constituents, but not the people of the other county who live closer to it and who will be more affected and are now protesting vigorously against the plans.
This legislation could prevent that kind of situation arising.
Just as important it gives the public access to a review procedure, and so I ask for support for the amendments of my group which seek to strengthen the report in line with the Aarhus Convention.
Mr President, to advocate transparency and public participation in drawing up environmental plans and programmes is a laudable objective, which we fully agree with. However, the report gives rise to some fundamental problems.
First of all, the possible overlapping of texts prescribing public participation and, in particular, the directives on environmental impact studies and on the prevention or reduction of pollution. Secondly, the ratification of the Aarhus Convention.
This convention has been signed by the Community and by all the Member States, but has only been ratified by Italy or Denmark: it is therefore not in force. This report must not be an opportunity for the Union to replace, by means of a directive, the desire of the Member States to be bound by an international convention.
Furthermore, to add environmental policies to the plans and programmes seems to me premature at this stage, given that the Aarhus Convention is yet to be ratified.
There is also the concept of 'public affected' , which we are in favour of so as not to widen the scope of the text in an unrestricted fashion.
Nevertheless, the two concepts of 'public' and 'public affected' should be able to coexist, and it should be for the Member States to decide on the most appropriate level of consultation.
In the case of cross-border projects, for example, it would be sensible to broaden the consultation to the public as a whole.
We will support Amendments Nos 30, 31 and 32.
Finally, like the Commission, we believe that we should lay down the minimum conditions required in order to guarantee effective participation by the public and leave it to the Member States to regulate the practical details in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
(PPE-DE).
(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the complaints most frequently voiced by the public concerns the very limited role they are given to play in representative democracy.
Our citizens complain that they are given the right to vote every now and then, but that they do not enjoy full rights of participation in the day-to-day activities of the institutions for which they vote: at European level, at national level, and at regional and local level.
It is precisely in the area of the environment that the dissatisfaction of communities has been most keenly felt. When they disagree, often rightly so, with a particular project, their only option is to express their anger on the streets or in the courts.
This indignation increases exponentially when many of these projects with unacceptable environmental impacts are funded under the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds.
It is, therefore very important that, as a follow-up to the Aarhus Convention, the Commission has produced legislation on public access to environmental information, on public participation in certain plans, programmes and policies and on public access to justice.
Greater public participation not only gives greater legitimacy to the decisions taken by our institutions; it can also improve their quality.
I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for the work she has done on this proposal for a directive on public participation in drafting environmental plans and programmes, especially for having sought, by means of various amendments, to extend citizens' rights and to eliminate some ambiguities.
There is nevertheless one subject on which I disagree with Mrs Korhola. Public consultation will only be feasible if the definition of 'the public' is not too vague.
I therefore prefer the Commission' s approach, which defines the public affected by a given project as the target of consultation and not the rapporteur' s choice of a broader and, therefore, vaguer definition of the public.
Mr President, I share the European Commission' s opinion that actual public participation in environmental decision-making is beneficial.
After all, the public is given the opportunity of expressing its opinion, along with any concerns it may have.
The decision-makers are given the chance to take these into account when taking decisions.
In short, public participation will contribute to the transparency of the decision-making process and the acceptance of the outcome, namely the plans and programmes.
However, broadening participation to include policy-making, as proposed by the rapporteur, is taking matters a step too far, since policy-making is not specific enough for public participation.
Also, 'policy-making' is not a category that falls within the scope of the present 'environmental impact assessment' directive.
The objective of the present directive is to render basic procedures concerning public participation consistent in all Member States and to ensure that they are carried out in the same way within the Community.
However, it is also a minimum obligation.
It will thus become apparent upon implementation that discrepancies between the Member States exist after all.
Mr President, as many speakers have already said, the intentions behind this report are extremely commendable, particularly the aim of making it possible for the citizens to have a say in the process of establishing environmental rules.
This point was discussed during the March plenary and it was already clear then that attitudes towards the methodologies and towards the influence of this participation too vary from North to South, so to speak.
Indeed, the northern countries have a different attitude towards this type of involvement, towards the idea of this type of participation from the countries of central and southern Europe.
The rapporteur, clearly inspired by the way things work in her country, which is possibly democratically more developed, more advanced than others - proposes participation that is too peremptory, too authoritarian, participation that could ultimately slow down, if not block or paralyse certain decision-making processes, upon which there will never be total convergence between the direct democratic base and what is known as the authority, that is the administration appointed to deal with these issues.
There you are: this authority must also take into clear consideration all the demands and comments of those who have to build, sell and create tourist, sporting and cultural concerns - in short, daily activities - in the environment.
Considering that this second debate contains points and issues which involve legality and access to levels of justice, including in the event of appeals, the roles and responsibilities must be quite clearly, fairly and unambiguously defined in terms of who the actors should be and how much influence they should have.
The Aarhus Convention has been cited: that is all very well - we support it - but it must not be taken as Gospel.
It too must allow for a healthy subsidiarity, for customs, for habits, and for the level of directly democratic involvement possible in the various countries.
In any case, I congratulate the rapporteur, who has put in an enormous amount of work, but I feel that there should be some adaptation, as I said at the beginning, to the different attitudes.
Mr President, may I begin by saying that this proposal deals with the second pillar of this convention involving public participation in environmental decision-taking.
In addition to this proposal on access to environmental information, there are other pieces of Community legislation which already incorporate the principle of the Aarhus Convention.
The Commission will ensure that the Aarhus elements are built into all future proposals.
Public participation has to become a fully integrated part of environmental decision-taking.
To reach that objective, our proposals have to be easy to put into practice, so that they may be smoothly implemented in the different administrative systems of the Member States.
The question whether participation in decision-taking should aim at the public at large or the "public concerned" is a key point, and it has been addressed by a number of Members who have just spoken.
In accordance with the Aarhus Convention, the Commission proposes to ensure that the public at large is fully informed about planned developments which might affect them, whilst giving the right to participate in the decision-taking process to those having an interest in or likely to be affected by the developments, that is, the "public concerned."
Some of the proposed amendments, and indeed what has been said by some Members just now, seems to imply that by using the definition, "the public concerned", both the convention and the Commission are deliberately restricting the rights of citizens, but may I be permitted to point out that is certainly not the case.
It is not correct.
This proposal is aimed at extending the rights of citizens.
There is no question of restricting those rights.
By defining the "public concerned", we are focusing the attention of the competent authorities on the need to take account of those citizens most directly affected.
The definition will confirm both the right to express a view and the right to be heard.
The definition of "public concerned" is sufficiently detailed to ensure that there is no doubt who should be involved.
Therefore members of the public could argue that they had been unjustifiably excluded.
That would be difficult with a more general definition of the public.
The inclusion of NGOs within the definition of the "public concerned" will ensure that a more general public view may be taken into account.
On a more practical level, the definition of "public concerned" has been used without major problems in existing legislation - for example the environmental impact assessment directive - for a number years.
There have been no problems raised as a result of people having been excluded by the use of the definition - at least no major problems.
In short, this approach will give those affected by new developments the right to influence decisions which will not just affect their environment but which may also affect their economic and social conditions.
For those reasons, the Commission, regrettably, cannot support the amendments seeking to replace the concept of the "public concerned".
Amendment No 26 seeks to extend considerably the scope of Article 1, so as to cover plans and programmes not only in the environmental field but also in other sectors.
The Commission's view is that this would make the scope of the proposal less well-defined and also that the measures proposed would lead to legal confusion.
There would in effect be a duplication of measures in different pieces of legislation each seeking to do the same thing, but in an inconsistent manner.
In particular, for plans and programmes in other sectors that may have significant environmental effects, Directive 2001/42 on strategic environmental assessment already incorporates measures of particular relevance.
The directive provides for environmental assessment of relevant plans and programmes in many integration sectors and envisages public participation fully in line with the Aarhus requirements.
Amendments Nos 6 and 12 aim to give effect to a best endeavour clause under the Aarhus Convention and are formulated in a non-binding way.
Amendment No 9 introduces public participation concerning policies in its heading, but the text does not contain operational provisions in this respect.
In formulating the proposal, the Commission's objective has been to incorporate the binding provisions of the Aarhus Convention.
The Commission's view is that there would be no added value in taking up its soft-law provisions.
Not only the Community but all Member States have signed the Aarhus Convention and so already have to take into account the soft-law provisions.
The Commission, regrettably, cannot accept Amendments Nos 7 and 11 which provide for access to justice concerning public participation in plans and programmes.
The Aarhus Convention does not explicitly require this, neither does the directive on strategic environmental assessment of plans and programmes provide for access to justice.
The Commission is however considering possible further legislative proposals in relation to the third Aarhus pillar on access to justice.
In conclusion, may I now confirm the Commission's position on the amendments. The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 15, 18, 25, 28 and 29.
In addition, Amendments Nos 9, 13, 14, 23 and 27 can be accepted in part and Amendments Nos 4, 5, 10 and 17 in principle.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 16, 20, 21 and 22.
By way of conclusion, I should like to emphasise that it is in our common interest, which is the interest of the European citizen after all, to have this proposal enter into force swiftly.
Only once the frameworks are established can public participation in decision-making become a fully integrated administrative practice.
The English interpretation was not able to follow my speech and thus all the other languages based on that interpretation were incomplete.
I regret this.
It has happened many times so I urge you to see that the quality of interpretation is improved as soon as possible.
Thank you, Mrs Korhola, we have taken note.
We know that our relay interpreting system causes problems now and again.
We have taken very good note and this should not happen again.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS)
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0324/2001) by Mr Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending:
I. Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities (UCITS) with a view to regulating management companies and simplified prospectuses [7551/1/2001 - C5-0296/2001 - 1998/0243(COD)]
II. Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities (UCITS) [7550/1/2001 - C5-0295/2001 - 1998/0242(COD)]
Mr President, let this be the end of twelve years' debate of the 'UCITS Directive' !
In February of last year, we had the first reading.
One and a half years' later, in July, the common position was finally adopted, and now it is our turn.
As you know, the first proposal concerns the UCITS itself and what investments it may engage in. The second updates and extends the rules relating to the actual management of the funds.
Both proposals were broadly supported by Parliament at first reading.
A total of 37 amendments were adopted for the two proposals. Of these, 30 have been accepted in full or in part by the Council.
As for UCITS-1, the Council wholly or partially approved 20 of Parliament' s 24 amendments. Moreover, it has made a number of changes of its own.
The most important concerns OTC derivatives, the use of which the Commission opposed from the start.
However, Parliament considered that OTC derivatives could be employed more broadly, but according to stringent criteria. The Council adopted the same policy.
In several cases, the Council adopted a still more prudent approach than Parliament on the issue of OTC derivatives and considered that investments in these had to fulfil more stringent qualitative criteria.
Where comitology is concerned, the common position does include comitology provisions in the field of financial services. I nonetheless want to stress that there is no obvious link to the subsequent proposals made by the group chaired by Mr Lamfalussy.
The 1985 directive created the so-called UCITS Contact Committee which was set up to advise the Commission.
The extension of the Contact Committee' s powers to include new powers was foreseen in the original proposal.
Parliament accepts parts of the proposal, but not the part concerning the adjustment of limit values, as adopted by the Council.
In the same way, both the Commission and the Council accepted Parliament' s request to limit the scope of the delegation to the Committee.
In my view, Parliament has thus agreed to the use of comitology and, moreover, successfully amended the scope of its powers.
I do not therefore see any reason to re-open this issue at this juncture.
There is nonetheless an amendment from Mr Goebbels, Mr Jonckheer and Mr Herzog.
Should it be adopted, I am afraid that we should be facing conciliation and not knowing where it might end.
The Lamfalussy agreement is in danger of being delayed and the UCITS directive of being halted in its tracks. That is something that no one can want to see happen.
I hope that Mr Goebbels is able to share my view.
Turning to UCITS-2, the Council has, for the most part, accepted the concerns expressed by Parliament at first reading. Ten out of Parliament' s 13 amendments have been incorporated in part or in full.
The most contentious issue was that of the capital requirement for management companies.
The compromise finally reached by the Council is, broadly speaking, in line with Parliament' s stance.
Given how complicated these two directives are and how quickly the market is developing, the committee proposes a review of the rules within the next three years. There are two reasons for this.
First of all, the compromise reached in Council is a very fragile one, and it would not serve anybody' s interests to open the Pandora' s box of detailed, technical or politically sensitive amendments.
A conciliation would delay this review, for which there is already a need, and it might also stop the legislation from ever seeing the light of day.
Secondly, the two common positions strike a good balance between investor protection and investment freedom. As I say, the majority of those changes we proposed last time have been introduced.
There are nonetheless certain unresolved issues. In my opinion, these are better tackled in a wider context.
The committee was kind enough to follow my recommendations.
There is therefore only one amendment to UCITS-1, setting out some guidelines for a future review process.
A 'grandfather' clause is also proposed, whereby existing funds should not have to comply with the new legislation for a transitional period.
There is also an amendment to UCITS-2, seeking to align the review period for the capital requirement with the general review.
Following the committee' s reading, I have been in contact with the Council, as recently as a few hours ago, and also with the Commission.
Together with Mr Goebbels, I am therefore tabling a new amendment to reduce the transitional period.
In this way, it will be possible to introduce the UCITS directive into the Member States by 2005, that is to say the year in which the financial action plan is to be implemented. The purpose of this is to avoid conciliation.
The work on renewing the regulations governing UCITS has been going on for as long as twelve years and is a clear example of why decision-making within this area needs to be reformed.
If Europe is to have a chance of competing with, for example, the American economy, it will have to be possible for changes of a more technical nature to take place significantly more simply and quickly.
There is now a good balance between a well-functioning market and reasonably secure protection for consumers.
Parliament has been proactive and shown an ability to act quickly and to compromise when it really counts.
May we continue along that route!
Well thought-out, prompt and effective legislation - that is what Europe needs.
I want to end by thanking everyone involved: the Commissioner, his efficient and friendly colleagues and my fellow MEPs who have all really shown willing during this difficult period.
I hope that, tomorrow, we can thus draw a line under twelve years' work for the benefit of Europe' s consumers and investors.
Mr President, to tie in with the rapporteur' s closing words, I wish to thank everyone who has taken part and especially the Commission staff for their help.
The issue of concern to us, however technical it is, is of extraordinary political and social importance because it is widely known that undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), including pension funds, are currently the preferred form of saving for the majority of European citizens.
The first problem we came up against was that there were two directives: one called a 'product' directive, which allowed these bodies to invest in products from which they were hitherto denied access, and another, which proposed substantially increasing capital requirements.
Both the Commission and Parliament were tempted to immediately adopt the so-called 'product' directive and delay the adoption of the so-called 'management' directive.
This Parliament warned that it was dangerous to allow these undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities - which, I repeat monopolise the market in public savings - to move into deeper waters without any guarantee that their ships were prepared for what would be a more daring day' s sailing than they had hitherto embarked on.
As the rapporteur indicated, the purpose of the first discussion - and I am limiting myself here to the product directive - was to decide what they could invest in.
He referred to non-standardised derivatives, index funds, the cascade effect, etc., which are technical issues that I will not go into now.
What I do want to say is that, in my group' s opinion, a balance has been achieved between giving greater opportunities to management bodies and, therefore, greater opportunities to investors and the protection, the caution, that must be present in any discussion of such delicate matters.
Parliament wanted to send a message to the Commission.
As on previous occasions, Parliament wants to be flexible on the adoption of the directives of the financial services action plan.
We want this directive to be adopted rapidly and we do not, therefore, want to have to go to conciliation.
We have therefore, limited our amendments to one - which I personally am not in favour of, although I will be voting for it - which consists of creating a 'grandfather' clause, in other words, creating a transitional period so that currently existing bodies have additional time in which to raise their capital.
Mention has been made of another amendment by Mr Goebbels, which he is going to withdraw, but I think it is extraordinarily intelligent and is the second message that Parliament is sending to the Commission.
The first, I repeat, is not tabling amendments that cannot be accepted by the Council and the Commission.
The second, even though we are not involved in a Lamfalussy procedure, is to warn that we will always have to be flexible.
We will always show willingness to be flexible on the legislative procedure, but we are not prepared to concede the codecision powers that Parliament has taken such a long time to gain.
Mr President, I will try to make up for the time which Mr García-Margallo has used.
I would simply like, on behalf of my group, to express our support for the proposals of Mr Olle Schmidt, and I congratulate him on his arduous work as rapporteur for the European Parliament.
We support the two amendments he has tabled.
I have personally, along with some other fellow Members, tabled another amendment.
We are, in all likelihood, going to withdraw that agreement, depending on the replies which Commissioner Bolkestein is soon to give us.
We believe - and there are many of us; I believe I can speak for Mr García-Margallo and others - that the balance between the Council and the European Parliament as co-legislators was upset at Stockholm.
The Commission must re-establish that balance. We await concrete proposals from the Commissioner.
I just wish to say on behalf of the Liberal Group that I very much hope Mr Goebbels and his colleagues will withdraw their amendment.
We do not believe that the amendment insisting on call-back is appropriate to this particular piece of legislation, which my colleague Olle Schmidt has described as being very carefully balanced after the common position of the Council.
Nor is it appropriate in the context of the ongoing discussions over Lamfalussy.
Indeed, I would go as far to say that by insisting on call-back, which was not a phrase which appeared in Parliament's second resolution on this subject after the Stockholm Council, we risk calling into question our bona fides in the lengthy negotiations which some of us have undertaken with Mr Bolkestein.
I very much hope, therefore, that the people who have put forward this amendment will withdraw it, and that discussions will take place in an appropriate place.
We should not try to call into question this piece of legislation.
I believe it should be put through as is.
I too very much hope that Mr Goebbels is going to withdraw Amendment No 4.
You want call-back, Mr Goebbels, I want call-back and so does Mr Bolkestein.
The fact remains that it is not feasible to have a legal call-back within the terms of the Treaty.
Therefore, it is up to us to find a political agreement and a form of words which will do until 2004 when we can review this whole issue.
Indeed I believe the Commission is committed to such a review.
It is vitally important that we come to this agreement.
On Mr Schmidt's report, it is excellent to see the modernisation of the framework for UCITS by the inclusion of derivatives and OTC derivatives.
Parliament is leading the way on this, and Mr Schmidt has played a particularly successful role in updating the directives in this way and very much led the way on the derivatives issue.
I am sorry to see the capital requirements in the form that they are.
I believe that UCITS managers should be subject to capital requirements, but I do not believe those contained in the directive are sufficiently risk-sensitive.
I do not believe that they are consistent with the general framework that we hope to implement.
I do not think that assessing capital according to risk under management actually reflects the risk undertaken.
I am also concerned that this formulation of the directive will produce an uneven market opening, leaving the market closed in one Member State and open in the other 14.
But I have been persuaded by the rapporteur and our esteemed shadow rapporteur not to table amendments on these defects because we are very keen to get these two directives on the statute book to modernise the framework for a unit trust and UCITS in the European Union.
I commend the directive to the House.
Mr President, I refer to the common position on Directive 1998/242 and the capital requirements that it will impose on investment management firms.
In Scotland, there is a long tradition of investment management going back to the opening of the American west in the 19th century.
These investment managers were usually law firms, private partnerships, which managed the assets of their clients very successfully.
To this day, there are investment firms of this type, private partnerships, sole proprietorships and other structures with limited capital.
The interests of clients are fully safeguarded as their assets are held by independent and fully capitalised and regulated depositories.
It is largely irrelevant to set capital requirements on the investment management firms themselves.
I am relieved that the Council has reduced slightly the capital requirements set by this Parliament at first reading and has set a top limit of EUR 10 million.
But this is still substantial for private partnerships and sole proprietorships.
Incidentally, the largest and most successful firms in America and in the world - Fidelity is a good example - are exactly of this type.
The requirements of this type will be a hurdle for new enterprising entrants into an industry which requires a regular injection of new blood.
At the very least, it should provide for this capital to be available by means of guarantees from banks or by insurance policies to cover professional and operational risk.
But the common position, for some not very apparent reason, restricts such cover to only 50% of the requirement.
Why?
The common position provides for the Commission to report on this matter within five years of entry into force of the directive.
I should like to put on record now the request that such a report should specifically consider whether any capital requirement at all is necessary for investment management companies, and certainly that it should be greatly reduced.
Mr President, while, in many areas, the European legislation which we produce here is often openly criticised - quite rightly - we should recognise that the 1985 directive on undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities was, for once, a masterpiece.
The success it has had in the investment fund sector and with the clients of these funds bears witness to this.
It has also become an example for legislation on a world scale.
Since it entered into force in 1989, not only have the assets of the UCITSs increased dramatically, but also cross-border trade has developed very strongly.
It has therefore achieved the objectives it was intended for.
However, if, after ten years, this directive needs a 'facelift' in order to adapt to the evolution of the markets, to the increasingly sophisticated financial products available, I remain concerned about the fate of the older funds, which do not meet the new demands.
That is why I had advocated a clause for these funds, a so-called 'grandfather' clause, which would be unrestricted.
Also in this field there are acquired rights, which it would be unfair to modify in a backdated fashion.
If there is no such clause, there will be a significant risk of market insecurity, which would have disastrous effects on the performance of the funds, prejudicing not only the industry but also the investors.
And above all, the weaker consumers, who do not keep so up-to-date with financial matters and who therefore react more slowly to them, will be the most affected.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has finally expressed its preference for a clause which is restricted in time.
This is the lesser evil, even if this clause may have negative effects, in terms of competition, for the older UCITSs, all of which will probably not be able to adapt to the new provisions of the directive in the best operational and financial conditions.
Mr President, I therefore hope that the House will vote in favour of this restricted clause.
Please allow me to point out that I am also opposed to the amendment by Mr Goebbels, which would have the effect of delaying, indeed sacrificing, the modified directive, which we are able to live with, despite its shortcomings - but it would appear to be a lost cause from the outset.
Mr Goebbels would do well, I believe, to withdraw his amendment.
He can put it in cold storage until there is a better occasion to table it once again.
I should like to begin by saying that the Commission would firstly like to thank very much the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt.
On behalf of my staff - about whom Mr Schmidt had some extremely kind words to say - I thank the rapporteur, and the Members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their extremely constructive approach on these important files.
The common positions are crucial elements for delivering the FSAP - the financial services action plan - on time, in other words, by the year 2003 for an integrated European Union for securities markets and 2005 overall.
These proposals, taken as a whole, represent a highly delicate and complex compromise which the Commission fully supports, as does European industry.
That is an important fact to bear in mind.
Given the capitalisation of the UCITS market - nearly EUR 4 trillion - the expected benefits to be had are large.
Firstly, the proposals will widen the set of financial instruments eligible to be used in UCITS portfolios while enhancing risk management requirements.
Thus they will provide greater financial diversity while keeping the original concept, namely risk diversification with the highest standards of investor protection.
Secondly, the management companies which generally run these savings schemes will enjoy a European passport and will be allowed to provide additional services to customers who request, for example, individual management of their assets.
But they will have to comply with a comprehensive set of requirements and rules.
Thirdly, investor information will be strongly improved by detailed disclosure of risk profiles, along with a fully harmonised, simplified prospectus to play the role of a single, investor-friendly pan-European marketing tool.
Now I come to the amendments tabled.
I should like to stress that the provisions contained in the first three amendments, namely the twin review clauses and the grandfathering clause, pose some difficulties for us - not because of the substance, but with the timetables proposed in each case.
We would much prefer a single deadline for both, that is, 2005 - the date of the conclusion of the financial services action plan, which we think would be more logical.
However, in a spirit of compromise and because we must now lay this matter to rest after twelve years of discussion, and in recognition of the efforts this Parliament has undertaken, also considering the last amendment of the rapporteur with would shorten the grandfathering period foreseen in Amendment No 1, the Commission will, in the end, support Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3.
I now turn to Amendment No 4, which would introduce a so-called "call-back" clause regarding the UCITS Contact Committee.
I should like to be clear that this is not acceptable to the Commission.
We believe that it would not be acceptable for the Council either.
It is not acceptable to the Commission because firstly, the clause which has been tabled is not compatible with Article 202 of the Treaty, as Mr Goebbels knows full well.
It is also in contradiction with existing comitology rules.
Of that, Mr Goebbels is also aware.
(Interruption from Mr Goebbels) Not before 2004, Mr Goebbels, as I have explained on behalf of the Commission many, many times.
The second reason why this amendment is not acceptable to the Commission is that the UCITS Contact Committee's mandate was discussed by Parliament at first reading.
Parliament then gave its full support to the mandate of the UCITS Contact Committee.
Indeed, the first common position fully incorporated what this Parliament wanted.
So I suggest that Mr Goebbels does not back-track on what Parliament has previously agreed.
The third reason why that amendment is unacceptable to the Commission is that accepting it would lead to an institutional dispute in conciliation and seriously put at risk the adoption of both directives.
That is the last thing the Commission and - I assume - this Parliament would want.
So let us agree on Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3.
In particular, I would address the following words to Mr Purvis, who referred to the United States' system, which is different from the European system.
Depositing is fundamental for the European system.
We are going to consider updating, following the Ecofin Council of December that the European form of UCITS need capital because they cannot assume debts in order to provide themselves with working capital.
That is possible in the United States.
Therefore the need to provide such undertakings in the United States with capital is less than in Europe.
Once again, the European undertakings cannot use debts for their working capital and therefore must provide themselves with capital.
I believe the vote will be taken tomorrow and I hope we can now agree to Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3 and to the proposals as such.
This would allow us to move ahead constructively for the sake of European investors, European industry and the European economy.
I hope that after twelve years of discussions these proposals can now find their way to the statute book.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
International monetary system
The next item on the agenda is the report (A5-0302/2001) by Mr Goebbels on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the international monetary system.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, according to the International Monetary Fund, the world experienced 120 monetary crises between 1975 and 2000.
A monetary crisis is defined as the depreciation of a currency by more than 25% in one year.
It was always the real economy that paid the price for this financial instability.
Less growth, less employment and more misery accompany financial crises.
We should therefore view the need for financial stability as being in the public good.
Public authorities are called upon to prevent, or otherwise to manage as best they can, any crisis.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has commissioned me to produce this own-initiative report.
I have experienced some difficulties with the rules laid down by the Bureau of our Parliament.
My report was too long, as if it was possible to deal with the complexity of international monetary relations in five pages.
The Meltzer report, in the American Congress, was some one hundred pages long.
The Meltzer committee, made up of congressmen, scientists, bankers and trade unionists inspired a lively international debate.
My humble report, and the motion for a resolution, will certainly not inspire a similar debate.
In order to carry more weight, our Parliament should have followed a procedure similar to that of the American Congress, that is, by means of a collective report, with detailed proposals.
The motion for a resolution is restricted to certain essential issues.
My report hinges on the notions of transparency and accountability, regulation and solidarity.
In 2000, the private sector transferred about twenty times more resources to the developing countries than the World Bank and the other multilateral banks.
Open financial markets will lead to significant increases in efficiency for world exchanges so long as they are provided with a better framework.
The international financial institutions must become truly universal.
The monetary fund must become more democratic.
The super majority of 95% must be abolished for all important decisions.
It gives a right of veto to the United States and to the Union, if it is also able to unite within the International Monetary Fund.
A regular rise in quotas and the issuing of special drawing rights is needed, in accordance with the growth of the world economy.
Common rules and standards should be applied on an international level.
We need a legal and judicial framework allowing for the rapid resolution of insolvency crises.
The private sector should be involved in the management of crises, in particular by means of the general application of collective action clauses.
This involvement should extend to the freezing of debt service payments. This will allow a reduction in moral uncertainties and in the cost of restructuring programmes.
Better prevention of crises requires increased supervision of off-balance sheet operations.
In particular, we must toughen the prudential requirements imposed on banks when they serve to offset hedge funds.
Europe must become more active in international bodies.
In this respect, the ECB must be more involved.
The European system of central banks must be designed as a body for coordinating the Union' s supervision and control authorities.
One of the conclusions of my report is that the Tobin tax will not work.
In fact it would have terrible economic consequences.
Why penalise transactions between strong currencies, which make up more than 95% of international currency transactions, on the basis of a desire to prevent speculation against the currencies of developing countries.
The Chilean encaja would achieve better results.
Nevertheless, I welcome the decision of the ECOFIN Council to invite the Commission to prepare a report on this issue which I hope will make the decision much more objective.
My report puts great stress on the need to settle the problem of third-world debt as soon as possible.
This debt should be partly cancelled and partly rescheduled, so as to allow the developing countries to repay the amounts up to a limit of 5% of their annual exports.
The London Agreement of 1953 laid down such provisions in favour of Germany. This was the basis of the German post-war economic miracle.
This could also be the basis for a new economic partnership between all nations, the beginning of a true globalisation.
Settling the problem of third-world debt would allow the internal development of these countries and would cement the victory against poverty and ignorance and therefore against intolerance and terrorism.
Mr President, one could, with reference to Mr Goebbels' report, say that it was worth it in the end.
It is an own-initiative report dating back as far as 1999, when it was prompted by the crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil.
In the meantime, there has been a succession of further small crises, and we have got on with our work.
In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, our group wholeheartedly agreed with the basic line taken by the rapporteur, not least because you, Mr Goebbels, took up a clear position on the Tobin tax.
The international monetary system is undergoing transformation, as is clear from your report.
We want to bring proposals into this process of transformation, but we can also see that the euro has firmly established itself since 1999 and has fully proved itself as an anchor giving stability to the global economy.
That in itself is an important contribution by Europe to stabilising the international monetary system.
Mr Goebbels has done a sound job of work, something I want to emphasise here today.
For that reason, we are in substantial agreement with his proposals: the improved supervision of banking, surveillance of international financial activities, greater powers for international bodies such as the IMF and the World Bank to really get to grips with crisis situations.
As you have just said, the IMF must become more democratic.
Above all else, it must fit into the overall scheme of things so that it does not become the bogeyman of crisis management.
Of course, the states must work together in this, for financial means alone will not overcome crises.
We agree with closer collaboration at international level between national supervisory and regulatory authorities, a stronger coordinating role for the European Central Bank, something that has still not been resolved, and which we would remind you is overdue - the establishment of an observatory for systemic risks at the Bank for International Cooperation, and continued efforts at reform of the international monetary system.
We share Mr Goebbels' view - contested in their proposals by our Green colleagues - that the Tobin tax does not belong in this report.
Looking through the proposals, I noted that the Group of the Party of European Socialists also, according to Amendment No 10, wants this to be checked up on, even though it does refer to an ECOFIN Council resolution.
On that point we take a completely different view.
We agree with your basic approach and we will be asking for a separate vote on this subject.
Introducing such a tax, whose technical problems cannot in any case be resolved, would imperil the transfer of capital and thus also put at risk the advantages of global division of labour, investment and employment.
That is why we are opposed to it, but will vote for your report without a Tobin tax, and against it with one.
Mr President, thank you for your willingness to allow us this pleasure late in the evening.
On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report.
We support this report because it gives the right solutions to the issues of the new financial architecture which must be created, of reform as a whole and of crisis management - solutions which also deal practically with the needs of regions hit by crises, the requirements of international financial markets and the very important need of all societies for stability in financial markets.
I would like to emphasise again that I believe stability in financial markets to be a public good to which all citizens are entitled.
Taking a look at the situation we are in, I cannot resist making an observation.
International financial activity on the currency markets has, in fact, decreased to around USD 1 200 billion a day, and that is due to the creation of the monetary union, which is of course one of the levers of the flows of capital that are quantitatively scarcely manageable.
At the same time, though, we must note that during the course of the nineties we were dealing with a twenty-five-fold turnover increase in derivative trading such as swaps, options and so on.
We know that, now, not even 3% of the transactions have to do with the real market in goods and services.
I believe it to be important that we should look at the flow of capital under the influence of globalisation in terms both, on the one hand, of the yield accruing to institutional investors and of the economic and social situation, and on the other, from the point of view of the capital-importing countries.
In this connection, we have to bear in mind that 75% of the capital invested flows into only twelve states, and that only 1% of the capital invested flows to black Africa.
The rapporteur is right to demand that we now move to a consolidation, and that can only be done if we write off debt more comprehensively than we have done before.
Functioning globalised financial markets are no doubt advantageous.
Presupposing stable development, they contribute to growth and employment.
Despite that, there are still economic and social deficits and a lack of regulation and supervision.
The report points that out.
Concern about speculative commitments to the detriment of the real economy and the excessive volatility of the market brought about by an enormous increase in transaction volume for certain financial products are factors which make a reform of the international financial architecture more necessary than ever.
We have lived through 120 currency crises, and they cannot be abolished.
We have not yet succeeded in developing a working system of early warning indicators, in making information transparent and in drawing up a code of conduct that works for everyone, and we have not yet solved the problem of moral hazard.
So I consider it very important that this report's demands should influence the EU's negotiations, and the EU, too, must speak with one voice at the international level.
It is not just about us having a monetary zone, but we must also speak with one voice internationally on financial market policy and on issues of the world's financial architecture.
The introduction of the euro is a contribution to financial stability, and our financial system is better protected against external shocks, but we must move on, for the monetary union is only one contribution to stability in Europe and the world.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report.
We, in the Liberal Group, welcome the thrust of the report, because it grapples with the real issues and it avoids the sort of populist solutions which, I am afraid, are on offer in many of the amendments before this House.
I am particularly thinking of the Tobin tax.
It is, of course, the case that nobody, particularly liberals in favour of free inquiry, could object to the Commission's study on this subject.
But I frankly believe that this is a false promise which really offers very little practical benefit to the countries that we are all, I hope, trying to help.
Instead, the report quite correctly identifies as a potential model, the Chilean deposit system, which introduces an incentive for investors to invest long-term in an emerging market rather than going for short term paper because that involves a longer-term investment for depositors.
That is the right way to go, and therefore I very much congratulate the rapporteur and hope that we will not support the amendments to an excellent report.
Mr President, despite the flashy title of this report - 'How the international monetary system can be made to work better' - these insipid formulae are certainly not going to prevent future crises.
The only purpose of this report is to justify an economic system which is irrational, anarchic and socially unjust.
You, the defenders of capitalism, are totally incapable of regulating this economy which is based on the quest for profit and competition.
Because it cannot be regulated.
The only imaginable regulation is that which the most powerful impose on others, but they do so to their own benefit.
The desire to democratise the IMF, which is controlled by the United States, is also ridiculous.
The rapporteur recognises that the risk of financial instability is inherent to the operation of the economy.
This is undoubtedly the case for your capitalist economy, but the seizure of social wealth and the means of production by a limited number of financial and industrial groups, their rivalry and their speculation, will come to an end.
For future generations, the immense wastage and patent stupidity of your economy will serve as a demonstration that, in relation to the control of its collective life, humanity had not yet moved beyond barbarism.
Mr President, the rapporteur deserves support in his endeavours to achieve greater financial stability.
He is right to call for tighter supervision, although that does not rule out a crisis.
Interestingly, the strategy of the International Monetary Fund has shifted towards more focused support.
This role of catalyst in stages of growth can preclude negative effects of the policy, such as an increase in the burden of debt for up-and-coming countries.
The rapporteur' s request to coordinate a number of matters at European level is understandable.
If these do not follow naturally on from global policies, Europe' s own policy would undermine the strength of the system as a whole.
Finally, I cannot see a role for the European Central Bank in global crisis prevention.
Only a few months ago, the ECB was asked to absorb the slow-down in growth, although there was no reason to reduce interest rates within Europe.
Striking a compromise between European policy and global requirements does not seem to be benefiting international stability.
Mr President, the large number of monetary crises and the negative consequences they have for the global economy as a whole require joint action.
There are many who believe that the introduction of a tax on global financial transactions could prevent future financial crises.
Personally, I am glad that this opinion is not held by many in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I do not believe that introduction of the Tobin tax could prevent financial crises.
Let capital make its way to where it is of the greatest use, in other words, let it be invested in new markets, developing countries and so on.
By that means, growth can be produced.
If we now make the transfer of capital expensive and limit and regulate it, the effect would only be counter-productive.
Introducing it would also make sense only if it could be done internationally and without loopholes.
This seems impossible, so that this tax will result only in additional burdens, bureaucracy and so forth, without the actual objective - the limitation of financial crises - being able to be achieved.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to the rapporteur.
That has already been said.
There are four areas I would like to touch on briefly.
First, we want to make the international monetary system more stable, because financial stability is, among other things, a public good and a basic economic precondition for growth, employment and social justice - that is to say, a moral duty.
Second, we demand not simply a reform of the IMF, we require of the public authorities the moral obligation to create optimum balance between the free play of markets and the need for them to be regulated in accordance with the fundamental principle of the eco-social market economy, and to guarantee a balance between the public and private sectors in public rescue measures in times of crisis.
We demand of the Member States economic policies geared to growth and employment, and we demand the cancellation of debt, subject to appropriate economic and political conditions.
Third, we begin at home.
The euro is a stability currency even in the eyes of the world.
The response of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank after 11 September was one of stability in the face of the crisis.
The Stability and Growth Pact is a European response.
The Commission and the European Parliament have, by a majority, expressed their opposition to the Tobin tax, and the Liège resolutions include measures as correctives to globalisation.
Fourth, we oppose measures to slow down economic development and ideologically motivated attempts to undo the Stability and Growth Pact or introduce the Tobin tax on its own, which create insecurity among those who work in the market.
So I also regret that the Social Democrats' Amendment No 10 reinterprets the actual Liège resolution by inserting the Tobin tax.
Remove this reinterpretation; in Liège we find ourselves.
Mr President, I was astonished to read the briefing by Parliament' s Information Office, which presented the Goebbels report as follows: 'In a resolution on the operation of the International Monetary System, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is critical of the introduction of a Tobin tax on financial speculations' .
This appears to be the headline which is supposed to attract the press, and this still appears to be the subject around which the debates here revolve.
In my opinion, this does not at all do justice to the balanced and excellent report by Mr Goebbels.
To start with, the resolution does not in any way speak in favour of, or against, the Tobin tax.
The extensive explanatory statement does contain a few observations, but what is more important is that it also contains many other alternatives in order to achieve the two objectives pursued by those in favour of the Tobin tax.
Capital movements and foreign exchange markets must be founded more on actual economic reality and must be directed towards long-term investments and financial stability by taking a number of measures, but also by adopting a more flexible stance with regard to developing countries.
Their debts should be cancelled and they must be granted an appropriate way of refinancing in order to be given a new lease of life.
Actually, one could say that, in fact, this report fits in perfectly with the Tobin tax action points.
It would be unfortunate if the report were seen as an opposing force, for I believe that it complements the Tobin tax well.
In an amendment tabled by my group, a proposal has been formulated in an entirely neutral way that was also formulated in the ECOFIN Council.
This amendment warmly welcomes the proposal by the ECOFIN Council to carry out such a study and further analysis.
That seems to be far more fruitful than another instance of polarisation concerning the method: yes or no to the Tobin tax.
In this way, those in favour of the Tobin tax can again endorse the objectives which are now actually on the agenda, and those against can be pleased about the fact that research can be carried out in a neutral way and that the objectives, namely, better management of capital movements and more opportunities for developing countries, can be achieved.
Mr President, first of all, I wish to congratulate Mr Goebbels on his report.
This is an interesting report that goes into considerable depth in an attempt to explore the various issues it raises and its resolution is informed and balanced.
In our opinion, the report makes a constructive contribution to a debate of fundamental political importance and, furthermore, is very timely.
The debate on how to create a better-working international monetary and financial system lies at the heart of our task of responding to globalisation.
Private capital flows - and the report also takes this view - are the main source of growth, prosperity and productivity.
If our objective is to ensure that countries, both developed and developing, are able to take full advantage of the benefits of globalisation, the best option that I can picture is for financial markets and their operations to merge.
Broad-based, deep-rooted and fluid financial markets will make funding investment easier, which will, in turn, enable economic operators to spread their risks more effectively.
This situation will prove beneficial for those operations that would otherwise be too risky for international investors, which will be of benefit not only to developing countries, but also to small and medium-sized businesses in our own countries.
The economic benefits generated by the globalisation of finance are the result of the links between markets and operators having become stronger.
Because of the nature of these links, the upsets passed on within a modern economy as a consequence of this process of globalisation are more rapid, for the very reason that borders that existed twenty years ago have disappeared.
It is true that amongst the risks we will have to face, there will be financial markets with excessively volatile exchange rates and share prices.
A 'contagious' effect can occur between one country and others and it is possible that capital flows will fluctuate.
Within the Economic and Monetary Union we have stimulated stability and growth by means of macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, which are fundamental factors for strengthening our economy and for preventing - or rather, fighting against - these financial upsets.
Economic and Monetary Union, therefore, contributes to improving the stability of the international situation in our region.
It is also true, however, that various alternatives have been put forward across the world.
I agree with the thesis of Mr Goebbels' s report.
There are no panaceas that will help us confront the challenge of consolidating the global financial system.
The report makes this point very clear and I hope that its resolution will be read not only by those for whom this document is officially intended and who have a professional interest in these matters. I hope that it is also read by the people who are - legitimately - concerned at the direction in which the process of international economic and financial integration is heading.
The problems and challenges inherent in the integration of financial markets must be addressed in a broader context, which is what Mr Goebbels has sought to achieve in his report and what we in the Commission are seeking to achieve in the study that the Liège Ecofin meeting asked us to produce on how we can respond to the challenges of globalisation, which we are intending to present next February.
What has been happening in recent years?
I would say that since the crises in Asia, we have made substantial progress.
Efforts have been made to improve macroeconomic conditions, economies are today more resistant to external shocks and the number of countries choosing to abide by internationally agreed codes and standards in order to make their economies more transparent is continually increasing.
The G7 ministers and the Monetary Fund have made progress in a few key areas, such as, for example, the international financial institutions, which clearly act with greater transparency these days.
There is also the International Monetary Fund itself, which has increased its capacity and is fine-tuning its instruments so that they will enable it to analyse, assess and oversee the stability of the financial system more efficiently.
I would also say that coordination between the various national supervisory authorities has improved substantially.
Of course, we cannot rest on our laurels as a result of these improvements.
Much still remains to be done and, in its report, Parliament shows the correct way forward.
The Commission is quite happy to accept your view that we must ensure full participation by the private sector in solving and managing financial crises.
Not only in order to ensure that responsibilities in times of crisis are shared in an equitable way, but also that the private sector is appropriately and systematically involved, which is crucial to effective crisis prevention, thereby preventing dangerous and, ultimately, unsustainable, risk situations from arising.
I do, therefore, take note of the call for the Commission to consider the viability of introducing clauses for collective action on financial instruments such as securities.
You all know as well as I do that the Member States do not fully agree with this position but it is a point of view that the Commission takes seriously, as we do all references to the fight against the funding of terrorism.
The 11 September attacks have brought to the fore the abuses of the financial system by terrorists and the Commission has already adopted certain measures in this field.
You have also made an effective contribution by finalising the codecision procedure on the second directive on money laundering.
Nevertheless, we must keep making progress in this area.
We are now in the early days of a process which will be long and we must continue working in this direction over the coming months.
It is important that we make rapid progress on each of the proposals that provide valuable instruments for combating the funding of terrorism.
I wish to make a brief comment on one point that is still a source of some frustration to us, and that is the external representation of the European Union.
The explanatory statement of the motion for a resolution refers to Europe' s conspicuous absence from the debate on a new financial architecture.
You criticise the fact that the isolated initiatives of some Member States do not form a European policy.
The Commission can only agree with this analysis.
So how do we respond?
What can we do?
How can we improve the situation?
I would say that it is not simply a matter of improving coordination and of speaking with one voice.
Economic and Monetary Union has undoubtedly transformed the blueprint of worldwide financial and monetary relations, but the way in which we continue to address these issues in the main organisations and forums, including the Monetary Fund and the G7, is still based, to a large extent, on a purely national concept.
I can, therefore, only agree on the need to make progress.
I think we will find it very difficult to formulate a meaningful policy in this area unless we clearly state our European positions as such at world level.
This will require a more appropriate and clearly defined external representation of our interests.
I am aware, however, that it will be very difficult to make progress in this direction unless we first make progress on the substance.
Focusing the battle solely on our representation abroad is not as important as defining our own positions and producing coordinated policies on external matters.
These two steps must be made in the same direction and at the same time.
And on these points, Parliament can be sure that the Commission will continue to make progress.
Thank you, Commissioner Solbes.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 8.47 p.m.)
Mr President, colleagues will have read in some of this morning's newspapers about the refusal of the Republic of France to recognise the extraterritorial status of the European Parliament.
Apparently, the French government has refused to issue a visa to the President of the Republic of China to allow him to come to Parliament for a meeting.
This is a denial of our status as a supranational Parliament, and I hope that you will be protesting to the French government about the fact that Mr Chen has not been allowed a visa. . .
- . . . and insisting that we, in the European Union, should be recognising a country which has existed as a flourishing parliamentary democracy for some 14 years and the status it must have in a world in which democracies must work together.
(Applause)
I have taken note of what you have said.
The President will, of course, be duly informed.
Decision on urgent procedure

Mr President, I recommend that urgent procedure be applied to this document because it would also make it easier for China to take part in the forthcoming meeting in Doha.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
Proposal for a Council decision establishing the Community position within the Ministerial Conference set up by the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation on the accession of the separate customs territory of Chinese Taipei (Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu) to the World Trade Organisation
[COM(2001) 518 - C5-0488/01 - 2001/0216(CNS)]

Mr President, the same argument in favour of urgent procedure applies in this case as applied to the previous matter, namely, that Taiwan too should be able to take part in the meeting in Doha.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
Community incentive measures in the field of employment
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0319/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council decision on Community incentive measures in the field of employment [8432/1/2001 - C5-0294/2001 - 2000/0195(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Jensen).
Madam Commissioner, the EU' s employment policy is one of open cooperation in which the Member States set common goals, exchange experiences and evaluate each other' s results and employment policies. It is an open process in which the individual country itself chooses which funds it will use in order to achieve the common goals.
We, in Parliament, should also like to see the process become more open by involving and engaging the general public more. The report we are debating today is about the implementation of Article 129 of the Treaty of Amsterdam concerning employment policy incentives.
It is about appropriations to the work on employment policy over the next five years and about money for analyses, statistics, conferences and reports etc.
Employment policy is to be evaluated in 2003. It will be the first open coordination to be evaluated, and the money for employment policy is also to be used for this evaluation.
At Parliament' s first reading, we adopted 17 amendments to the Commission' s proposal, covering the following themes.
We should like to see the social partners and local and regional authorities more involved in the process, and we should like to see greater focus placed upon the ways in which information and employment policy affects a broader public.
We should like to see more focus on the equal treatment of women in employment policy; we should like to receive some further proposals concerning Parliament' s involvement; and we should like to look at the connection with other Community activities.
Last but not least, we should like to see pilot projects to increase information about employment policy at local and regional levels and help develop relevant strategies.
As a result, Parliament proposed an increase in the budget.
The Council thereupon accepted a number of Parliament' s amendments, including those aimed at involving the local and regional levels and at involving the social partners more.
Some of the proposals concerning greater focus on equality have also been accepted, but the Council did not want to accept some very central proposals from Parliament.
Against that background, there was a great deal of support in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for Parliament' s re-tabling those proposals from the first reading that the Council did not accept.
A majority of Parliament has campaigned for a long time for local and regional efforts to be incorporated into employment policy, and we have pointed out that the exchange of experiences and methods with those operating at local level and working in a voluntary capacity could be financed via Article 129.
That is because it is clearly characteristic of unemployment in the EU to be focused in regions and local areas and in pockets of poverty where there are islands of unemployment.
Local efforts are central when it comes to getting people into work. That is why it makes good sense to talk about local action plans and about the exchange of experiences and information from this work.
I am quite convinced that greater focus on local efforts will make all of us much wiser about the new avenues that might be explored in employment policy.
We have supported local employment initiatives by means of preparatory action, for which there has been a budget line called B5-503, and it is Parliament' s desire that this initiative should be followed up and continued via pilot projects under Article 129.
Perhaps the expression 'projects' is misleading, for we want, of course, to see a development of the methodical work carried out, that is to say analyses and studies and the development of statistics and methods.
We do not wish, under Article 129, to finance projects with the project-oriented and experimental character of projects financed under Article 6 of the Social Fund. There is therefore no question of our wanting to duplicate things that are already happening under the aegis of the Social Fund.
On the contrary. There are many of us who are happy about the open coordination method of employment policy, for it enables the Member States to improve their results in employment policy, learn from each other' s experiences and actually compete to obtain better results.
There will not, however, be very much of that healthy competition as long as employment policy and the 'Luxembourg process' are as unfamiliar to people as they are at present.
In many countries' national parliaments, there is no debate on national employment plans. Nor are there any other activities that might make the process and the results better known and create more grassroots support.
Is political coordination based on analyses and statistics debated by the same politicians, officials and experts at conferences around the EU really binding enough?
No, let us obtain a much greater awareness of results and objectives, so that governments encounter much greater commitment and a desire for everyone to achieve the results obtained in those countries which have most success in employment policy.
Mr President, after first congratulating and thanking Mrs Jensen for her good work, I would like to start my speech with reference to the fact that last Sunday, in Galicia - my country - a former Member of this European Parliament, Manuel Fraga Iribarne, founder of the Spanish Popular Party, obtained, for the fourth time running, an absolute majority in the elections to the Galician Parliament.
I mention this because, during its twelve years in power, the Fraga government has been constantly concerned about the issues and problems arising from the lack of employment in Galicia, and for this reason, during the latest election campaign, it made a commitment to providing jobs for the young unemployed under the age of 30 consisting of a one-year contract for those who have been out of work or unemployed for six consecutive years.
This concern about employment, as laid down in Article 3 of the Treaty and which takes the form of a European Community action for promoting the coordination of employment policies in Member States, confirmed by the special European Councils on employment in Luxembourg and Lisbon, which resolutely advocate a global employment strategy, implies and demands a systematic mobilisation of all Community employment policies, whether these be framework policies or support policies.
If we want to become a knowledge-based economy that is both competitive and dynamic, able to grow economically in a sustainable fashion, with more and better jobs and with greater social cohesion, so that we can once again meet the conditions necessary for full employment, we should encourage the coordination of employment policies between Member States, upholding, of course, the right to make decisions that correspond to the particular circumstances of each Member State, the exchange of good practices, including the aforementioned forms of participation for social partners and also local and regional authorities, without forgetting the need for the coordination of policies directed towards the creation of employment.
I therefore think that the commitment made by Mr Fraga Iribarne is good practice that could be exported or exchanged with others.
It will provide Galician youth with the chance to become integrated into the labour market, make it easier for them to gain the necessary training and experience, both in their quest for a first job as well as subsequently being able to keep that job or to move on to other jobs.
I think that this is good practice, in the same way that the practice for the conciliation of family life with professional life was also good, another initiative of the Galician government.
Mr President, I, too, should like to thank Mrs Jensen for a brilliant report.
It is a good day today, for today' s vote should show that we are now all endorsing the fact that employment policy is not just something made behind desks at meetings of the Council of Ministers, but is something that must be rolled out among the people.
Information must be provided about it, and the local authorities that are to help set these things in motion must also be involved.
That is what we are voting on today.
There are many good things in Mrs Jensen' s report.
I would emphasise what we have agreed concerning the local dimension of employment policy.
Gradually, we have got the Commission and the Council to realise that local and regional authorities, the social partners and non-profit organisations are important in the context of employment initiatives.
Practical work aimed at getting people into employment is done locally.
That is why room must be made for local players.
However, support for local initiatives is required, for example, in the form of better information about what the common European employment policy is and what the objectives are.
That is why it is important for us to put incentive measures in place and for us to appropriate some money to enable us to learn from each other' s methods and experiences.
That, moreover, is what we are trying to do here today.
That is why it is also disappointing that it has been difficult to get the Commission to agree to increasing the budget so that we might appropriate this money, and that is why we, in the Group of the Party of European Socialists, have naturally endorsed the need to increase the amount to EUR 55 million, and not EUR 50 million.
I hope that we obtain broad support today and that the Commission and the Council are alert to the signal from Parliament today.
Mr Pronk, after the Commissioner' s speech, we will see whether your pessimism is justified.
Mr President, we support Mrs Jensen's report because it is based on concepts and policies which we fully endorse.
To start with, we need to make sure the citizens of the Union know what the European Employment Strategy is.
That is the only way they can perceive our common objectives and add their ideas to the Luxembourg process and it is the only way to ensure the relevant national, regional and local authorities benefit from the best practices which have proven to be efficient in other areas of the Union, such as those which the honourable Mr Pérez Álvarez has just mentioned.
Mrs Jensen's other proposal concerns the role of local society in both planning and implementing employment policies.
We must make ensure that all the Member States understand that it is crucial for the social partners and civil society to be involved if this effort to increase employment is to be effective.
And the Member States must change their structures and implement measures to create institutions and resources which will allow local employment pacts to be applied.
On the other hand, the European Union also needs to back these structures with its policies, advice and resources.
We already have experience of numerous countries, including Greece, in which local employment pacts have failed to work.
In some cases, they were policies applied by the central administration to encourage a few additional measures in areas with problems; they did not mobilise local society and they did not have the required results.
I am sure other areas in the Union have had similar bad experiences, which is why we believe that the measures proposed by the honourable Member and other policies in this sector of the European Union should be coordinated and dealt with at European and national level in order to give new impetus to employment planning and implementation at local level.
Mr President, I will try, as you request, to transform Mr Pronk's pessimism to optimism!
This programme gives effect to Article 129 of the Treaty which provides that incentive measures may be adopted in order to encourage cooperation between Member States and support their action in the field of employment.
Here I very much agree with what Mrs Thorning-Schmidt has already said: it is not a matter of employment or a matter of Council meetings, it is a matter of real cooperation between the Member States.
The programme underpins the European Employment Strategy and provides for activities to ensure its continuing effectiveness.
It is important that it is going to be adopted in the near future and I am hopeful that outstanding concerns expressed in the 14 amendments submitted can be resolved satisfactorily.
In its amended proposal the Commission, after the first reading, accepted in full or in part 12 of the 17 amendments tabled by Parliament.
The common position which you have been considering, while significantly different in format and presentation from the amended proposal, contains resonances of the ten amendments.
In relation to the amendments which are now under consideration, the Commission can accept nine of them in full or in part.
Those are Amendments Nos 1-8 and 14.
I should like to specify exactly what I accept.
Amendments Nos 1-3 I accept in full.
In Amendment No 4, I very much welcome the reference to special attention to groups subject to multiple discrimination in their access to the labour market and I share your concerns that we should be able to understand, monitor and analyse developments in mainstreaming by establishing indicators.
I do not consider it appropriate, however, to enter into details on specific studies to be carried out and cannot accept this part of the amendment.
On Amendment No 5, I am very pleased with the emphasis you introduce with regard to the importance of promoting public knowledge of the European Employment Strategy and further encouraging individuals and organisations at all levels to contribute to enhancing its impact and effectiveness.
This programme should and will assist in the realisation of those objectives.
However, assigning funding for the 'projects' in this context is not appropriate, and I have to reject that part of Amendment No 5.
Our diverging views on Amendment No 5 may lie more in the wording used than in any disagreement on its intent.
Local projects involving local actors are funded through Article 6 and the European Social Fund regulation, as well as through another budget line - B5-503.
The latter is available exclusively for the funding of local development projects.
The analysis, research and evaluation work which it incorporates will include measures, informed by the outcomes of the projects delivered under other budget lines, to assess how knowledge of the European Employment Strategy, and local level involvement in its delivery, might be further improved.
I hope that this approach will meet your concerns.
With regard to Amendment No 8, I again fully subscribe to the principle of consistency and accept this part but I cannot agree to specify each linked programme.
Amendments Nos 6 and 7 are taken on board in spirit by the inclusion of Amendment No 1, and Amendment No 14, I can fully support.
Unfortunately, I am not in a position to accept Amendments Nos 9-13.
I will briefly explain why: Amendments Nos 9 and 10 concern the committee.
While I am grateful for your support for the Commission's role and the re-institution of an advisory committee, this is a lost fight with the Council.
Looking at the legal framework and recent precedents, a mixed committee is a fair compromise.
We could look at the mandate in future discussions to see if this could be adopted to meet your concerns as part of a global compromise.
On the annual plans in Amendment No 11, this is an internal Commission question which has no place in a Parliament and Council decision.
Amendment No 12 also has to be rejected on institutional grounds and more specifically with reference to the framework agreement on interinstitutional relationships.
Finally, regarding Amendment No 13, we maintain the EUR 55 million initially proposed.
We have made a thorough analysis and this is an adequate figure for the activities envisaged.
To sum up, the Commission can accept in full or in spirit Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 14; it can accept in part Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 8; it rejects Amendments Nos 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.
It is clear that some issues have to be resolved; some of them are more sensitive than others.
I have, however, taken the most positive approach possible to the amendments which you have tabled.
Accordingly, I am hopeful that, with your cooperation and that of the Council, we can soon identify a compromise which is acceptable to all.
I once again reiterate the urgency of this matter and the Commission's resolve to help find workable compromises.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Informing and consulting employees
Mr President, the information, consultation and participation of employees assumed primary importance in the European debate as far back as 1974, when the first social action programme was adopted by the Council.
Since then, the issue has featured in many of our debates in this Chamber and the Commission has launched a large number of initiatives, which have met with resistance.
Almost all the Member States have a legislative or contractual legal framework in place intended to guarantee the information and consultation of employees.
This directive proposes the introduction of minimum information and consultation standards which would be implemented throughout Union territory: after the European Company Statute, the European Works Council Directive and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the directive before us today completes the existing Community and national frameworks, thus contributing to the ultimate purpose of the law in question which is to ensure that adequate preparations are made for the change, that restructuring takes place under acceptable conditions and that due importance is given to the employment objective in the current situation.
The Commission presented its proposal - a sound proposal - in November 1998, and the European Parliament concluded its first reading in April 1999, adopting a series of amendments to improve it. Only in June 2001 did the Council adopt a common position.
In general terms, the common position reflects the position adopted by the Commission following Parliament' s first reading but, if we compare the first reading of the European Parliament with the common position, we see that thirty or so of the amendments made by Parliament were not actually accepted.
As rapporteur, I called upon the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs not to repropose all the amendments adopted at first reading but concentrate on the most important points in order to improve the common position.
My colleagues - whom I would like to thank for their cooperation - put forward 15 amendments to my proposal, almost all of which serve to reinforce it.
After an in-depth debate, we came up with the text on which the House is to vote today.
There are 16 amendments and they concern: the procedures for consulting employees, and these are in line with the common position but more specific in identifying problems; the definition of economic and financial information; the exact definition of 'social partners' , in order to avoid ambiguities; the protection of employees' representatives, which needs to be better defined in terms of protection against disadvantage with regard to career, wage and training; suspension of decisions which could result in substantial negative consequences for employees, so that the taking of a final decision can be deferred for a suitable period at the request of employees' representatives in order to allow time for further negotiation and for a solution acceptable to all parties to be found.
Transitional periods: this is an extremely sensitive point.
We do not feel that specific transitional periods are necessary. Precisely because this directive introduces minimum standard rights, it must be enforced for all European employees simultaneously.
The question of penalties is the most sensitive point. It has provoked a deluge of lobbies from all sides of the House.
We have decided not to include our initial suggestion of a European penalty with legal effect in our proposal, but we have reinforced the common position, stipulating that it should be the Member States that, whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity, introduce more stringent penalties for serious violations which impact upon employees.
This is an interpretation of the common position, which states that the Member States must lay down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties.
It is my genuine hope that this House will confirm the wide majority reached in committee and will lose no time in providing the Union and the Member States with this major legislative instrument during the Belgian Presidency.


Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Ghilardotti, firstly because she showed a great deal of flexibility in meetings of the Committee, including taking on board a series of proposals by the European People's Party, and secondly because this has meant that her very good report on the Common Position on the framework directive for minimum standards in national employee information and consultation points in the right direction.
As with the directive on European works councils, the issue is not codetermination, but information and consultation on important economic, financial and employment policy developments in business.
Restructuring cannot and should not be hindered, but it must no longer take place in the form of a commando raid, as so often happens - witness Renault's shock at Vilvoorde - but only following prior notification of the employees concerned.
There are, though, many parallels with the works councils directive in other respects.
The regulations on European works councils apply only to mergers of businesses across national boundaries, but restructuring often takes place at a national level.
The European People's Party favours flexibility.
For example, management and labour in a business can, through agreements, arrive at a special made-to-measure arrangement on information and consultation for that business.
That is subsidiarity.
The Common Position says rightly that agreements should be able to be more, or even less, favourable than the minimum standard.
Yet, the rights of local works councils may not be jeopardised under national law.
Article 1 prescribes that the procedure should be carried on in a spirit of cooperation.
This means partnership.
Partnership aims on the one hand at the clear representation of interests, and on the other hand at their conciliation in shared dialogue through information and consultation.
There is no doubt that this is economically advantageous.
Inadequate information results in insecurity, mistrust, and finally only fear, ending in blockade.
Timely information means transparency that creates trust and avoids businesses making friction losses.
Both workers and employers are winners, and in the same way.
Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs Ghilardotti has already indicated how difficult it has been to present this issue for second reading.
My group' s first priority, therefore, is to bring this issue to an end at long last and to have it published in the Official Journal.
We thus hope that agreement with the Council will be reached in the near future.
This is also evident from the stance adopted by our group, as Mrs Ghilardotti stated.
We dropped a huge number of amendments from first reading and concentrated in the committee on a number of compromise texts, on which it must be possible to reach agreement, in our view.
For example, we deleted the precious point on Tendenzschutz, which we would have liked to have seen scrapped.
Neither will we be backing the Group of the Greens and the GUE/NGL Group on this matter in the framework of reaching a compromise.
However, we hope that the PPE-DE will continue to support the compromise proposals we reached in committee.
The differences of opinion with the Council mainly revolve around two key points: the provisions on sanctions and the unnecessarily long transitional periods.
I should like to note that these are not points which we have added but, rather, points which the Council has added to the Commission position. Parliament is not asking for points to be added.
In this case, it is the Council which is departing from the Commission proposal.
I will briefly comment on those two points.
With regard to the sanction provisions, Mr Menrad has also already communicated their importance in order for the directive to be taken really seriously.
In this connection, I would like to refer to the experience in my own country.
In the Netherlands, this kind of sanction exists in legislation pertaining to works councils.
Precisely those provisions have an extremely preventative effect.
It is not often that legal steps are required, but the very fact that it is possible to take these steps means that very intense consultations are often held.
With regard to closures and transfers which need to take place, a very broad support structure is created and sound consultations are held.
That is very important for industrial relations, in my opinion.
The second point concerns transitional periods.
I already stated last week, at a meeting which Mr Bushill-Matthews had organised with an English association of people who, in fact, propagate the idea of employee participation, that it strikes me as bizarre that they call for a much longer transitional period.
If one considers - as they did - that information and consultation are very important, not only to employees but also to employers and to the company' s performance, then one must ensure that this measure is introduced very promptly.
One should not ask for longer transitional periods, for that gives British industry entirely the wrong signal.
I would therefore ask you to reconsider this and to support these conventional transitional periods, as proposed by the Commission, after all.
Come what may, based on the experience which we have gathered in the Netherlands with an act that has been in force for more than 50 years, it appears that industrial relations have improved as a result.
Mr President, I, too, wish to thank Mrs Ghilardotti for the sound and skilful work she has done on this report.
I also wish, in particular, to thank her for her understanding of the minority views that may be adopted by a Danish MEP in this situation, for we have a special system of consultation and cooperation in the labour market which creates problems for us from time to time.
We all agree, of course, that information and consultation and a good social dialogue are important.
It has become a part of modern management to attach importance to these things, to involve employees and to talk about learning organisations, so enabling companies to develop better.
I believe it is important that, when we talk about these matters, we do not only view information and consultation as part and parcel of restructuring and the reduction of the labour force, but as also being a part of day-to-day work in which it takes a long time to build up mutual confidence and that reciprocal dialogue that can be of value both to employees and companies in a crisis situation and which may also perhaps play a part in preventing crises from breaking out within companies.
We have had a long period in which it was difficult getting everyone to understand the need for revising this directive, and revision has been blocked by a majority of the Council.
Denmark has been a part of that blocking majority, not because we are nervous about having rules on information and consultation - we have in actual fact had stringent rules on these matters from as far back as 1960 - but because we are afraid that common rules might create problems for the system we think works well in practice.
It would, of course, be an irony of fate if common rules were to be destructive in an area in which matters are operating well.
Flexibility is a key word when it comes to drawing up the common rules, but there must not of course be so much flexibility that the required information and consultation does not occur in those places in which these things have not been emphasised.
I must say, therefore, that, on the whole, my group is able to support Mrs Ghilardotti' s proposals.
We have some problems where the sanctions are concerned, and I must say that the Council' s solution is an extremely fine balance that it is very difficult not to upset.
There is therefore a single point in regard to which we cannot completely endorse the strict rules indicated in Mrs Ghilardotti' s report but in regard to which we prefer to endorse the Council' s solution.
On the other hand, I want to say, on the subject of interim arrangements, that it is a question of putting these in place.
Let us now get these matters implemented and not just continue to talk about them.
Information and consultation are not a punishment for business. On the contrary, they are things that promote good business and competitiveness.
Mr President, my group supports the recommendation for second reading, which, moreover, received the very broad approval of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
In addition, we would like the Council to follow suit and thus put a definitive end to the three long years that have passed since the Commission, perceiving the breakdown in social dialogue, made very timely use of its right of initiative.
This is three years too many, which have been punctuated by social catastrophes, with rapid liquidation of businesses and loss of jobs due to bankruptcy and genuine distortions in Community social law on information and consultation of workers.
While we must not expect miracles from this directive, because it will only apply, at best, to businesses with more than 50 employees and will not single-handedly resolve the fundamental problem, namely that competition law is dominant, this directive may represent a significant step towards harmonising the rights of European Union employees, subject, of course, to it not being stripped of its content and reduced to the smallest common denominator.
This is why it is so important that the Council take into consideration the recommendations proposed by Mrs Ghilardotti, particularly Amendment Nos 2 and 12 on sanctions for disregard of the directive.
Although the Council is opposed to European sanctions, the least it can do, in my view, is to accept this compromise position.
We also support amendments which clarify and widen the scope of the information that must be provided to employees' representatives, and the amendment proposing the latter may request a decision' s application be suspended, pending the outcome of new negotiations, where this decision has serious effects on jobs.
If our citizens are to find this directive credible, it will have to be applied simultaneously throughout the European Union.
That is why our group asks the Council to support the position submitted to us, and make it impossible for some Member States to evade having to enforce the application of the directive for several more years.
Our group proposes to supplement the draft recommendation by adopting amendments that rule out the possibility of withholding information that the company considers sensitive to its business from employees' representatives, because we are convinced that there are no grounds, that it even constitutes discrimination to introduce an element of suspicion with regard to employees who, by definition, have no less company spirit than the management or shareholders.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, despite the fact that it has welcomed some of the positions adopted by the European Parliament, I find it deplorable that the Council persists in maintaining a proposal for a directive that fails to meet the expectations of workers in the European Union.
When you see the behaviour of the directors of many companies, especially the multinationals, who decide to restructure, relocate or even partially or totally close down their businesses, making hundreds or thousands of workers unemployed simply to cut costs and/or increase profits, it is all the more intolerable that the Council should not have accepted proposals that we have adopted in this House.
Examples of these are:
the reference to the planning stage in the definition of consultation, its extension to cover economic and financial developments in the company and the obligation to seek agreement on all issues subject to the information and consultation of workers.
extending consultation in particularly serious cases; extending the concept of a serious breach of the obligations to inform and consult; the implementation of the directive on public administration.
the abolition of the employer' s right to retain particularly sensitive information and the obligation for Member States to promote social dialogue within SMEs.
These are our reasons for supporting Mrs Ghilardotti' s proposals, which once again take up the positions adopted at first reading, with particular emphasis on the amendments that seek to step up sanctions and specific legal proceedings in cases where the directive is breached, on suspending decisions at the request of workers' representatives when their implementation has serious consequences for workers, with a view to eliminating or minimising these harmful consequences, on eliminating the transitional periods for the directive' s implementation in Member States that do not have a system of worker consultation and on reducing the period of transposition into national law to two years as well as its implementation in the public sector.
These are positive proposals which, as I said, we support.
I can only regret the fact, however, that the rapporteur has dropped her two proposals on eliminating the option the Council wishes to give employers to, in certain cases, neither inform nor consult their workers, although the rapporteur' s proposals envisage sanctions against employers that fail to act promptly.
The Council' s position, however, opens up loopholes that could prove dangerous for workers and it is, therefore, important to eliminate this possibility.
This is the basic justification for the two amendments that we have tabled in conjunction with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
We hope that a majority in Parliament votes in favour of these and that the Council takes account of the positions that have been put forward here in one of the most sensitive areas of the protection of workers' rights.
Mr President, the subject addressed so well by Mrs Ghilardotti' s report is, as we all know, not a new one, but on past occasions when it was discussed it has never been set out so clearly.
I refer, in particular, to the legislation on European works councils, which has not been transposed by all the Member States and, where it has been transposed, has not been incorporated into their legislation but is regulated by means of agreements between the social partners which are often then disregarded by one of the partners, as has been shown by recent events which, moreover, have been debated in this very House.
Yet Parliament, which has, in the past, been attentive to the issue of employment and openly involved in establishing and guaranteeing the dignity and even the quality of work, and which, moreover, has not hesitated to propose sanctions for the cases I have mentioned which even involved requirements governing the use of European funds for maintaining employment levels, has shown varying degrees of indecision in the debate on this report.
The different attitudes are certainly understandable, given the sensitive nature of some issues such as the enforcement of sanctions, for sanctions do have to be enforced if one wants a requirement to be respected, or the confidentiality granting exemption from the consultation procedure to be removed, even though it is no longer observed, or a transitional period to be granted for the transposal of the directive which is, moreover, unnecessary, given the time frame for its implementation.
The fact is that, both in terms of the continuous implementation of Community law, the continuing hope of ever-increasing cohesion and, lastly, the forthcoming practical introduction of a European Company which would provide greater protection of employees as regards participation than other forms of legal entity, the issue had to be closed, with the identification of major, related questions ranging from the contents of the information to the termination clause, from the time frame for initiating the procedure to the parties involved and to the sectors where it is to be applied, and all this in respect, on the one hand, for the fair trade requirement, which, also in this case, would be guaranteed by the different behaviour of the Member States, and, on the other hand, for the reasoning of the open coordination method, which has, at last, started to be applied practically in social policy.
Clearly, the issue in question lends itself to being addressed within the context of the principle of subsidiarity, even though that concept still remains to be clearly defined today, despite the fact that it is one of the founding principles of the Union itself.
However, it must be said that the definition and application of the principle does not and cannot serve the single purpose of calling for competence for certain subjects to be given to the Member States alone, for there is also a conflicting, appropriate need to provide the Union, in the face of great national differences and oversights, with a basic definition of these subjects wherever they have any significant implications for the Community as a whole.
Mr President, allow me to begin by stating that I think it very important that minimum standards be set for informing and consulting employees, but that it is just as important that it be done in a way that does not disrupt existing national arrangements that are operating well.
It has unfortunately proved that not all Member States have been in a position to draft national guidelines for informing and consulting employees.
That would otherwise have been the best solution when it comes to companies in the individual countries, for it is, of course, there, that the real problems arise.
Political unity has now been achieved in the Council concerning the revised proposal from the Swedish Presidency and the graduated transitional arrangement, as proposed by the Commission.
In Denmark, we have no direct laws about informing and consulting employees.
That does not, however, mean that employees are not consulted and informed in Denmark. This is specifically regulated via cooperation agreements between the social partners in accordance with the Danish tradition of greater freedom between the social partners.
Only when it is strictly necessary does the government get involved.
The Danish government has therefore stated in the Council that it assumes that the current cooperation agreements in the Danish labour market comply with the directive' s requirements. The Danish government will also issue a statement in the Council to the effect that implementation of the directive will not affect existing agreements in this area in Denmark and that these will be fully respected when implementation takes place, but that it will of course be necessary to enact legislation for those companies not covered by the existing cooperation agreements.
I should like to ask the Commission whether it is of the same view as the Danish government.
In other words, is the Commission able to ensure that the social partners themselves are given the freedom to enter into, and maintain, the existing agreements and procedures about informing and consulting employees, just as Denmark was given a similar assurance in connection with the compromise reached by the Council in July?
I should also like to thank Mrs Ghilardotti for having agreed that sanctions must be established nationally.
It is very important that the Member States themselves should devise appropriate sanctions, that this is done by means of agreements between the social partners and that we take account of the Member States' different systems.
If Parliament had maintained its hard line, the proposal could have been rejected by the Council, and that would have been a major defeat for the unions which, for years, have been campaigning for the right of employees to be informed and consulted.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, the view that it is, in general, appropriate and also necessary to ensure an adequate flow of information between a company and all its stakeholders, especially the employees involved in the life of the company, is, I believe, widely held, including by myself.
However, I am not in favour of imposing on the States, the individual Member States, solutions which involve employees in management decisions, on the basis, in some cases, of joint management models which are foreign to the legal and economic traditions of many European countries, as has just been said.
I therefore feel that, in line with both the Commission' s initial proposal and the Council' s common position, the directive before us needs to leave the Member States sufficient room for manoeuvre to identify the best way of adhering to the principle of the need to keep employees informed.
However, many of the amendments adopted by the Commission and included in the common position which we are about to put to the vote conflict with this, particularly Amendments Nos 2 and 12, which seek to grant employees' representatives a sort of de facto - and I repeat, de facto - right of veto on decisions taken by companies.
I therefore call upon Parliament not to adopt the amendments and to stay with the Council' s common position.
I would like to make one last point: Article 3 (2) lays down specific provisions applying to political associations, trade associations and religious organisations etc.
Does this mean that political parties, trade unions and churches can carry out restructuring without informing their employees, while normal companies are obliged to do so?
This is my question.
Mr President, we are dealing with a long history and a relatively complex directive.
Fortunately, the Council' s common position is very useful and provides a sound basis for our further debate.
In fact, a number of people, including a large number of socialist ministers, are of the opinion that we should not have anything other than the common position.
I am not certain whether they truly believe this or whether they think that they will then be able to put the whole thing behind them.
In any event, that is the state of play.
Although the stance adopted by our group has been expressed very eloquently by Mr Winfried Menrad, he very much takes the common position into account, as well as the amendments adopted at first reading, a number of which - I have to say - we were unable to support.
We voted against a number of amendments, but as they are not included in the present package, that is not such a big issue.
There is now a sound compromise proposal before us by Parliament, also accommodating the Council.
We make no bones about the fact that our group is struggling with a number of amendments.
There are also a number of amendments which some delegations in our group find it difficult to come to terms with.
But on the whole, I believe we can congratulate the rapporteur warmly on her work.
I also believe that if we have voted on this matter by lunchtime today, we will have made a significant contribution to informing and consulting employees in Europe.
We must not forget that an incredible number of problems have arisen.
Over the years, we have discussed many resolutions dealing with the lack of consultation.
If this is now rectified properly, we will have made huge progress, in my opinion.
Mr President, I do not speak for my Group on this matter, but I want to congratulate Mrs Ghilardotti for her hard work in making this directive a reality.
We hope this directive will develop into a new partnership between workers and management and strengthen dialogue.
That, in turn, will improve flexibility and productivity.
We have a directive which is essentially a two-way street.
It must make sense for workers in retail, service and manufacturing industries not to learn about their future through the media, but to work within a positive consultation mechanism making them aware of what will happen to them and their families.
The question is whether existing laws work well.
There is plenty of evidence that they do not.
Workers in my own country at Rover/BMW, Marks & Spencers, in Longbridge, at Corus and Vauxhall - the list is endless - would all benefit from this directive.
The directive is essentially about the future of work, not the past.
When closure is inevitable for companies with more than 50 workers, we want to see information and consultation, so that workers are informed, leading to a better level of trust within companies.
We need realistic thresholds to allow the directive to work well.
In discussions with trade unions and business, it is clear that companies need to be made aware of their responsibilities.
The responsibilities work both ways.
Colleagues, information and consultation has been a very difficult directive.
There have been a number of compromise amendments.
We are very happy with the way in which those discussions have progressed.
It is clear that some Member States will continue to have problems with certain aspects of this directive.
We must work together to ensure that in conciliation we reach the stage where information and consultation are embraced by both sides of business and industry.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work on this report.
I am one of the Members who has spoken in this House previously regretting the fact that we did not have the kind of legislation that we are discussing today.
I know that myself, along with several other colleagues, have been in the very unfortunate position of representing constituents who have suffered the very worst examples of the lack of consultation and the lack of information.
Workers who have learned of job losses in the press and media when there has been speculation and uncertainty in the workplace.
I only have to mention what happened with Corus in Wales earlier this year for you to see why I attach such importance to this particular piece of legislation.
I am therefore particularly pleased to have the opportunity to welcome this proposal which will change things.
It will mean that employees will be involved in discussions when there really is still an opportunity to influence the debate and the outcome, not when the decision is more or less a fait accompli.
Employees would have to be given all the relevant facts.
While certain measures are needed to protect a company's commercial interests, my group believes that these are adequately covered.
The ability to impose sanctions is one of the most important aspects of this report, including the suspension of decisions which lead to job losses if the consultation guidelines have not been followed.
Voluntary agreements are not enough.
We often hear about good examples of voluntary agreements.
I applaud those companies that follow good practice, but many do not.
We have seen that time and time again especially in Wales and Britain where we have had no legislation on information and consultation to date.
I am very pleased that there has at last been progress on this crucial matter.
I believe, as others have said, that we cannot wait too long for this to come into effect which is why I support the shorter transition period.
This proposal, of course, would not prevent job losses, but it would allow enough time to ensure that plans for rescaling and retraining of workforces could be well advanced before closures or redundancies take place. This is an issue of the effectiveness of companies and businesses.
It should be a part of the everyday work of companies and businesses.
It is also about dignity in the workplace.
Employees are an integral part of the partnership with management and must be kept informed on decisions which affect not only their lives, but those of their families and whole communities.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Ghilardotti' s report on the directive on information and consultation of workers is very topical indeed.
Many Member States of the European Union have, unfortunately, been faced with a wave of mergers, restructurings and numerous redundancies, such as at Danone, Marks and Spencer and Moulinex, to name but a few.
Until now, the directive has not enabled employees to take any effective action and to have a real bearing on their future, and that of the business.
In many other cases, the directive has not been applied.
That is why I support the proposals made in the report by Mrs Ghilardotti, because the directive strengthens provisions and provides the means to apply these provisions.
The Council included Parliament' s amendments in its common position; the reference to the most favourable provisions for employees, the obligation to respect minimum requirements, and the non-regression clause.
Although this is a step forward, we must go further, as proposed in Mrs Ghilardotti' s report.
Some important amendments have again been proposed, which improve the report.
For example, employees shall be consulted and informed at the planning stage, before decisions are taken.
For example, if the decision has an adverse effect on employees, such as collective redundancies or closure, the final decision must be postponed so that consultations can continue with a view to avoiding or mitigating the consequences.
This directive will enable us to begin to encourage an approach to economic and social issues, which includes improving working conditions and economic efficiency.
This efficiency requires the involvement of employees, naturally.
That is why we are proposing two amendments, which rule out the possibility of withholding information where there is a risk or prejudice to the business.
To demand discretion is one thing. To enable the company' s management, once again, to take unilateral decisions on the nature of the information is quite another.
Obviously, we must be determined to ensure this directive is observed, and I hope that, this time, the Council will heed Parliament' s will.
Mr President, the company is clearly an example of plurality.
According to Max Weber, a company is an organisation that, in controlling goods and services, aims to produce goods and services for a particular market.
It is also clear that those who lend their services to a company cannot always relate to their employer directly or on a personal level, above all when the number of employees in that company exceeds a certain level.
There therefore needs to be the implementation of some kind of permanent and flexible mechanism which would facilitate this relationship, functioning in a way that is simple yet effective and which can deal with the multitude of issues that arise in a company every day.
The everyday life of a company, in this day and age, takes place within a global world - globalisation is the key word - a globalisation which does not exclusively affect large or very large companies, but also those of a small or medium size, because they are also having to function within this environment.
So, what exactly is the problem?
Well, we need to regulate rights to information and consultation with true content within the specific framework in which we operate, that is to say that it is not a simple case of paying lip service to these declarations, but neither do we want to go too far, depriving the management of its powers.
I think that this is what Mrs Ghilardotti set out to achieve in her arduous and efficient work: I think that she was seeking this point of equilibrium, and, yes, it is difficult - I would say practically impossible - for some delegations, such as the Spanish, to vote for the content of Amendment No 12, and for the rest, we have to underline the work she has undertaken and congratulate her on her effort.
Evidently, a company' s own capacity to adapt, more necessary today than ever before, is going to be strengthened if we are able to convey its needs, concerns and prospects to all its workers.
More than just an exhaustive regulation, we are talking about an advanced communication culture within the company.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we are all well aware, I believe that we are about to take a decisive step along the path to adopting a general framework on the information and consultation rights of workers.
We can only welcome this and we must congratulate Mrs Ghilardotti, the rapporteur, who has spared no effort in ensuring that today we have reached a position that we are defending.
It has been almost three years since the draft directive was published, and during this time, we in this House have had to condemn many situations.
There have been site closures, redundancies and relocations, without any prior information being given by the companies to the employees concerned.
Of course, this directive is far from ideal - it does not provide a ban on redundancies - but it illustrates the determination to make up for these shortcomings, firstly, in national legislation, but also to correct the occasionally fragmented aspects of Community law that we have already passed, which it also supplements.
These three years of debate have resulted in a text that is now balanced and realistic.
This report is not intransigent, nor is it extremist, and I believe that we should mention the efforts on the part of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the various groups, in negotiating with the Council, to iron out specific differences of opinion.
The European Parliament and the Council are co-legislators and we do not have to blindly support any directive, Mr Pronk. We have to support positions, namely those of Parliament.
I have three points to make; the first relates to confidentiality of specific information.
We have returned to the common position of the Council to acknowledge that there actually are objective situations and contradictions with stock market law, for example, which must be considered and that this confidentiality, in some well-defined cases, can be upheld. My second point relates to sanctions.
There is no law without sanctions, and I believe that what is laid down - I am about to finish, Mr President - where there has been a serious breach is an absolute minimum.
As for transition periods, well, fundamental social rights must simply be applied.
Yet, we can no longer defer the enforcement of these rights.
(Applause from the Left)
Mr President, Commissioner, informing and consulting employees is a basic right.
It is inherent in our European social model and distinguishes us from other social models.
I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur for the sound work and also the Council which, in any case, managed to pull the debate back on track in Nice.
This was timely and also necessary.
If we examine such a framework directive and compare it with the take-over directive which was discussed in this House recently, and subsequently rejected, we can see that this did not fit into a framework directive.
The statute of the European company does fit in, which means that a framework directive is needed for that.
That framework directive is also needed - as has been indicated by various people - if we consider what happened to Renault-Vilvoorde, Michelin, Chorus and other companies.
For example, in the case of Chorus, there is a pronounced difference in the level of information and consultation provided in the Netherlands, for example, compared to England.
Consequently, this directive relies wholly on the quality of information and consultation.
In my opinion, these should be assessed in the fullness of time, but this is a first step.
It is absolutely vital to tackle it this way.
One of the things I am struggling with is the exemption from this directive when a company is said to be at risk.
We have positive experiences in countries where works councils exist, and that applies to the Netherlands, Germany and Austria.
Problems do not arise. There is already a duty of confidentiality, and I should like to urge you to adopt the amendment which we tabled in this connection.

Mr President, the right of employees to be consulted and informed has been enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but what use are frameworks set up at national or EU level, when employees are too often presented with faits accomplis, learning of restructuring processes only after the event or from the media?
I support Mrs Ghilardotti's Amendment No 5, which requires them to be consulted as early as the planning phase, so that they can have some degree of influence.
There was long debate on Amendment No 7, which laid down what information supplied by the employer must include.
This includes the economic situation - developments in the market, the structure of the organisation, the company's strategy - but also turnover and production figures to show the financial position.
This is about in-house information and not in any way about investment control by stealth.
More and more employees have a financial share in their business, now, and so they are well positioned to think entrepreneurially in local and global terms.
They are ready and willing to share responsibility for significant strategies that make their firms more competitive.
Dialogue between informed social partners is a major challenge, and so we also need training and development for qualified employees.
People with in-depth knowledge add to productivity.
These employees are willing to share responsibility even for crucial decisions.
All this adds up to another element in the structure of a modern organisation.
It is in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that dialogue between employer and employee is particularly important.
Mr President, you are right to emphatically put the case for them as well.
This dialogue is to be set in motion in the Member States, in accordance with their current national regulations.
The pressure of competition and the challenges posed by globalisation mean that there is no alternative to cooperation within businesses, provided that it is founded on fairness, openness and timely information.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating my colleague, Mrs Ghilardotti, as well as the Council and the Commission for having finally secured progress on this dossier.
As with the Regulation on the Statute for a European Company a few weeks ago, and the annex on participation, we have been making more progress in the last few months than we had for years.
I think that this gives us an excellent opportunity to send a clear signal to the public that, at European level, we have a concept of the company that encompasses all those that work within it, which, it must also be said, is not only a democratic right of workers, but, also, these principles of information and consultation set the right path for companies to become more efficient, more effective, non-authoritarian and participatory.
In these times of globalisation, lifelong learning and the incorporation of workers into the dynamics of a company are crucial.
We hope, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, that, as Mrs Ghilardotti stated very clearly in her amendments, that this is a genuine regulation.
This will require two obvious and fundamental elements: firstly, that the participation of workers should take place before decisions are made, for if this is not the case, they will carry on finding things out through the papers and they will really be under the impression that the work that has been carried out here in Parliament, in Council and in the Commission is a joke. They have to be involved before decisions are made, because the press is there for everyone else.
Secondly, their participation must also be a legal requirement.
The exact difference between the regulation and the recommendation is that, when the regulation is violated, there can be a sanction.
If there is no sanction, what we do remains purely symbolic and has no legal foundation.
Representatives of the Council, we are at second reading.
I would like to finish by saying that I hope that on this occasion we do not experience what has taken place on so many others, that you forget that Parliament has legislative faculties on a par with your own.
I hope, therefore, that you will take good notice of Mrs Ghilardotti' s report, which is not only for her own good, but for the good of millions of citizens and workers in Europe.
Like my colleagues in the UK Conservative Delegation, I have consistently supported the principle and the practice of employee information and consultation.
In my previous job as managing director of a large UK food manufacturing company, I was very proud to lead the first such company in the whole of the West Midlands Region to achievement of the coveted Investors People Award.
As has already been mentioned, earlier this month I hosted a lunch debate in Brussels with the Involvement and Participation Association for my fellow members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to share with them UK best practice and the benefits of flexibility, because that is the issue.
The common position as it stands is fine, which is why I personally did not put forward any amendments to that, but the committee amendments propose yet another one-size fits-all straitjacket which would be highly damaging to managers' ability to manage and in particular to their ability to manage rapid change.
If companies are held back from taking the key decisions necessary perhaps for the very survival of those businesses, their problems will get worse, which means that more employees could suffer.
The UK government has asked all UK MEPs from all political parties to vote down all these amendments and to support the common position.
Conservative MEPs will do exactly that, so I now call upon UK Labour MEPs to reverse the position they all took in committee when they supported these amendments and to vote with us in the interests of employment and in the interests of the nation.
Mr President, first I would like to apologise: in my introduction I did not mention Mrs Jensen, and I would really like to congratulate her on an excellent job.
As far as Mrs Ghilardotti is concerned, we all know what a difficult job she had and she has.
She had to strike a balance between completely different political, national, social and economic views, and I would like to congratulate her and to thank all the Members of Parliament who have participated in the debate and supported the Commission's proposal through this process.
This is an important proposal and, once adopted, it will add an indispensable element to workers' rights.
Recent events, with mass lay-offs across Europe, have only underlined the urgent need for different kinds of instruments and this proposal - this directive - information and consultation is a very important instrument.
Once adopted, the directive will ensure better anticipation of crises and will contribute to developing a positive attitude towards change by both management and workers.
Let me tell you that I fully understand all your requests.
Most, if not all, of the issues they raise were the subject of intense debate within all the institutions.
The text before us strikes a delicate balance between different points of view and divergent interests on the sensitive issues at stake.
While I understand your desire to improve the text, it would be unwise, in my view, to depart now from that balance and jeopardise the actual adoption of the proposal.
I refer in particular to Amendments Nos 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 16, 18 and 19. Therefore, the Commission is not prepared to accept those amendments.
However, a number of the proposed amendments are acceptable, in full or in part, to the Commission, as they will improve the text.
These are Amendments Nos 3, 6, 8, 13 and 14. The Commission will, therefore, actively support these amendments and will do its utmost to facilitate consensus on them between Parliament and the Council.
Allow me, before moving to the two most important issues - sanctions and transitional periods - to respond to Mrs Sandbæk, as far as the Danish model is concerned.
I would like to underline the fact that the current text strikes a balance between the necessary protection of workers and the autonomy of the social partners, as contracting partners.
They can freely conclude agreements which are not fully in line with the provisions of Article 4, but they have to take into account the principles which are established in Article 1 and in national law.
Now, we know that the most difficult and controversial issues are the two which I have already referred to: sanctions and transitional periods.
With regard to the first of these issues, Amendment No 2 and especially Amendment No 12 propose reinforced sanctions, including judicial suspension procedures in cases of serious breach of information and consultation obligations.
This amendment, while reinforcing the common position, offers a compromise with the Commission's original proposal.
It is, therefore, undeniable that Parliament is making a step in the direction of the Council, in a serious search for a final compromise.
I would like to thank you for your support of the Commission's stance on this very important element of the directive.
Nevertheless, taking into account the sensitivity of the issue in the Council, the best basis for a final compromise on this issue would be to limit the request to the first sentence of the proposed amendment.
Under these circumstances, the Commission can accept Amendment No 2 and the first paragraph of Amendment No 12.
We can accept Amendment No 2 with a minor change.
Finally Amendment No 15 which seeks to delete Article 10 - on transitional periods - is equally a major issue.
In the past, the Commission has always opposed this kind of provision which tends to grant different treatment to different Member States.
This time, we can see some justification in it.
Some Member States will clearly have to introduce major changes to their industrial relations systems.
Therefore, the Commission is of the opinion that Article 10 of the common position constitutes a fair compromise and it cannot accept this amendment.
To sum up, the Commission can accept in full or in spirit Amendments Nos 3 and 8; it can accept in part Amendments Nos 2, 6, 12, 13 and 14.
It rejects Amendments Nos 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 18 and 19.
I know that you fully appreciate the challenges ahead of us: we need to do everything possible to find an acceptable compromise between the co-legislators.
I think that our big challenge is to strike the balance between what we think is desirable and what is achievable or possible.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.

Employment guidelines for 2002/Joint employment report 2001
The next item on the agenda is the report (A5-0360/2001) by Mrs Weiler on behalf of the Committee for Employment and Social Affairs on:
1. the proposal for a Council decision (COM(2001) 511 - C5-0498/2001 - 2001/0208(CNS)) on the guidelines for employment policy measures by the Member States in 2002
and
2. the Commission communication (COM(2001) 438 - C5-0423/2001 - 2001/2168(COS)) on the draft Joint Employment Report 2001.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, employment policy in the EU was successful last year even though not all our ambitious objectives have been achieved.
But the points have been set.
In few other fields do we have to think in the long term as much as in employment policy.
My impression is that the Member States have not only grasped that, but that they are also acting accordingly.
My report takes the same line as that of the Committee, which has kept to it over the past few years.
We have always followed employment processes in the Member States and offered constructive criticism.
I have therefore concentrated this year on some new key points.
The first of these is the new theme of work quality, on which we in Parliament agree with the initiative of the Commission and the Belgian Presidency, which have also made the quality of work a pre-eminent item on the agenda.
We are very keen that this topic should find its way into all policy areas by a kind of mainstreaming.
The second key point is gender equality in the employment market.
Here, too, according to the Commission's figures, we have achieved an improvement.
The proportion of women in employment has increased by 2% in any case, which is of course not enough for us, but it is the right way to go, and also shows the change in the Member States' thinking.
This reorientation also means - and even that was not so simple - that a change of consciousness has taken place, at least in some Member States such as Germany, Greece and Ireland.
A third point is very important to me - the integration and incorporation of disadvantaged groups into the employment market.
This has for some years been an important topic for this Parliament.
In my report, I put forward the argument that employment policy measures should include immigrants as well.
I believe this to be an important area for the future, precisely because we will otherwise be creating new social flashpoints.
I would like finally to mention the area of continuing education.
We had debates in Committee as to whether it made sense to demand a right to continuing education and to direct the national governments to translate it into action.
I believe that, now, of all times, when we are already finding that bottlenecks in certain trades result from too little training and development in the past, such a national right to continuing education would represent the dictates of the hour.
I am, moreover, convinced that we will have achieved it within four or five years.
Why, then, should Parliament not be the trailblazer for once?
National and European targets need to be set if these policy objectives are to be achieved.
There is, I believe, an additional need for more intensive cooperation between enterprises and institutions of higher education than hitherto, in order to facilitate more effective knowledge transfer and more speedily initiate entrepreneurial innovation than has previously been the case.
I appeal also to the Member States, to the Council and to the Belgian Presidency to have the courage to initiate a public debate on employment policy in Europe.
The fact is that we have observed that there is in the national parliaments - with the possible exception of Denmark - and in the regional parliaments and assemblies, still, little or no, discussion of European employment policy.
Even employers' organisations and trade unions, at regional level, do not know of the significance of our debates and resolutions in the European Parliament.
Of course, effective employment policies and coordinated and farsighted economic and financial policies belong together.
I cannot draw a veil over this Parliament's present dissatisfaction with the Council's objectives in this area and with its debates on the subject.
I cannot help thinking that we could do with a bit more courage on the part of the finance ministers on the Ecofin Council, in order to guarantee here, too, the appropriate and proportionate goal for a rational European employment policy, for only then can an offensive for growth and employment in Europe be realised.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is, in our view, the Member States which have the primary task of creating the appropriate framework for more employment.
It goes without saying that the European Union can contribute towards it.
I believe, though, that dialogue between the ministers of the various Member States is particularly important here.
On looking into the matter more closely, we note that we have in some countries of the European Union almost full employment, but in others unemployment - and, in particular, youth unemployment - on a frightening scale.
I believe it to be a matter of extraordinary importance that the States should learn from one another and avoid making the mistakes already made by others.
We can see that the countries that perform best have created jobs on the basis of a solid financial policy and have got to grips with the necessary structural reforms earlier than others.
We must also ask ourselves the question: who, then, actually creates jobs?
It is not the state, it is often not the major enterprises, which indeed tend rather to retrench.
It is, far more, the small and medium-sized enterprises that create the most jobs.
If we want to be successful, the establishment of new enterprises is especially important.
It is a matter of creating the appropriate framework for them.
We must make it our concern that the European Union is not the institution that contributes to life being even more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises or to making it difficult to set up new ones.
The European Union's activity must focus more on creating the conditions that will give these enterprises a better chance.

Mr President, equality is a prerequisite for economic growth.
Twenty-five million fewer women than men participate in the European labour market.
That is a huge unexploited resource which needs to be made use of if Lisbon' s employment objectives are to be achieved and if economic growth is to be guaranteed.
At the same time, the birth rate is falling dramatically.
Demographic experts predict that Europe' s labour force will consist of considerably fewer people in the future, when more women will therefore have to be in gainful employment and, at the same time, give birth to more children.
How are we to balance the equation?
A basic prerequisite is an equality perspective in all four pillars of the employment policy guidelines, and I am therefore very pleased that Mrs Weiler has been so attentive to the proposals tabled by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities.
The most important thing is perhaps to ensure that European women and men can combine professional life with having a family and children.
The Member States must make child care available and offer parental leave.
The women of Europe must not be forced to choose between professional life and having a family.
The Commission' s focus on better jobs is very encouraging, for better jobs and better working conditions for women are among the prerequisites for having more women in paid employment.
Precarious and low-paid jobs which require little in the way of qualifications and in which women are over-represented at present are hardly going to attract women.
Quality, which is the recurring theme in the guidelines for the year 2000, must also apply to work done by women.
Overcoming gender discrimination at work and in the social insurance systems is a huge challenge.
Discrimination against women in the labour market is not only unproductive, it also ruins the opportunities for individual women, for women as a group and for society as a whole.
Quite simply, growth and human development require us to put an end to gender discrimination.
Equality is an investment.
Mr President, when the experiment of the Luxembourg procedure was set in motion in 1997 and guidelines for Member States' employment policies adopted, it was in the conviction that a favourable climate of economic growth might not alone be sufficient to ensure automatic positive results in employment.
Today, we are confirming this strategy, these undertakings and guidelines in an economic climate which we all know to be much less favourable, or, rather, full of risks, and we are therefore doing so, first and foremost, by duly recognising the need, already established at the Lisbon Summit, to bring the economic policy guidelines adopted at Community level and by the Member States into line with employment policy recommendations and guidelines.
This does not diminish the specific role of the Luxembourg procedure and the economic policy guidelines in the context of what has been defined a coordination process, an open coordination process.
We are aware that these alone are not enough; however, they are, or can be, decisive for maximising the effects or reducing the risks for employment, which are also linked to the economic trend.
All this must be subject to certain conditions, focused on in both the Commission' s proposals, which we judged to be positive, and Parliament' s position.
I will mention them very briefly: we feel that this is a process which warrants careful attention, controls and monitoring.
It is not enough just to state the objectives which are then included under the principle of subsidiarity in national employment plans.
There must also be consistency in terms of effectiveness and implementation: that is why we call for the adoption of auditable, reliable common indicators at Member State as well as Community level, in order to achieve national objectives without whose achievement it would subsequently be difficult to reach our common European and Community objectives.
There must be consistency with budgetary policies at Member State level and at local and regional levels as well; there must be quality employment objectives seeking to combine flexibility, social dialogue, protection, rights and safety, but which also extend beyond that context to include lifelong training, integration policies and employment with a view to increasing the productivity of less elderly workers.
Lastly, and most importantly, there must be equal opportunities policies and active employment policies.
If these conditions are met, the contribution of the Luxembourg procedure will not be the only factor but it will certainly be decisive.
Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Weiler on her report and to thank the Commission for its sustained commitment to the European employment strategy.
No one will now deny that the European employment policy, since it first started in 1997, has led to a certain level of convergence stress in the Member States and has brought with it increasing unanimity as to what an active labour market policy in Europe could be.
That is apparent from the continued refinement of the employment guidelines, although I would add that this is rather unilaterally evident from the first pillar, namely employability, and that the results in the field of adaptability of undertakings still leave something to be desired.
Yet, the moment of truth is now upon us, in my opinion.
In this economic slow-down, Member States must prove that the Lisbon objectives, being sustainable growth, full employment and quality of jobs, were not simply prescribed for periods of boom, but must also remain applicable now.
That means that the Member States will need to lend a hand, for at the same time, I have noticed that a number of cracks are starting to show in the employment strategy.
First of all, I have noticed that people have cold feet about laying down specific, let alone European, objectives and benchmarks.
For example, I think it is great that the Council has recognised that equal opportunities for men and women is a question of social justice as well as economic efficiency.
However, I should also like to see the Council go the extra mile by formulating clear, quantitative and specific objectives in terms of reducing the wage gap and setting up a number of child care centres.
Commissioner, I hope that you will be monitoring this closely.
Secondly, with regard to the mix of policy measures, the method of open coordination is an interesting policy instrument in areas where Europe previously had nothing to say, and I very much applaud the fact that the Belgian Presidency has included the aspect of quality of employment.
Commissioner, it seems obvious to me, however, that collective agreements as well as social legislation will be needed in different areas where the social dialogue has failed.
That is why it is of the utmost importance for my group, for example, to know whether the European Commission will, after the failure of social consultation, produce a draft directive on temporary employment.
Indeed, temporary employment can create new opportunities.
However, for temporary employment to be quality employment which offers social rights, trade union rights, right to training and, at the same time, guarantees for permanent staff in the firms making use of their services, a European directive must be compiled which offers a number of warranties, warranties which have, inter alia, been presented in the joint declaration recently concluded by Euro-CIETT and UNI-EUROPA and that include, for example, equal treatment at temporary employment agencies and at firms making use of their services.
Commissioner, following on from this debate, I should like to know when you will be presenting this draft directive to Parliament and in what way these essential basic conditions will be met.
Mr President, I, too, wish to congratulate Mrs Weiler on her report.
I very much agree with her remark about the significance of training and the importance of making a special effort on behalf of older people in the labour market.
I do not agree that we, in the EU, should have a directive granting any rights, but I well understand that many in this House want to see special emphasis and importance given to actually ensuring a right to training.
However, this is something which the individual countries must take care of.
The employment guidelines provide, of course, both some political priorities and some political objectives, and they also provide a framework for deciding which funds are to be used in order to achieve the objectives.
The funds are allocated to four pillars.
The unemployed must be made better qualified to obtain jobs. They must be given more incentives to get into employment.
That is the first pillar. Secondly, entrepreneurship must be promoted so that we see more companies and jobs created, partly through the removal of constricting regulations and bureaucratic arrangements.
Thirdly, adaptability and flexibility must be promoted so that companies become more competitive. And fourthly, more opportunities must be provided for combining working life and family life so that there is a real opportunity for women to achieve equality in the labour market, leading to an improvement in the employment situation where women are concerned.
Many points have been registered under the four pillars, and I believe we are coming to a point at which it is worth considering whether we are pinning too much on this process, for the more objectives we add to the process, the more we are also in danger of watering down the cooperation and perhaps losing sight of the real goals, namely those of creating more jobs and getting the unemployed into work.
That being said, I am very pleased that, this time, we have obtained an innovation in the guidelines for the year 2000, whereby local and regional efforts are to be involved and local and regional employment strategies developed.
I also believe this underlines the fact that the Commission will need resources for carrying out analyses and studies within this area.
Several days ago, a leading French newspaper ran a headline story on the efforts bring made to combat rising unemployment and it described the wave of near-panic sweeping through the announcements of poor unemployment figures.
At times like these, when a recession may be looming, we find it even more regrettable that employment is not the main priority of the economic and monetary guidelines.
I would like to reiterate that the Group of the Greens believes that employment policy cannot only have the function of monitoring or softening the peaks and troughs of the globalised economy by creating safety nets, by helping those who are out of work to find their way back into the job market. This is all the Luxembourg process has achieved, it is also, evidently, all that the guidelines proposed by the Commission for 2002 are likely to achieve, and is also all that the Weiler report, which is part of this approach, can achieve.
Whilst expressing regret that the Member States did little in response to their invitation to set objectives for unemployment levels, the Commission and the Council have quite rightly placed the emphasis on verifying the qualitative impact of the policies implemented.
In order to clarify this approach, we are proposing two amendments. The first proposes to draw up comparable statistics on the various types of employment, in other words, including underemployment, partial unemployment, and to assess the consequences of so-called employment incentive measures in terms of enhanced social inclusion or exclusion.
Our second amendment proposes to strengthen the action of employment monitoring services in order to prevent flexible short-term contracts being abused.
We must, as a matter of urgency, curb the development of poverty, lack of job security, and unpleasant working conditions.
We still need to introduce a policy to create businesses and jobs.
Instead of despairing over poor growth forecasts as if these were gloomy weather reports, we should try to shape this policy in accordance with our objectives on social and territorial cohesion, and decide on, for example, the necessary large-scale investments, including public investment, draw up a European job creation policy, and not simply a work placement policy.
Mr President, I, too, want to thank Mrs Weiler for a good report.
The Commission reports on which this debate is based presuppose that there are to be no major changes this year, because a large-scale evaluation of the first five-year period is to be carried out in the course of next year. We do not, therefore, wish to start making changes at the present stage.
Naturally, this state of affairs has also had a marked influence upon the current report, which concerns what we have discussed in previous years.
I think that the rapporteur has added some important aspects: quality at work, training, professional education, life long learning, equality etc. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs submitted a number of proposals for the report, of which a number were adopted and introduced into the report.
These amendments worry me because some of them place such heavy emphasis upon price stability policy, budget restriction policy and such like.
They worry me because we are heading for an economy which is no longer as strong.
The Luxembourg procedure has been very focused upon improving the supply of labour, but this presupposes that there are job opportunities and that current economic policy is creating job opportunities and countering the trend towards economic recession.
I therefore believe that, in the current situation, the amendments in question militate against a European employment strategy.
I should also like to say a few words about the future.
A number of evaluations are now under way.
I have been in contact with people working on a number of the ongoing research projects, and I believe that one of the things that will be emphasised is the fact that the Member States are failing to implement the policy properly.
There is relatively broad agreement between those pursuing labour market policy in the Member States but, in spite of that, no such policy is being implemented in the Member States themselves.
The labour market administrations really do not have much to do with the procedure itself. They are pursuing their own policy.
The parliaments have no influence at all, but it is nonetheless they who must fund the national efforts we are demanding.
It is therefore incredibly important that more attention be paid to the parliaments in particular, but also to the entire political process in the Member States, if the result is to be effective.
I believe that this will be the major task in the forthcoming evaluation.
It is not enough simply to emphasise indicators and such like. The bodies that supply the finance and then administer the measures must also play an active role in the process.
Mr President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to address Mrs Weiler's report.
She has identified unemployment as one of the most serious economic and social problems faced by the European Union.
This was true prior to 11 September.
It has now become an even more stark reality in the aftermath and against the background of continuing economic uncertainty which results from war.
One in 12 EU citizens is unemployed today.
This is an intolerable situation and one which is of great concern to all of us.
Indeed, unemployment rates are much higher in some Member States.
Solving the problem of unemployment requires active labour market measures.
Labour markets do not always function efficiently, and Member States must be prepared to take up their responsibilities when the need arises.
The Luxembourg process of employment guidelines is intended to give the Member States a powerful stimulus in shaping their employment policies.
In the short time available to me I want to focus on recent events, but firstly I want to say that a number of key European industries are facing unprecedented difficulties.
Every effort must be made to secure the maximum number of jobs.
Hardest hit at the moment is the airline industry but we must not forget the tourist industry which has already suffered greatly this year from foot-and-mouth disease.
In the case of the Irish national airline, Aer Lingus, 40% of their business and 60% of their profits are generated on trans-Atlantic routes.
Ireland's location as an island state in the north-west periphery of the Union creates a particular set of circumstances to which I would urge the Commission to give full consideration.
The collapse of Aer Lingus simply cannot be permitted.
The economic and social consequences would be unparalleled in any other Member State in the Union, and the knock-on effects to related industries would be enormous.
The fact that we are an island state without any linkage to the rest of Europe means that we require this.
The Commission must look at this sympathetically and favourably.
Mr President, I do not wish to make any profession of political faith in the many detailed proposals to be found in the report and in the Commission' s proposal for a Council decision.
By far the majority of these are to be welcomed and are politically correct, and many are in response to urgent needs, especially the conclusions of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, which Mrs Theorin has reported on.
However, I have some general remarks on employment policy and the EU' s labour market policy which have, of course, been an overriding theme of a number of reports and proposals here this afternoon.
First of all, I have a remark to make about the reality as it is perceived.
There is, of course, a very big gap between the reports of various kinds and the social reality.
Armchair manifestos are largely absurd descriptions of social reality and will be completely unrecognisable to Europe' s enormous army of unemployed and socially excluded.
A similar remove from reality is reflected in quite a few places in this report.
We see this, for example, in recital F, which emphatically opposes the attitude that 'labour market considerations are subordinated to economic policy' .
The Treaty' s convergence requirements and such like may, upon examination, perhaps be seen as wishful thinking, but the only problem is that the Treaty is out of step with reality.
The other remark I have to make is that employment policy and labour market policy, in general, consist, in large measure, of just such political confessions of faith.
On the one hand, this means that we are operating in an area where what is decided is not legally binding, and this, of course, gives free rein to a lot of fine words and good intentions.
On the other hand, we are, to a large extent, in areas for which the Treaty provides no legal bases for proper legal regulation. What, however, there is, at present, no legal base for, there may in future be a legal base for.
I am thinking, for example, of the reference to harmonisation of social arrangements, of tax policy etc. However, I would remind you that, in Denmark, we have a saying about all good intentions, to the effect that 'the way to hell is paved with good intentions' .
Mr President, we all stand for a higher level of employment, indeed for full employment.
But how?
There are considerable differences in how we answer the question as to how we want to achieve this objective.
Many advocate, to the exclusion of all else, additional measures for employees, but that alone cannot reach the goal.
We must indeed implement measures to benefit both employers and employees - or transpose such measures, as the case may be.
This means, though, that we, together, have to be consistent in ensuring that there is a durable improvement in the economic conditions for our small and medium-sized businesses.
Two-thirds of all European workers are employed in them.
Their productive capacity must be improved, and that by means of easier access to additional finance on more favourable terms and a distinct reduction in the tax burden.
Mr President, unemployment is the most serious problem facing our European national economies.
Young people, women, older people and people with disabilities have a particularly hard time of it.
There is a lack of access to training, vocational and continuing education, retraining and, of course, work itself.
Society's weaker members must, though, be strengthened in a spirit of solidarity.
Mrs Weiler is right to draw attention to the 1997 Luxembourg Summit.
The Member States have been showing their true colours since the guidelines on employment policy appeared.
Progress has been made in lifelong learning, in the application of practices which have proved their worth, in the involvement of both sides of industry and in action plans for local and regional employment.
Above all, though, incentives for active jobseeking and for investment in research and development, the reduction of the tax burden on work and structural reforms are all still lacking.
In this report, I do not find long-term strategies, but rather feverish measures for dealing with periods of slack growth.
Not everything can be blamed on the tragic events of 11 September.
Predictions of growth must be substantially adjusted, for example Germany's from 3% in January to 0.75% this week.
Chancellor Schröder will not reach his goal of reducing the number of unemployed to 3.5 million in the election year, since the figure is expected to shoot up to 3.8 million.
His famous steady hand is trembling.
An additional EUR 2.5 billion will be required for unemployment benefit and for the Federal Institute for Employment.
If Germany, the engine of growth, falters, the whole of the European Union will be affected.
It is high time that there were financial concessions for SMEs.
Taxes must not be raised still further, especially at a low point in the economic cycle.
Tax reforms must be brought forward and the Member States must become more active in the fight against the black economy and tax evasion.
I urge both sides of industry to make employment contracts more flexible and further modernise the organisation of work.
In doing this, I am counting on the expertise and commitment of responsible managers and employees.
Mr President, I should also like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for an excellent report.
When we look back at the very short period during which we have worked on employment policy within the EU, we have to note that it has been relatively successful.
The level of employment has increased and unemployment has gone down, and that is indeed progress.
Now that the economy is in decline, the moment of truth has, however, arrived, and I believe that the need for a coordinated employment policy is even greater than before.
Even though the situation is encouraging now, we still see shortcomings, such as women' s low share of the labour market.
It is not just that women' s share of that market is much lower than men' s.
Rather, women are over-represented when it comes to atypical and precarious jobs in the labour market, even in countries which have a very high proportion of women in gainful employment.
As has been observed in recent years, there are also problems when it comes to the older workforce.
It is really a pity that such a small proportion of the population between the ages of 55 and 65 are in work.
In this area, a range of measures relating to the working environment, skill development etc. is needed if we are going to be able to increase these figures.
There are also very large regional differences and, for groups such as immigrants and the disabled, levels of employment are still very low.
I welcome the discussion about quality at work and about not only creating more job opportunities but also increasing the quality of those jobs.
In this area, a long list of measures is, however, required.
That applies, of course, to the working environment, and especially to the new problems arising in the working environment in connection with people being stressed, excluded, burned out and such like. It also applies, however, to the issue of life long learning.
I believe that this is perhaps the most central issue if we are to be able to obtain economic growth and create more employment opportunities in the future, and that is why I am supporting this universal right.
I genuinely want to see a framework agreement at European level in which the social partners agree to this right. I do not know whether that is possible.
Otherwise, the Commission will have to act. However, it would be the best solution.
This right to skill development must then be adapted at national level within different sectors.
Finally, a view of the open coordination method. The open coordination method exists parallel to legislation in the areas of employment law and the working environment.
The open coordination method is good, but is lacking in the areas of democratic control and transparency.
We must free the European Parliament to exercise influence on this process. The open coordination method has grown in importance over the course of a long period of time.
It has operated relatively well, but there is a lack of democratic control.

Mr President, I join with Mrs Weiler in many of her assessments and conclusions, and also consider much of what has been presented by the Commission to represent definite progress.
Mrs Weiler, I would like to express my congratulations to you on this work, but also wish to point out three major problems that I find in the real world, which is not quite as rosy as it is depicted in some of the Commission's assessments or, indeed, in this report.
First among them is the strategy of full employment by 2010 on the basis of a 3% growth rate.
I found that illusory from the very start.
The problem with it, though, is that other ways of combating unemployment have been disregarded.
It is lamentable that even Social Democrats stay aloof if you advocate the reduction of working hours.
Scant regard is paid to elements of a third economic sector for social, ecological and cultural services or indeed to the greening of society.
The second problematic aspect - one to which Mr Andersson has just referred - is the split development of employment policy.
There are, of course, some positive trends.
Full employment in engineering and in technical and managerial occupations has increased.
Modernisation really does have winners.
The other side of the coin is, though, a clear increase in part-time employment, especially of women, among whom it has now reached 45.7%. in the EU.
The third problem is this: you have addressed the issue of the quality of work but, in my opinion, the social content of work is largely disregarded.
The law on employment contracts is 'made more flexible' but in reality it is relaxed.
We see the promotion of the low-wage sector.
The right of the long-term unemployed to choose their work is being limited.
It is precisely because these things are naturally long-term phenomena that we are, I believe, obliged to act with sensitivity in taking precautions, so that no new social division arises.
Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Weiler, on the quality of her report.
This House has been an enthusiastic supporter of the quantitative objectives laid down at the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils with regard to the overall rate of employment, the rate of female employment and the rate of employment amongst the elderly.
Unemployment, as has already been said, is one of the most serious economic and social problems the European Union faces and, currently, one in twelve citizens is unemployed, with the worst-affected groups being women, young people, the elderly, the disabled and members of ethnic minorities.
The 2002 guidelines for employment must be accompanied in all aspects by qualitative objectives, hence the importance of adopting special measures for incentives and action in the field of economic and social cohesion for the least-developed regions which lack the appropriate structures.
One pillar of the employment strategy, the entrepreneurial spirit, calls for priority to be given to the creation and growth of SMEs, which have enormous potential for job creation, as we can see from the most recent data from Eurostat, which shows that micro-enterprises with between one and nine workers made the greatest increase in terms of job creation in the European Union.
The report quite rightly highlights reducing bureaucratic and tax obligations as a means of stimulating the creation and growth of companies.
Nevertheless, we must reiterate that active support must be provided for the creation of infrastructures to support research and development, vocational training and lifelong learning so as to ensure the quality and continuity of employment.
We all know that the European Union will only become a knowledge-based economy if all Member States make investment in human resources their absolute priority.
While the European Parliament deliberates on a report on employment policy, a report that sings the praises of competition, and claims that the social market economy has proved its worth, this same market economy has recently claimed a further 4 000 victims, 4 000 Moulinex workers who now find themselves jobless.
I am citing the example of Moulinex, because the decision has just been taken. I could, however, cite dozens of other businesses scattered throughout Europe, from Philips to Siemens, as well as several airlines.
This is a tragedy for many thousands of employees, and a disaster for the regions that are affected.
I would like to express my solidarity with the workers of these companies and my indignation at the attitude of their bosses, who have become wealthy on the back of the workers. The latter are made to pay for their bosses' economic blunders, and they are now jobless, have no wages coming in, sometimes after they have been in employment for many years.
These workers have reaped no benefits whatsoever from their companies' periods of prosperity, and in no way are they responsible for their difficulties.
Both governments and the European institutions are helping to prolong this despicable situation, where workers are suffering to enable company owners to safeguard their assets.
The money needed to finance jobs must be deducted from the wealth accumulated by shareholders, past and present, and from the resources held by banks.
Without this political will, these great promises on employment policy are nothing more than idle talk.
So, I warn you, workers will not let themselves be pushed around forever; the greed of their bosses and the policies that favour their employers will eventually cause social upheaval.
This is what will require a genuine employment policy, as it is this alone that will force those who have made their fortune on the back of others to shoulder their responsibilities.
Mr President, further to the present evaluation of the employment process, I should like to draw the attention of the Commission, and of Parliament too, of course, to two points.
First of all, there is the method of coordination itself.
It has become a popular method in the social sector with regard to a number of themes which fall within national competence but which create common problems across all European countries.
It is therefore possible to put forward common goals.
However, Commissioner, the success of the method, given the fact that it is not a binding mechanism, relies on the moral and political pressure that can be exerted.
Media attention plays an essential role in this.
The employment process based on the open coordination method has now been running for some five years, and a dramatic decline has been noticed in the level of attention given to this.
Media attention has waned and, as a result of this, there has been less pressure on national governments to take serious account of the objectives and of the annual criticism levelled by the Council and Commission at their national action plans.
The open coordination method is only successful insofar as convergence stress continues to exist, and efforts will need to be made in order to sustain its existence.
The question therefore arises as to how the pressure can be kept up.
In my opinion, this should be one of the crucial points in the evaluation.
The second point is best practices.
The different reports include best practices for national Member States.
The question is: to what extent is a policy being adopted to actually learn something from those best practices?
How many Member States have visited projects in other Member States?
How many best practices have been discussed in the different Member States?
It is one of the methods, even if the pressure subsides, to keep the employment policy going.
I would therefore ask for both these points to be looked at in the evaluation.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 tomorrow.
Exposure of workers to risks arising from physical agents
The next item on the agenda is the recommendation for Second Reading (A5-0320/2001) by Mrs Thorning-Schmidt on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Common Position of the Council [7914/1/2001 - C5-0293/2001 - 1992/0449(COD)] with reference to the adoption of the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on minimum requirements to protect the health and safety of workers from physical hazards (vibrations) (16th individual directive under Article 16 (1) of Directive 89/391/EEC).
Mr President, the Council of Ministers has presented a common position on mechanical vibrations. There are a great many good things in the common position.
The best is that agreement on a compromise has been successfully reached in the Council.
This means that there is now broad recognition of the fact that vibrations constitute a health risk, when it comes both to hand/arm vibrations and whole-body vibrations.
It is also good that all three institutions appear to be in agreement as to a method of limiting these vibrations.
The key to this method is the parallel introduction of action values and limit values that should never be exceeded. In the Committee reading, we talked a lot about the limit values.
That is really rather a pity, however, for it is in actual fact the action values that are the most important for, when the action values are exceeded, the employer is obliged to do something and to take preventative action to change the way in which the work is organised.
It is precisely this method which offers flexibility and emphasises prevention rather than injunctions.
Moreover, I find it very annoying that it is precisely this flexibility and the emphasis on prevention that have not been recognised at all by the opponents of the proposal here in Parliament.
That is a great pity, in view of the fact that they themselves often talk about flexibility and prevention rather than injunctions.
However, there are, unfortunately, also less happy facets of this proposal by the Council of Ministers.
The Commission' s original proposal has been weakened in a number of ways, and it has therefore been necessary to table some amendments.
I will go through a couple of them.
Amendment No 1 is a reminder that we still do not have the directives concerning the remaining physical agents.
We know that the Noise Directive is on the way, but we are now waiting impatiently for the latter, and it would be appropriate if, by accepting our amendments, the Commission were, today, to tell us that they are as committed as we are to putting these directives in place.
We have been waiting for many years.
Amendment No 2 is crucial.
As I say, it is good that the Council could agree to set a limit value, but when you consider how high it really is, you can also understand how agreement could have been successfully reached.
The proposed 1.15 m/s2 constitutes a significant weakening of the original proposal.
The report therefore proposes a limit value of 0.8 m/s2.
We know from the internationally recognised ISO standards that it can be said with certainty that there are health risks with exposure of more than 0.8 m/s2.
It therefore makes more sense to set a limit value in which the protection of employees will, in actual fact, be something real. There is no question of any tightening-up.
All that is proposed is a return to the level proposed by the Commission itself at first reading, and there is no new knowledge to justify choosing another limit value.
Some MEPs have repeated again and again that there is not one single proof of the connection between whole-body vibrations and injury.
That is simply not the case, however.
There is a quite clear connection between strong vibrations and injury.
That is something that science is agreed about.
It is true that we cannot put clear figures upon the number of people who will be injured in the case of a specific limit value.
However, that is how it will always be when it is a question of people and their working environment.
In such cases, the precautionary principle must be applied, and this is also something actually laid down in the Treaty.
Amendment No 5 proposes shorter transitional periods than those proposed in the common position.
Clearly, these could be applied in practice out in the real world.
With the common position, however, we should arrive at transitional periods of up to 12 years, and it makes almost no sense to legislate for such long periods.
Finally, on behalf of my own Group of the Party of European Socialists and of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I have tabled an amendment that makes it possible to exempt agriculture and forestry from the limit values for whole-body vibrations.
We have arrived at a compromise whereby agriculture and forestry, like aviation and shipping, are given the opportunity to be exempt from these limit values for whole-body vibrations.
We have done this because we remained doubtful as to whether agriculture could, in fact, comply with these conditions.
Allow me to emphasise two things in this connection.
First of all, I think that the farming industry' s impact assessments have been very exaggerated and therefore not to be taken seriously.
It has been maintained that farmers would only be able to work for two hours a day.
That, I think, is wrong.
I believe in actual fact that, in preparing the assessments, it has been forgotten that the directive only applies to employees and not to people who are self-employed.
The second thing it is important to state is that this compromise proposal does not mean that we are giving up combating harmful vibrations within agriculture.
It simply means choosing another method, and it is worth emphasising that the action values must go on being maintained.
I hope that the Commission and the Council will respond positively to our proposal.
I also hope that we shall obtain wide support for the proposals here in the House.
The text before us is balanced and reasonable and fulfils the main purpose of this directive, namely to ensure flexibility in the workplace at the same time as ensuring that employees are guaranteed the necessary protection against harmful vibrations in the workplace.
Mr President, the proposal for a directive which is before us for its second reading, falls within the scope of measures that aim to improve the safety and health of workers. As you know, this is an objective that Parliament quite rightly considers very important.
We must, however, find a fair balance between, on the one hand, the need to protect the health and safety of workers and, on the other hand, the need to prevent this directive from placing excessive burdens on companies and particularly on small- and medium-sized enterprises.
If we adopt overly restrictive exposure limit values, it could, in practice, and technically speaking, turn out to be extremely difficult to abide by them; it could actually harm the interests of workers, either because this could lead to their working time being limited to two hours per day, or because if the limit values are not applied, the protection they do have could be significantly reduced.
Since this report only concerns the issue of vibrations, we must also take into account the delicate and hard-won agreement between the various national requirements, and we must not impose further excessive restrictions on the sectors and industries concerned.
And in this respect, I would like to say that our Committee was not able to complete its work due to an incredibly busy timetable.
We were unable to interview all the relevant people involved before the deadline, and this is something I regret.
For these reasons, our group believes that the amendments adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are a relatively acceptable compromise between the requirement for the protection of workers and on the competitiveness of European industry.
Nevertheless, our group considers that it is essential to include the derogation option for the agricultural and forestry sectors, since the current arrangements for servicing and replacing machinery in these sectors would not enable exposure limit values to be effectively applied.
On a personal note, and particularly with regard to the work that we did last week, I would lastly like to thank Mrs Thorning-Schmidt for her cooperation.
Mrs Diamantopoulou, I hope that this spirit of openness, as part of our conciliation work with the Council, will enable us to agree on a halfway point so that the directive can be adopted within a reasonable timeframe.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, for the tremendous grasp she has demonstrated of this highly technical subject both in committee and in plenary.
My father and his brothers and, in fact, all the male members of my family worked in the coalmines in the northeast of England and most of them have received compensation for both industrial white finger, which is caused by hand-arm vibration, and industrial deafness.
This proposal concerning physical agents is a very real proposal to me.
Vibration has been a major problem in the past.
But it still is, and that is demonstrated by the very strenuous lobbying on all Members of this House from various sectors of industry in relation to this proposal.
I would like to echo what the rapporteur has said about the other elements of the original physical agents' directive.
Noise, the original directive of 1986, was due to be reviewed in 1991.
Here we are, ten years later, and no revision to the existing legislation on noise has been made.
On optical radiation, industrial lasers were in their infancy when the original proposal was brought forward.
They are now in widespread use and we need to update or introduce law at European level on that subject in regard to fields and waves.
We are increasingly bombarded by fields and waves of all types and all intensities in our homes and workplaces.
That is set to increase radically as a result of developments such as the new bluetooth standard.
All of those outstanding elements are becoming increasingly urgent, and I hope the Commission will continue its good work to break the impasse that has so far existed inside the Council.
The rapporteur has introduced a number of important amendments in her report, but probably among the most important is Amendment No 2 concerning whole-body vibration.
Amendment No 2 represents a compromise, it lies between the Commission's original proposal and the common position, and I hope it will receive the support of the House.
We have received strenuous lobbying, particularly on whole-body vibration.
There is general consensus on the need to act on hand-arm vibration, but industrial lobbyists have worked hard to convince Members that there is no link between whole-body vibration and injury.
I know for a fact that the Commission has at least 17 box-files of evidence showing causality between exposure to whole-body vibration and injury.
The difficulty is in untangling what proportion of the injury is due directly to whole-body vibration and what proportion is due to other factors such as poor ergonomics or bad posture.
There is a causal link and there is a need to act.
I hope we will see support for the rapporteur on that issue.
The rapporteur has also mentioned a compromise to exclude agriculture.
It proved necessary to introduce such a compromise; the exclusion would be for five years if it does come to pass.
I would have preferred that it did not occur, but it had to happen to secure political consensus here for today's vote.
If it is agreed, the Commission must not do its usual trick of waiting the full five years before assessing the scientific evidence and bringing forward a proposal.
The preparatory work needs to be done to move quickly once that five years has expired.
What, then, we are aiming for and will continue to seek to achieve in conciliation, beyond the debate and vote today, is a balance between action levels and limit values which it will be possible for industry to accept and implement but will at the same time drive forward improved engineering to eliminate vibration from new equipment and improve the way in which ergonomic considerations are taken into account.
I hope the report will be supported today.
I am going to deal specifically with whole-body vibration.
As has already been said, there is evidence that whitefinger can be caused by hand-arm vibration, but I do not believe that there is sufficient evidence that whole body vibration causes tremendous health risks for workers.
There is a slight health risk, but even the ISO standards say that there is no quantitative health risk, and so without further scientific evidence, I think it would be crazy for us to put more burdens on industry.
I am glad that the rapporteur has eventually agreed that we need a compromise on agriculture, so I urge you all to vote for Amendment No 11.
This would exclude agriculture and forestry for five years and then it would come back to Parliament after further research and scientific evidence has been provided.
If we do not vote for the compromise in Amendment No 11, I believe that the harvest across the whole of the EU will not be able to take place.
If we do not vote for it, tractor drivers, for instance, will be able to drive their tractor for between 2 to 4 hours in any 8 hour period and that is if we get the 0.8 m/s2 that the rapporteur is suggesting.
Even if agriculture and forestry is taken back, we need to go back to the common position of 1.15 m/s2 instead of the 0.8 that the rapporteur is proposing, because if we do not go back to that, other parts of the industry such as engineering, mining, construction will have tremendous problems, so I urge you to make sure that you do not vote to put more restrictions on industry when we do not have a quantitative health risk demonstrated.
I hereby beg you not to vote for the rapporteur's position on this and to go back to the common position and vote for Amendment No 11 and against Amendments Nos 2, 4, 12 and 9.
Mr President, in my opinion, the rapporteur has done sterling work.
I have been active in an advisory role vis-à-vis works councils, trade unions and industry concerning conditions at work, among other things.
I have observed that, for some fifteen years, we in the Netherlands - but that also applies to other Member States in terms of best practices - have been working with the ISO Standard 2631, as recommended and followed by Mrs Thorning-Schmidt.
Only at the end did we decide to adopt the amendment by Mrs Hermange.
I actually agree that we should not simply consider the views of industry.
There are also other angles to be considered.
For example, the trade unions have stated that this is not simply a matter of exposure from a health perspective, but also a matter of symptoms of fatigue, for example.
Consequently, the standard should, from the point of view of safety - or, rather, the lack of this - actually be stricter than is now the case.
I have not yet heard this aspect mentioned here, and it should actually help us find a happy medium.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Thorning-Schmidt on her excellent work and, having said this, I would like to remind you that Article 31(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union states that every worker has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity.
This is a wide-ranging declaration, within the chapter on solidarity, which includes not only the measures taken against obvious risks, such as the risk of falling or risks faced when dealing with abrasive materials, but also those preventative measures used against risks that could go undetected by the majority of those who are not experts in this field.
These are the risks that those who work in mines, in construction and in the field of transport have to face on a daily basis, which, according to those who study them, affect up to 24% of European workers.
These risks originate from two different types of vibration: Hand-arm vibration, which is the cause of whitefinger, impaired feeling and grip, amongst other problems, or Whole-body vibration, which is the cause of back problems, lumbar pains and slipped discs.
It is worth remembering, Commissioner, that these measures should not be limited to including only physical causes, such as vibrations, but should also take account of electromagnetic fields, noise and waves and optical radiation, for example, and also bear in mind the transitional period needed to make the required adjustments arising from the adoption of these measures.
I am convinced that all employers and workers have a common goal, which is the improvement of their workspace and environment, so that the place in which they work is suitable.
A transitional period will be needed so that equipment can be replaced and procedures can be improved and adapted. Differences relating to technological development and type of activity, such as agriculture, will have to be taken into account, with a conviction that 'no-risk' does not exist and that the quest for safety is the responsibility of all those involved: workers, be they self-employed or employed, employers or local, regional or national administrations.
Mr President, in my two years in this Parliament I have never received such a barrage of letters of complaint as I have about this report.
I am talking particularly about whole-body vibration aspects, rather than hand and arm vibration.
These comments are not just from employers, large and small, in farming, quarrying, mining, engineering and construction businesses - to name but a few - who are rightly concerned about the very viability of their entire industries under these proposals. They are also from ordinary employees concerned about their jobs if the rapporteur's amendments go through.
Recently published and well-respected scientific work from Germany, Italy and the UK, as well as the rapporteur's own country of Denmark, shows no direct quantifiable link between whole-body vibration and back pain.
I note that Mr Hughes maintains otherwise; not for the first time his own government disagrees with him.
The above comments from constituents have two things in common: their anger that Socialist MEPs should be proposing such amendments in the first place, and their sheer disbelief that such MEPs could be so out of touch with reality.
Let me be clear.
The above comments are nothing to do with health and safety, issues which all of us recognise as important.
They are everything to do with the rapporteur jumping to conclusions that are not supported by specific scientific evidence.
The UK government is strongly opposed to the rapporteur's proposed amendments which, it maintains, would damage industry and agriculture for no benefit.
UK Conservative MEPs agree, and we urge the UK Labour MEPs, who supported this report so resolutely in committee, now to support the common position, and meanwhile to support our compromise, tabled jointly by a number of political groups.
I urge you all to join us in voting for sound science and sound sense.
Mr President, this is really one of the worst pieces of legislation I have seen in this Parliament.
The benefits it offers are vague and speculative - they are unproven and unquantified, but the costs are real, immediate and massive.
Credible estimates suggest that the costs of implementation in the UK alone could range between EUR 15 and 30 billion.
The effects will reach into a wide-range of industries - not only agriculture, but road haulage, construction and many other areas.
I have been contacted by an exceptionally wide-range of business organisations and they are universally opposed to the measure and especially to those amendments which would make it even more repressive.
Those organisations include: the Confederation of British Industry, the National Farmers' Union, the Road Haulage Association, the Quarrying Association, the Coal Industry and JCB, the heavy equipment manufacturer.
It appears that the limit set by the directive would restrict a truck driver to six hours work, a tractor driver to two or three hours and a brush cutter to 15 minutes.
This will do huge damage to European economies.
It will cost jobs.
It has been pointed out that the average jogger exceeds the limit by a factor of 7 or 8, while even walking down a road could break the rules.
I suspect that I was over the limit on Monday on the bus from Basle Airport to Strasbourg!
The directive also places huge new costs and administrative burdens on industry in terms of measuring vibration levels and recording exposure.
There is a crying need, Mr President, for proper regulatory impact assessments to be applied to European legislative proposals.
If that had been done in this case, it would never have got this far. Any possible benefits are far outweighed by the costs.
It appears that we cannot reject the whole proposal, but I appeal to colleagues to support amendments which would soften it and to reject amendments which would make it even more disastrous than it already is.
Mr President, on behalf of the Commission I would like to congratulate Mrs Thorning-Schmidt for her excellent report particularly because it is such a difficult technical issue: It is not only that is a difficult dossier, but it has been before the Council since 1994 and only now are things on the move.
I consider that this legislation on vibrations will be a fundamental step to achieving better protection of the health and safety of workers exposed to risks arising from physical agents, but of course, we have to take into account the economic impact, the impact in the enterprises - the small, medium and large.
That is why we propose a step-by-step approach.
We cannot forget that a considerable number of workers suffer from the effects of their exposure to vibrations, notably neurological, vascular and musculo-skeletal disorders.
This is a particularly serious problem which is costly for business and society and which, more importantly, causes suffering for the people directly involved as well as for their families, and when we discuss costs, we must calculate the cost that enterprises have because of the health problems of their workers.
On your amendments, the Commission has worked very hard to maintain a high level of protection while, at the same time, ensuring that a compromise could be reached.
Although we consider that lower values more in line with the amended proposal would be more appropriate, we have accepted the Council's common position with a view to achieving a global compromise.
The common position increases the exposure limit values and exposure action values for the whole-body vibrations and introduces new provisions on transitional periods for existing work equipment in general and for equipment used in the agricultural and forestry sectors in particular.
For reasons of consistency, the Commission cannot therefore accept Amendment No 2, which decreases the exposure values for whole-body vibrations in the common position, nor the part of Amendment No 5 which reduces the length of the transitional periods.
However, the last part of Amendment No 5 would be acceptable if slightly redrafted.
Similarly, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 8 and 12 because they merely restate the principles of the employer's responsibility already contained in the Framework Directive without additional added value, nor Amendments Nos 9 and 13 since they either remove the possibility for Member States to grant derogations on whole-body vibrations in case of seasonal work or simply allow for the averaging of exposures which is already considered by the ISO standards to which the directive refers.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 11 for both technical and political reasons.
Although the Commission agrees with the principles behind the changes proposed by Amendment No 1, we can only agree with the first part but we cannot accept the second part which foresees the commitment of both the European Parliament and the Council to continue with the adoption of other parts of the original physical agents proposal.
This is not a question of political disagreement. This part of the recital contravenes the rule that the recitals 'shall not contain normative provisions or political exhortations'.
I accept Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 7.
These amendments clearly improve and clarify the text.
I regret that I have to reject Amendment No 6 as it stands.
Nevertheless, I could accept the idea of justifications to be provided by Member States on any transitional periods or derogations granted by them.
This should however be integrated in Article 14 (1).
Finally, let me remind you that the step-by-step approach we have used, starting with vibrations, implies that we should now push ahead with the remaining three physical agents included in the Commission's original proposal: noise, electromagnetic fields and optical radiation.
To conclude, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 7.
It can accept in part Amendments Nos 1, 5 and 6 and it rejects Amendments Nos 2, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 13.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
Ladies and gentlemen, to judge by what I am hearing now, I think we will soon be needing a new Directive on noise in the Chamber during a debate!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon today.
Mr President, I wanted to ask you about the decision of the Bureau that was taken last night on the issue of a Staff Regulation.
I want to know on what basis that decision was taken.
I think that the House should be reminded that when the present Commission was accepted, it was accepted on the basis of the need for radical reform.
A decision was taken by the Bureau last night to adopt a rather more cautious approach than the one that has been adopted in plenary, but we did not want as in the past, we wanted a radical overhaul.
I wish to know why the Bureau has gone against the spirit of what was accepted in the plenary both on the van Hulten report and on the Harbour report and why, given the critical importance and interinstitutional nature of this issue, the Vice-President for Reform, Commissioner Kinnock, was not invited to speak at that meeting.
Could you, Mr President, give me an assurance that the Bureau will look at this again and also invite the Vice-President of the Commission to speak to the Bureau in order to amend the letter that was agreed last night?
I was at the Bureau meeting last night and I am not aware that the Bureau actually took any final decisions.
They took a decision to write a letter to Mr Prodi and therefore there are still ongoing discussions on this matter.
At the last part-session, I raised under points of order, this whole question and asked the presidency to give this House a comprehensive report about the state of reform discussions as soon as possible.
So far, we have not had this report and I emphasise here the concerns of my colleague Mrs Morgan.
In my report, that was passed by a very big majority in this House, we set the linear career structure on merit as the centre-piece of the reform.
But it appears from comments being made by one of the Vice-Presidents of this Parliament in the newspapers and not to this House, that the whole issue is now not regarded as important by the Bureau.
I hope I have the support of all colleagues in the House in saying that we still consider this the centre-piece of the reforms and we do not see any reason why Parliament should not follow a similar line to that being taken by the Commission in this crucial area.
The point made by you and by Mrs Morgan will be raised again in the Bureau.
I can assure you that it will be given proper consideration.
Mr President, can we take that as an assurance that no letter will be sent until the Bureau has met again on Thursday, because that is what I think the House would like to hear?
I cannot tell you the status of the letter.
I imagine that it has already been sent, so I cannot say that it will not be sent.
But the matter will be given full discussion when the Bureau meets again tomorrow.
Mr President, can I just object to the fact that the Thorning-Schmidt report and the Ghilardotti report are going to be voted on immediately after the debate?
Some Groups have not had a chance to look at the Ghilardotti report in particular and to debate them.
Can we at least, if this happens in the future, have far more warning?
We only heard last night that this was about to happen when it was too late for us to do anything about it.
This report has been scheduled for today since the agenda was drawn up.
We get a great deal of complaints from the press who say that we do not vote quickly enough after we have had a debate.
Therefore a balance has to be struck.
VOTE
Mr President, I see from Rule 114 of the Rules of Procedure that procedure without debate applies when the committee responsible has not tabled any amendments or when all the amendments for deliberation have been adopted with no more than three Members voting against them.
This report has now come to us without debate, although the Committee took a vote on the Swedish candidate, Mr Tobisson, when more than three Members voted against him because he has no experience as an auditor whatsoever.
For this reason, I would like to hear your interpretation as to whether it is right that this matter can be voted on without debate, without the possibility of openly putting forward these points of view, as more than three Members have voted against a nominee.
I insist this matter be referred to Parliament' s plenary for debate there.
Of course every Member is allowed to vote as they so wish.
You correctly state Rule 114.
The committee has requested that this be put to Parliament.
We are now in a position where the Conference of Presidents approved this being put on the agenda of Parliament at the request of the committee.
Therefore the vote will go ahead.
(In successive votes Parliament adopted the nine resolutions)
Report (A5-0318/2001) by Didier Rod, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a Council recommendation on the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in human medicine (COM(2001) 333 - C5-0411/2001 - 2001/2164(COS))
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, resistance to antimicrobial agents now causes hundreds of thousands of deaths the world over.
Diseases that we thought were under control, such as tuberculosis or the plague, are re-appearing and are posing a serious threat to human health, particularly in developing countries.
We acknowledged, by voting in favour of the Khanbhai report, that resistance to anti-malarial agents was one of the causes of malaria-related deaths.
But we now know that one of the true causes of the current situation in Europe is the incorrect use of antibiotics and over-consumption, not only in the field of human medicine but also in animal feed.
Reports on GMOs also indicate this...
I am sorry to interrupt you, as rapporteur, but it is not correct for a rapporteur to start making a speech before we take a vote.
If you have something pertinent to say about the vote, we will listen to you.
But if it is not to do with voting procedure I suggest to you that, as rapporteur, you have already had your opportunity of speaking to the substance of the debate.
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of appointing nine new members of the Court of Auditors.
All nine candidates are well qualified to become excellent members of the Court of Auditors.
We would nonetheless remind the Member States that, in appointing candidates, they must take Article 247, Paragraph 2 of the Treaty seriously: 'The Members of the Court of Auditors shall be chosen from among persons who belong or have belonged in their respective countries to external audit bodies or who are especially qualified for this office.'
The Court of Auditors plays a very important role in relation to supervising the Community' s funds.
It is therefore very important that there should be enduring respect for its Members.
We have voted on these nine re-appointed and newly appointed members of the Court of Auditors with mixed feelings.
The EP' s role in this instance is marginal, since the Council is the designated institution.
We endorse this distribution of tasks in accordance with the Treaty.
However, the quality of the candidates should be paramount in the EP' s verdict.
We were bitterly disappointed in this respect, both in terms of some of the Member States and in terms of the majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
A few candidates are, in our opinion, clearly not up to the task and, in one instance, do not even meet the Treaty requirements.
A Member State that puts forward a candidate simply on the basis of a long political career, without the relevant candidate having qualifications in the area of accounts, should hang its head in shame.
But also in other areas, the level of candidates was very diverse.
For such a post with high accountability and a huge significance for community funds, only heavyweights in the financial-political arena should be put forward.
Since this has not happened in a few cases, we have given some the benefit of the doubt, but we were unable to give the weakest candidates our vote.
Report Rod (A5-0318/2001):
We shall not discuss the medical arguments put forward in favour of restricting the use of antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents.
However, the report mentions the need to save money on health care costs.
Although this need could, generally, be justified, we nonetheless reject any argument for this.
We know only too well that, when it comes to making savings on medical spending, it is always the health care of the working classes, and particularly the poorest sectors of society, that suffers.
The result of these 'careful recommendations' , which governments usually use as a pretext to take restrictive measures, does nothing to affect the excessive use of medicine by the rich, whilst the poor are deprived of even the most basic levels of care.
We therefore abstained from voting on this report.
Report Schmidt (A5-0324/2001):
Mr President, I have made so many speeches that I have lost my voice.
Maybe I have delivered too many explanations of vote!
I voted for the directive on undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities because one way that pensioners get rich - I am not being serious here - is through reaping the benefit of fruitful savings.
In this way, if their savings bear fruit, as the directive proposes, pensioners will be able to follow the example of the great single-handed circumnavigator, Mr Francis Chichester - the father of our beloved fellow Member, Mr Giles Chichester - who celebrated his sixty-fifth birthday while sailing single-handedly round the world.
Report Jensen (A5-0319/2001):
Mr President, the Pensioners' Party voted for the Jensen report.
I would nevertheless like to tell Commissioner Diamantopoulou, who works so hard to help workers and to increase the number of jobs throughout Europe, that, as representative of the Pensioners' Party, I believe that, if we are to have more jobs, we must reduce the cost of labour: we must, therefore, reduce the cost of pension services and contributions while still increasing the size of pensions.
We want less contributions and larger pensions, and that can only be achieved by careful, sound administration of contributors' money.
. (PT) We have supported this report since its first reading in February 2001.
Its relevance warrants our support once again and this is why we have voted in favour of it.
Developing, programming, monitoring and assessing the European employment strategy with the involvement of the social partners and local and regional authorities are important and essential objectives for fully and effectively achieving the strategic ambitions defined at the Lisbon European Council.
More and better jobs mean greater economic and social cohesion.
It is, therefore, crucial that cooperation between Member States is improved with regard to exchanging experiences and information and identifying best practices in addition to the involvement of the social partners and local and regional authorities, not forgetting the implementation of an active and transparent public information policy that takes account of the public' s requirements for transparency.
One particularly praiseworthy aspect of this report is the attention it pays to the promotion of equal opportunities for men and women in the employment and labour markets.
Undertaking studies on the provision of childminding structures and of home assistance and care services is an essential instrument for assessing shortcomings in this field, initially and then putting into practice, in a later stage, an action plan designed to enable people to reconcile their professional lives with their family lives.
With regard to the budget and annual appropriations, we agree with the rapporteur' s position and fully support it.
Report Ghilardotti (A5-0325/2001):
Mr President, I voted for the Ghilardotti report.
Keeping employees informed is a very good thing, Mr President, but I tried substituting the word 'pensioners' for the word 'employees.
The result is a wonderful report: the European Union calls for pensioners to be kept better informed; the European Union wants improved consultation of pensioners.
The pensioners would be happy to know that there is a report addressing the issue of more information and consultation for pensioners, for it is still the case today that some European pensioners do not even know how large their pension will be the day before they start to draw it, they do not know at what age they will be able to retire and they find the documents presented to them totally incomprehensible.
I therefore hope that I will soon be able to vote in favour of consulting and informing pensioners as well as employees.

This particular proposal can be traced over 20 years and today we should be reaping the benefit of the conclusion of intense negotiations and compromises, not only here in Parliament, but also in the Council and amongst the social partners.
The Common position offers the most appropriate means of ensuring that we can achieve the objective of guaranteeing that employees have real access to information and consultation, and also offers them an opportunity to have an input into the continuing operation of the enterprise.
Unfortunately, the amendments proposed by the rapporteur and approved by the Committee of Employment and Social Affairs goes totally against the spirit of co-operation achieved up to now.
In particular, the issue of sanctions to be imposed at an EU level flies totally in the face of subsidiarity and competences of national governments.
All that has been gained is that this issue ends up in conciliation and brings us no nearer to achieving the real goal of securing information and consultation for the employees of the European Union over the running of their companies.
.
Generally, I welcome the outcome of this vote, although I wish more Members had been willing to support the amendments dealing with sanctions against companies that fail to implement the directive's requirements.
However, there is no doubt that the measures agreed by Parliament will make an important difference for many workers throughout the EU.
Hopefully, thanks to the tighter definitions of the information required and the proposal for a delay for full consultation in the light of proposed large-scale redundancies and other potentially harmful changes, we shall avoid the situation where we see workers appealing to this Parliament to protect their rights and interests.
I also welcome Parliament's insistence on the rapid implementation of this directive for all Member States, whatever the current state of employee representation.
I trust that Council will now follow Parliament's lead.
.
I wholeheartedly support this report by Mrs Jensen.
The call to increase the EU's fund for job creation comes at a time when the EU is attempting to coordinate its employment strategies by the so-called open method of coordination.
This fund could do much to bolster these efforts and consolidate the work under way since the Lisbon dot.com Summit.
Moreover, the report also recognises the valid and worthwhile role that local and regional authorities can play in the process of job creation.
It is only when we work with such authorities, who have vital in-depth knowledge of regional employment needs and peculiarities at their disposal, that we shall be able to reap the potential benefits outlined in this report.
Report Thorning-Schmidt (A5-0320/2001):
Mr President, the pensioners who sent me, Mr Carlo Fatuzzo, here include a large number of people who have become ill as a consequence of exposure to mechanical vibrations throughout their working lives.
I therefore voted for Mrs Thorning-Schmidt' s report, although I know she would prefer me not to speak any more in this Chamber and has tabled an anti-Fatuzzo amendment which, I am glad to say, was rejected by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
I therefore call for working hours to be limited in places where there are vibrations which are unavoidable because of the nature of the activity to be performed but which are more frequent than the maximum permitted limits.
According to Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, 24% of workers in Europe are exposed to mechanical vibrations.
These are mainly those working in the mining, building, manufacturing, forestry and transport industries.
Hand-arm vibrations cause serious and virtually systematic problems, such as the 'white finger' phenomenon in woodcutters and forestry workers; carpal tunnel syndrome, poor circulation and loss of feeling.
Whole body vibrations cause lumbar pain, slipped discs, as well as premature degeneration of the spinal column.
However, despite the fact that these problems are known to be harmful to workers' health, it has taken almost ten years for a European directive to be drafted!
The reason why this has taken so long is because the management in these sectors and equipment manufacturers are taking a stand, and they do not want restrictive standards, which would mean the equipment used would have to be replaced immediately in the light of technological developments.
Furthermore, businesses do not always use approved equipment. And where they do, they do not necessarily inspect it on a regular basis, so the vibrations increase.
Above all, however, the conditions under which people are obliged to work are considerably aggravating factors.
The equipment concerned is often used by workers who are paid for their output, in terrible conditions of intensive work.
We must oblige businesses to pay for regular breaks throughout the day.
It is scandalous that workers continue to risk their health in order to earn a living.
Report Korhola (A5-0321/2001):
When the environment is respected as it is in Mrs Korhola' s directive, Mr President, we are all extremely happy.
Indeed, I have just returned from a visit of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to Slovakia, where we saw the progress made by this country in environmental matters, and I have to say that we were all happy campers, Mr President.
Just think, one evening, as I was about to get into the lift to go to the second floor, I saw Mr Bushill-Matthews and the usually impassive Mr Blokland rush into the lift, both extremely happy too, shouting in unison: 'Mr Fatuzzo, we cannot leave you alone with Mrs Malliori' , who, as we all know, is extremely attractive like all Greek women.
Even Mr De Roo, who places great store by silence, heard these utterances!
'Public participation' in 'plans relating to the environment' is something we are obviously in favour of.
However, this report is another of those indecisive documents, where the proclaimed good intentions do not hide the ineffective measures proposed.
If we consider current events in France alone, the Mont Blanc tunnel has been reopened despite the views of the people living nearby; the protests of those living in the Rhône valley against the noise pollution caused by lorries using the motorway, or even against the route of the TGV railway line, have been disregarded, we can see how little importance the authorities attach to public opinion when it is voiced.
Apart from that, what control can the public now have over preventing a disaster, such as that of the sinking of the Erika, from polluting hundreds of kilometres of coastline?
What control can the public even have over preventing a disaster, which, unfortunately, is not only ecological, such as that of the explosion at the AZF factory, from happening again?
In reality, since the public does not have the right and the means to control the activity of businesses such as TotalFinaElf, nor does it have the possibility of banning any economic policy that is detrimental to society and to its own workers, 'public participation' comes across as a hollow expression.
We abstained from the vote.
Although this proposal for a directive makes some welcome amendments to certain aspects of Community legislation, it represents a reductive and inadequate view of the implementation of the Aarhus Convention, which has already been ratified by all of the European Union' s Member States.
Nevertheless, its contribution to the implementation of the Aarhus Convention in the Member States is very small, as is the implementation of the Convention in procedures and decisions at Community level.
The proposals contained in the Korhola report do, by and large, improve the document, although they do not sufficiently resolve all the shortcomings of the proposal for a Directive, which is why we have also voted in favour of other proposals that extend the report' s proposal, thereby helping to ensure that an opportunity is not wasted in the complex process of implementing the Aarhus Convention.
What has also become clear during this debate is that the importance of this Convention' s content and its ratification by all the Member States justify an extension of the debate, a broader and more inclusive discussion and a more appropriate and committed response from the Commission, and not the minimalist vision contained in the proposal it has submitted to the European Parliament.
.
This proposal intends to ensure that opportunities are given for public participation at an early and decisive stage of environmental decision making.
This includes public participation and the drawing up of certain plans and programmes, greater participation in the procedure concerning the implementation of environmental impact assessment statements as well as in the putting in place of integrated pollution prevention and control measures.
Annex 1 of the Directive lists the instruments in relation to which the public for the first time are be given the opportunity to participate in the drawing up of plans and programmes.
Such provisions are to be inserted in the directives on waste, the protection of waters against nitrate pollution as well as being included in the hazardous waste, copper packaging, air quality and landfill of waste directives.
The main thrust of this directive is to ensure that information must be made available to the public within a reasonable timeframe. The public must be given the opportunity to express comments and opinions before decisions are made.
It is important that the citizens of Europe are involved in decisions that are taken at a European Union level.
The European Union and national governments support the principle of subsidiarity which guarantees that decision-making incorporates a local input at every opportunity.
We are also all aware of the environmental proofing of EU regulations and directives which is now constantly taking place.
I support progress.
I support economic development. We must ensure that there is a balance between the protection of our environment and economic progress at all times.
This directive which is before us is a balanced piece of legislation which I am sure will be supported by all Members of the House.
.
I welcome this initiative and was very happy to support many of the amendments and the report itself in the final vote.
I deeply regret Parliament's unwillingness to really open up access to such decisions to the widest possible number of people.
The willingness of the largest groups to maintain the restrictions to the 'concerned public' , which will be defined by the Member States, is a surefire way to continue to leave certain people deeply dissatisfied and feeling sidelined.
At least we managed to support the rapporteur's proposals to have some definition as to what the 'concerned public' might be.
We have also managed to argue that the relevant authorities should make some response to show that the concerns of the concerned have been heard.
However, a frequent complaint is that objections were raised but nothing happened.
Parliament has given itself little room to manoeuvre in future negotiations with Council, so I hope we shall at least maintain the limited progress made today.
.
I wholeheartedly support this report by Mrs Korhola.
In an era where many citizens, from all sections of society, feel disenfranchised and marginalised, the call for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment is certainly needed.
This proposal, the first of its kind, could see everyday citizens involved in and having say about issues ranging from air quality to the protection of water.
The report makes concrete and practical recommendations as to how public participation in this domain can be realised; for example, information must be made available within a reasonable time-frame.
In addition, citizens would be entitled to submit their comments either orally or in writing.
The report addresses many of the tricky issues that have faced decision-makers since the demonstrations at Seattle, Stockholm and Genoa: it could lead to greater transparency and accountability since citizens could act as both a check on decision-makers' complete autonomy and they could be more informed of the decisions which are being taken in their name.
Effective public participation in the drawing-up of plans and programmes for the environment is of the greatest importance and, therefore, all means of disseminating information to the public are essential, particularly the Internet.
There are other areas directly linked to the environment, in which the public must also participate, such as the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and the common agricultural policy.
The Commission must, therefore, review its decision to consider general policy options to be non-binding and ensure that its proposals meet the requirements laid down in the Aarhus Convention on effective public participation.
It has become necessary to broaden the definition of 'public' as much as possible.
Inequality in access to adequate means of assessment for small and local voluntary groups compared with the resources of large corporations or public authorities is an important issue and must be taken into consideration.
Report von Boetticher (A5-0339/2001):
Mr President, while I was in the aeroplane on the way to Slovakia, I closed my eyes for a second, as frequently happens, resulting in interesting dreams which I have related in many explanations of vote. This time, I saw my daughter, Cristina - who, as we all know, has been striving to finish her degree in law for six years - graduating at last.
She had specialised in Community law and received a prize of EUR 1 000 for developing Community law, which is also what the von Boetticher report seeks to do.
I therefore voted for the report.
But Mr President, which was the dream: the fact that my daughter Cristina had graduated in law or the fact that we had, at last, succeeded in establishing the European lawyer, with a EUR 2 000 prize, which is what should happen in Europe?
The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of this report because we agree that the EU should develop cooperation in the area of civil law for the benefit of EU citizens.
We are nonetheless alert to the fact that the regulation does not apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark' s position with respect to the Treaty on European Union.
Report von Boetticher (A5-0333/2001):
Mr President, I voted for the second von Boetticher report.
How could I have voted against a report whose objective is to make it possible to move within the European Union more quickly and rapidly, providing for effective identity checks on the undesirables in our Union?
We'd also made cricket the only sport in India, which is a pity, but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big, which is a bit of a tragedy of our times.
Now, this last minute before I go -- there's a couple of side effects of all this.
For a long time, India was this country of poverty, dust, beggars, snake charmers, filth, Delhi belly -- people heard Delhi belly stories before they came.
And, all of a sudden, India was this land of opportunity.
Cricketers all over the world said, "You know, we love India. We love to play in India."
And that felt good, you know?
We said, "The dollar's quite powerful actually."
Can you imagine, you've got the dollar on view and there's no Delhi belly in there anymore.
There's no filth, there's no beggars, all the snake charmers have vanished, everybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules.
Right so, finally, an English game that India usurped a little bit, but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world.
If you want to take the game around the world, it's got to be the shortest form of the game.
You can't take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end, or you can't take it all over the world.
So that's what T20 is doing.
Hopefully, it'll make everyone richer, hopefully it'll make the game bigger and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

We all make decisions every day; we want to know what the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic.
And surely, if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times, that would be a tremendous gift.
It turns out that, in fact, the world was given this gift in 1738 by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli.
And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is, and I also want to explain to you why it is that it hasn't made a damn bit of difference.
Now, this is Bernoulli's gift. This is a direct quote.
And if it looks like Greek to you, it's because, well, it's Greek.
But the simple English translation -- much less precise, but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say -- was this: The expected value of any of our actions -- that is, the goodness that we can count on getting -- is the product of two simple things: the odds that this action will allow us to gain something, and the value of that gain to us.
In a sense, what Bernoulli was saying is, if we can estimate and multiply these two things, we will always know precisely how we should behave.
Now, this simple equation, even for those of you who don't like equations, is something that you're quite used to.
Here's an example: if I were to tell you, let's play a little coin toss game, and I'm going to flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars, but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me, most of you would say, sure, I'll take that bet. Because you know that the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars, that multiplies to five, and that's more than I'm charging you to play. So, the answer is, yes.
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet.
Now, the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses, but in fact, it's not very simple in everyday life.
People are horrible at estimating both of these things, and that's what I want to talk to you about today.
There are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do, and those are errors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed, and errors in estimating the value of their own success.
Now, let me talk about the first one first.
Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy: there are six sides to a die, two sides to a coin, 52 cards in a deck.
You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads.
But as it turns out, this is not a very easy idea to apply in everyday life. That's why Americans spend more -- I should say, lose more -- gambling than on all other forms of entertainment combined.
The reason is, this isn't how people do odds.
The way people figure odds requires that we first talk a bit about pigs.
Now, the question I'm going to put to you is whether you think there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed in any particular day in Oxford.
And of course, you all know that the answer is dogs.
And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you've seen dogs and pigs on leashes.
It was very easy to remember seeing dogs, not so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind, then dogs on leashes are more probable.
That's not a bad rule of thumb, except when it is.
So, for example, here's a word puzzle.
Are there more four-letter English words with R in the third place or R in the first place?
Well, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan, and it's awfully easy to say to yourself, Ring, Rang, Rung, and very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly.
But in fact, there are many more words in the English language with R in the third than the first place.
The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind isn't because they're improbable, unlikely or infrequent.
It's because the mind recalls words by their first letter.
You kind of shout out the sound, S -- and the word comes.
It's like the dictionary; it's hard to look things up by the third letter.
So, this is an example of how this idea that the quickness with which things come to mind can give you a sense of their probability -- how this idea could lead you astray. It's not just puzzles, though.
For example, when Americans are asked to estimate the odds that they will die in a variety of interesting ways -- these are estimates of number of deaths per year per 200 million U.S. citizens.
And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked to guess how many people die from tornado, fireworks, asthma, drowning, etc.
Compare these to the actual numbers.
Now, you see a very interesting pattern here, which is first of all, two things are vastly over-estimated, namely tornadoes and fireworks.
Two things are vastly underestimated: dying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why?
When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper and the headline was, "Boy dies of Asthma?"
It's not interesting because it's so common.
It's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances of news stories or newsreels where we've seen tornadoes devastating cities, or some poor schmuck who's blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July.
Drownings and asthma deaths don't get much coverage.
They don't come quickly to mind, and as a result, we vastly underestimate them.
Indeed, this is kind of like the Sesame Street game of "Which thing doesn't belong?" And you're right to say it's the swimming pool that doesn't belong, because the swimming pool is the only thing on this slide that's actually very dangerous.
The way that more of you are likely to die than the combination of all three of the others that you see on the slide.
The lottery is an excellent example, of course -- an excellent test-case of people's ability to compute probabilities.
And economists -- forgive me, for those of you who play the lottery -- but economists, at least among themselves, refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax, because the odds of getting any payoff by investing your money in a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushing the money directly down the toilet -- which, by the way, doesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything.
Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery?
Well, there are many answers, but one answer surely is, we see a lot of winners. Right? When this couple wins the lottery, or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check -- how the hell do you cash things that size, I don't know.
We see this on TV; we read about it in the paper.
When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost?
Indeed, if we required that television stations run a 30-second interview with each loser every time they interview a winner, the 100 million losers in the last lottery would require nine-and-a-half years of your undivided attention just to watch them say, "Me? I lost." "Me? I lost."
Now, if you watch nine-and-a-half years of television -- no sleep, no potty breaks -- and you saw loss after loss after loss, and then at the end there's 30 seconds of, "and I won," the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small.
Look, I can prove this to you: here's a little lottery.
There's 10 tickets in this lottery.
Nine of them have been sold to these individuals.
It costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and, if you win, you get 20 bucks. Is this a good bet?
Well, Bernoulli tells us it is.
The expected value of this lottery is two dollars; this is a lottery in which you should invest your money.
And most people say, "OK, I'll play."
Now, a slightly different version of this lottery: imagine that the nine tickets are all owned by one fat guy named Leroy.
Leroy has nine tickets; there's one left.
Do you want it? Most people won't play this lottery.
Now, you can see the odds of winning haven't changed, but it's now fantastically easy to imagine who's going to win.
It's easy to see Leroy getting the check, right?
You can't say to yourself, "I'm as likely to win as anybody," because you're not as likely to win as Leroy.
The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy changes your decision to play, even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds.
Now, estimating odds, as difficult as it may seem, is a piece of cake compared to trying to estimate value: trying to say what something is worth, how much we'll enjoy it, how much pleasure it will give us.
I want to talk now about errors in value.
How much is this Big Mac worth? Is it worth 25 dollars?
Most of you have the intuition that it's not -- you wouldn't pay that for it.
But in fact, to decide whether a Big Mac is worth 25 dollars requires that you ask one, and only one question, which is: What else can I do with 25 dollars?
If you've ever gotten on one of those long-haul flights to Australia and realized that they're not going to serve you any food, but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened the McDonald's bag, and the smell of golden arches is wafting over the seat, you think, I can't do anything else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours.
I can't even set it on fire -- they took my cigarette lighter!
Suddenly, 25 dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal.
On the other hand, if you're visiting an underdeveloped country, and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal, it's exorbitant for a Big Mac.
Why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no, before I'd even told you anything about the context?
Because most of you compared the price of this Big Mac to the price you're used to paying. Rather than asking, "What else can I do with my money," comparing this investment to other possible investments, you compared to the past.
And this is a systematic error people make.
What you knew is, you paid three dollars in the past; 25 is outrageous.
This is an error, and I can prove it to you by showing the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads.
For example, this is, of course, one of the most delicious tricks in marketing, is to say something used to be higher, and suddenly it seems like a very good deal.
When people are asked about these two different jobs: a job where you make 60K, then 50K, then 40K, a job where you're getting a salary cut each year, and one in which you're getting a salary increase, people like the second job better than the first, despite the fact they're all told they make much less money. Why?
Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages, even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period. Here's another nice example.
Here's a $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package; it's now on sale for 1,600.
Assuming you wanted to go to Hawaii, would you buy this package?
Most people say they would. Here's a slightly different story: $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars, so you decide to mull it over for a week.
By the time you get to the ticket agency, the best fares are gone -- the package now costs 1,500. Would you buy it? Most people say, no.
Why? Because it used to cost 700, and there's no way I'm paying 1,500 for something that was 700 last week.
This tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words, a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal.
Here's another example of how comparing to the past can befuddle our decisions.
Imagine that you're going to the theater.
You're on your way to the theater.
In your wallet you have a ticket, for which you paid 20 dollars.
You also have a 20-dollar bill.
When you arrive at the theater, you discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket.
Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it?
Most people answer, no.
Now, let's just change one thing in this scenario.
You're on your way to the theater, and in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills.
When you arrive you discover you've lost one of them.
Would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket?
Well, of course, I went to the theater to see the play.
What does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do?
Now, just in case you're not getting it, here's a schematic of what happened, OK?
Along the way, you lost something.
In both cases, it was a piece of paper.
In one case, it had a U.S. president on it; in the other case it didn't.
What the hell difference should it make?
The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself, I'm not paying twice for the same thing.
You compare the cost of the play now -- 40 dollars -- to the cost that it used to have -- 20 dollars -- and you say it's a bad deal.
Comparing with the past causes many of the problems that behavioral economists and psychologists identify in people's attempts to assign value.
But even when we compare with the possible, instead of the past, we still make certain kinds of mistakes.
And I'm going to show you one or two of them.
One of the things we know about comparison: that when we compare one thing to the other, it changes its value.
So in 1992, this fellow, George Bush, for those of us who were kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum, didn't seem like such a great guy.
Suddenly, we're almost longing for him to return.
The comparison changes how we evaluate him.
Now, retailers knew this long before anybody else did, of course, and they use this wisdom to help you -- spare you the undue burden of money.
And so a retailer, if you were to go into a wine shop and you had to buy a bottle of wine, and you see them here for eight, 27 and 33 dollars, what would you do?
Most people don't want the most expensive, they don't want the least expensive.
So, they will opt for the item in the middle.
If you're a smart retailer, then, you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf, because suddenly the $33 wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison.
So I'm telling you something you already knew: namely, that comparison changes the value of things.
Here's why that's a problem: the problem is that when you get that $33 bottle of wine home, it won't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to.
The comparisons we make when we are appraising value, where we're trying to estimate how much we'll like things, are not the same comparisons we'll be making when we consume them.
This problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil our attempts to make rational decisions.
Let me just give you an example.
I have to show you something from my own lab, so let me sneak this in.
These are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions: How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now?
They're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them.
For some of the subjects, sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of Godiva chocolates, and for others is a can of Spam.
In fact, these items that are sitting in the room change how much the subjects think they're going to enjoy the potato chips.
Namely, those who are looking at Spam think potato chips are going to be quite tasty; those who are looking at Godiva chocolate think they won't be nearly so tasty.
Of course, what happens when they eat the potato chips?
Well, look, you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful of greasy, salty, crispy, delicious snacks, what's sitting in the corner of the room makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience.
Nonetheless, their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience.
You've all experienced this yourself, even if you've never come into our lab to eat potato chips. So here's a question: You want to buy a car stereo.
The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars, but if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks.
So would you drive to get 50 percent off, saving 100 dollars?
Most people say they would.
They can't imagine buying it for twice the price when, with one trip across town, they can get it for half off.
Now, let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo, and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000.
But if you drove across town, you could get it for 30,900.
Would you drive to get it? At this point, 0.003 savings -- the 100 dollars.
Most people say, no, I'm going to schlep across town to save 100 bucks on the purchase of a car?
This kind of thinking drives economists crazy, and it should.
Because this 100 dollars that you save -- hello! -- doesn't know where it came from.
It doesn't know what you saved it on.
When you go to buy groceries with it, it doesn't go, I'm the money saved on the car stereo, or, I'm the dumb money saved on the car. It's money.
And if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks, it's worth 100 bucks no matter what you're saving it on. People don't think that way.
That's why they don't know whether their mutual fund manager is taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment, but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste.
Now, you can see, this is the problem of shifting comparisons, because what you're doing is, you're comparing the 100 bucks to the purchase that you're making, but when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison.
You've all had this experience.
If you're an American, for example, you've probably traveled in France.
And at some point you may have met a couple from your own hometown, and you thought, "Oh, my God, these people are so warm. They're so nice to me.
I mean, compared to all these people who hate me when I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don't, these people are just wonderful." And so you tour France with them, and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner, and what do you find?
Compared to your regular friends, they are boring and dull, right? Because in this new context, the comparison is very, very different. In fact, you find yourself disliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship.
Now, you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo.
You go to the stereo store, you see two sets of speakers -- these big, boxy, monoliths, and these little, sleek speakers, and you play them, and you go, you know, I do hear a difference: the big ones sound a little better.
And so you buy them, and you bring them home, and you entirely violate the décor of your house.
And the problem, of course, is that this comparison you made in the store is a comparison you'll never make again.
What are the odds that years later you'll turn on the stereo and go, "Sounds so much better than those little ones," which you can't even remember hearing.
The problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult when these choices are arrayed over time.
People have a lot of trouble making decisions about things that will happen at different points in time.
And what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered is that by and large people use two simple rules.
So let me give you one very easy problem, a second very easy problem and then a third, hard, problem.
Here's the first easy problem: You can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now. Which would you prefer?
This is what we call a one-item IQ test, OK?
All of us, I hope, prefer more money, and the reason is, we believe more is better than less.
Here's the second problem: You can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month. Which would you prefer?
Again, an easy decision, because we all know that now is better than later.
What's hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict.
For example, when you're offered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars in a month.
This typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain by waiting, but you have to be patient.
What do we know? What do people do in these kinds of situations?
Well, by and large people are enormously impatient.
That is, they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars.
Maybe that isn't so remarkable, but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing Imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that's 12 months -- or 60 dollars in 13 months.
What do we find now?
People are gladly willing to wait: as long as they're waiting 12, they might as well wait 13.
What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen?
Comparison. Troubling comparison. Let me show you.
This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested you would show if I gave you time to respond, which is, people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher than the subjective value of 60 when they'll be delivered in now or one month, respectively -- a 30-day delay -- but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision off into the future a year.
Now, why in the world do you get this pattern of results?
These guys can tell us.
What you see here are two lads, one of them larger than the other: the fireman and the fiddler.
They are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon, and I want you to notice two things.
At no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No point.
However, the difference between them seems to be getting smaller.
First it's an inch in your view, then it's a quarter-inch, then a half-inch, and then finally they go off the edge of the earth.
Here are the results of what I just showed you.
This is the subjective height -- the height you saw of these guys at various points.
And I want you to see that two things are true.
One, the farther away they are, the smaller they look; and two, the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler.
But watch what happens when we make some of them disappear. Right.
At a very close distance, the fiddler looks taller than the fireman, but at a far distance their normal, their true, relations are preserved.
As Plato said, what space is to size, time is to value.
These are the results of the hard problem I gave you: 60 now or 50 in a month?
And these are subjective values, and what you can see is, our two rules are preserved.
People always think more is better than less: 60 is always better than 50, and they always think now is better than later: the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side.
Watch what happens when we drop some out.
Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us.
We have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now over waiting a month, but not if that decision is far in the future.
Notice something interesting that this implies -- namely, that when people get to the future, they will change their minds.
That is, as that month 12 approaches, you will say, what was I thinking, waiting an extra month for 60 dollars?
I'll take the 50 dollars now.
Well, the question with which I'd like to end is this: If we're so damn stupid, how did we get to the moon?
Because I could go on for about two hours with evidence of people's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value.
The answer to this question, I think, is an answer you've already heard in some of the talks, and I dare say you will hear again: namely, that our brains were evolved for a very different world than the one in which we are living.
They were evolved for a world in which people lived in very small groups, rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves, had rather short lives in which there were few choices and the highest priority was to eat and mate today.
Bernoulli's gift, Bernoulli's little formula, allows us, it tells us how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us.
That explains why we are so bad at using it, but it also explains why it is so terribly important that we become good, fast.
We are the only species on this planet that has ever held its own fate in its hands.
We have no significant predators, we're the masters of our physical environment; the things that normally cause species to become extinct are no longer any threat to us.
The only thing -- the only thing -- that can destroy us and doom us are our own decisions.
If we're not here in 10,000 years, it's going to be because we could not take advantage of the gift given to us by a young Dutch fellow in 1738, because we underestimated the odds of our future pains and overestimated the value of our present pleasures.
Thank you.
That was remarkable.
We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert. One and two.
Bill Lyell: Would you say that this mechanism is in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us, and is there some way that we could counteract that?
Dan Gilbert: I actually was consulting recently with the Department of Homeland Security, which generally believes that American security dollars should go to making borders safer.
I tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name based on people's psychological reaction to a set of events, and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified, rather than -- not rather than, but in addition to stopping the atrocities that we're all concerned about.
Surely the kinds of play that at least American media give to -- and forgive me, but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents.
We already know, for example, in the United States, more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes -- because they were scared -- and driving on highways, than were killed in 9/11. OK?
If I told you that there was a plague that was going to kill 15,000 Americans next year, you might be alarmed if you didn't find out it was the flu.
These are small-scale accidents, and we should be wondering whether they should get the kind of play, the kind of coverage, that they do.
Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they'll be hurt in these various ways, and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us.
Dan, I'd like to hear more on this. So, you're saying that our response to terror is, I mean, it's a form of mental bug?
Talk more about it.
DG: It's out-sized. I mean, look.
If Australia disappears tomorrow, terror is probably the right response.
That's an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand, when a bus blows up and 30 people are killed, more people than that were killed by not using their seatbelts in the same country.
Is terror the right response?
What causes the bug? Is it the drama of the event -- that it's so spectacular?
Is it the fact that it's an intentional attack by, quote, outsiders?
What is it?
DG: Yes. It's a number of things, and you hit on several of them.
First, it's a human agent trying to kill us -- it's not a tree falling on us by accident.
Second, these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again.
People are being killed for no reason instead of good reason -- as if there's good reason, but sometimes people think there are.
So there are a number of things that together make this seem like a fantastic event, but let's not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media, who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can.
I mean, what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it?
DG: Well, go to Israel. You know, go to Israel. And a mall blows up, and then everybody's unhappy about it, and an hour-and-a-half later -- at least when I was there, and I was 150 feet from the mall when it blew up -- I went back to my hotel and the wedding that was planned was still going on.
And as the Israeli mother said, she said, "We never let them win by stopping weddings."
I mean, this is a society that has learned -- and there are others too -- that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it, shall I say, as those of us who have not had many terror attacks.
But is there a rational fear that actually, the reason we're frightened about this is because we think that the Big One is to come?
DG: Yes, of course. So, if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be, there might be more and more buses of 30 people -- we would probably not be nearly so frightened.
I don't want to say -- please, I'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying, "Terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed."
That's not my point at all.
What I'm saying is that, surely, rationally, our distress about things that happen, about threats, should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come.
I think in the case of terrorism, it isn't.
And many of the things we've heard about from our speakers today -- how many people do you know got up and said, Poverty! I can't believe what poverty is doing to us.
People get up in the morning; they don't care about poverty.
It's not making headlines, it's not making news, it's not flashy.
There are no guns going off.
I mean, if you had to solve one of these problems, Chris, which would you solve? Terrorism or poverty?
That's a tough one.
There's no question.
Poverty, by an order of magnitude, a huge order of magnitude, unless someone can show that there's, you know, terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come.
The latest I've read, seen, thought is that it's incredibly hard for them to do that.
If that turns out to be wrong, we all look silly, but with poverty it's a bit -- DG: Even if that were true, still more people die from poverty.
We've evolved to get all excited about these dramatic attacks. Is that because in the past, in the ancient past, we just didn't understand things like disease and systems that cause poverty and so forth, and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy into worrying about those things?
People died; so be it.
But if you got attacked, that was something you could do something about.
And so we evolved these responses.
Is that what happened?
DG: Well, you know, the people who are most skeptical about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything are the evolutionary psychologists themselves.
My guess is that there's nothing quite that specific in our evolutionary past. But rather, if you're looking for an evolutionary explanation, you might say that most organisms are neo-phobic -- that is, they're a little scared of stuff that's new and different.
And there's a good reason to be, because old stuff didn't eat you. Right?
Any animal you see that you've seen before is less likely to be a predator than one that you've never seen before.
So, you know, when a school bus is blown up and we've never seen this before, our general tendency is to orient towards that which is new and novel is activated.
I don't think it's quite as specific a mechanism as the one you alluded to, but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it.
Jay Walker: You know, economists love to talk about the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect you're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of, which is the error of value.
I know, because I've interviewed about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years.
It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning.
That's what you think it is. All right?
The average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year, so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose, and yet she buys 150 tickets a year. Why is that?
It's not because she is stupid or he is stupid.
It's because the anticipation of possibly winning releases serotonin in the brain, and actually provides a good feeling until the drawing indicates you've lost.
Or, to put it another way, for the dollar investment, you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money down the toilet, which you cannot have a good feeling from.
Now, economists tend to -- -- economists tend to view the world through their own lenses, which is: this is just a bunch of stupid people.
And as a result, many people look at economists as stupid people.
And so fundamentally, the reason we got to the moon is, we didn't listen to the economists. Thank you very much.
DG: Well, no, it's a great point. It remains to be seen whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled by the amount of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember, people who didn't buy tickets don't feel awful the next day either, even though they don't feel great during the drawing.
I would disagree that people know they're not going to win.
I think they think it's unlikely, but it could happen, which is why they prefer that to the flushing.
But certainly I see your point: that there can be some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning.
Now, I think there's many good reasons not to listen to economists.
That isn't one of them, for me, but there's many others.
Last question.
Aubrey de Grey: My name's Aubrey de Grey, from Cambridge.
I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills -- I work on aging -- and I'm interested in doing something about it, as we'll all hear tomorrow.
I very much resonate with what you're saying, because it seems to me that the problem with getting people interested in doing anything about aging is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer or heart disease or whatever. Do you have any advice?
DG: For you or for them?
AdG: In persuading them.
DG: Ah, for you in persuading them.
Well, it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted.
But one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work is to get people to imagine the future more vividly.
One of the problems with making decisions about the far future and the near future is that we imagine the near future much more vividly than the far future.
To the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail that people put into the mental representations of near and far future, people begin to make decisions about the two in the same way.
So, would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you're 65 is a question that's very different than, imagine who you'll be when you're 65: will you be living, what will you look like, how much hair will you have, who will you be living with.
Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario, suddenly we feel like it might be important to save so that that guy has a little retirement money.
But these are tricks around the margins.
I think in general you're battling a very fundamental human tendency, which is to say, "I'm here today, and so now is more important than later."
Dan, thank you. Members of the audience, that was a fantastic session. Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/milton_glaser_on_using_design_to_make_ideas_new.html</url>
'Theme and variations' is one of those forms that require a certain kind of intellectual activity, because you are always comparing the variation with the theme that you hold in your mind.
You might say that the theme is nature and everything that follows is a variation on the subject.
I was asked, I guess about six years ago, to do a series of paintings that in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca.
And it was very difficult for me to imagine how to paint pictures that were based on Piero until I realized that I could look at Piero as nature -- that I would have the same attitude towards looking at Piero della Francesca as I would if I were looking out a window at a tree.
And that was enormously liberating to me.
Perhaps it's not a very insightful observation, but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations based on a work by Piero, in this case that remarkable painting that's in the Uffizi, "The Duke of Montefeltro," who faces his consort, Battista.
Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject, I did the following series of drawings.
That's the real Piero della Francesca -- one of the greatest portraits in human history.
And these, I'll just show these without comment.
It's just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro, who's a great, great figure in the Renaissance, and probably the basis for Machiavelli's "The Prince."
He apparently lost an eye in battle, which is why he is always shown in profile.
And this is Battista.
And then I decided I could move them around a little bit -- so that for the first time in history, they're facing the same direction.
Whoops! Passed each other.
And then a visitor from another painting by Piero, this is from "The Resurrection of Christ" -- as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat.
And now, four large panels: this is upper left; upper right; lower left; lower right.
Incidentally, I've never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism.
Since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with there doesn't seem to be an argument there.
On another subject -- -- I was driving in the country one day with my wife, and I saw this sign, and I said, "That is a fabulous piece of design."
And she said, "What are you talking about?"
I said, "Well, it's so persuasive, because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage, and since most people are so suspicious of garages, and know that they're going to be ripped off, they use the word 'reliable.' But everybody says they're reliable.
But, reliable Dutchman" -- -- "Fantastic!"
Because as soon as you hear the word Dutchman -- which is an archaic word, nobody calls Dutch people "Dutchmen" anymore -- but as soon as you hear Dutchman, you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike, preventing the thing from falling and flooding Holland, and so on.
And so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of "Dutchman."
Now, if you think I'm exaggerating at all in this, all you have to do is substitute something else, like "Indonesian."
Or even "French."
Now, "Swiss" works, but you know it's going to cost a lot of money.
I'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster.
I do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts, where I teach, and the director of this school -- a remarkable man named Silas Rhodes -- often gives you a piece of text and he says, "Do something with this."
And so he did.
And this was the text -- "In words as fashion the same rule will hold/ Alike fantastic if too new or old/ Be not the first by whom the new are tried/ Nor yet the last to lay the old aside."
I could make nothing of that.
And I really struggled with this one.
And the first thing I did, which was sort of in the absence of another idea, was say I'll sort of write it out and make some words big, and I'll have some kind of design on the back somehow, and I was hoping -- as one often does -- to stumble into something.
So I took another crack at it -- you've got to keep it moving -- and I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and I pasted them down on an ugly board.
I thought that something would come out of it, like "Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope" because it's by Alexander Pope, but I sort of made a mess out of it, and then I thought I'd repeat it in some way so it was legible.
So, it was going nowhere.
Sometimes, in the middle of a resistant problem, I write down things that I know about it.
But you can see the beginning of an idea there, because you can see the word "new" emerging from the "old."
That's what happens.
There's a relationship between the old and the new; the new emerges from the context of the old.
And then I did some variations of it, but it still wasn't coalescing graphically at all.
I had this other version which had something interesting about it in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues.
The W was clearly a W, the N was clearly an N, even though they were very fragmentary and there wasn't a lot of information in it.
Then I got the words "new" and "old" and now I had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return.
I was really desperate at this point.
And so, I do something I'm truthfully ashamed of, which is that I took two drawings I had made for another purpose and I put them together.
It says "dreams" at the top.
And I was going to do a thing, I say, "Well, change the copy.
Let it say something about dreams, and come to SVA and you'll sort of fulfill your dreams."
But, to my credit, I was so embarrassed about doing that that I never submitted this sketch.
And, finally, I arrived at the following solution.
Now, it doesn't look terribly interesting, but it does have something that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters.
For one thing, it transgresses the idea of what a poster's supposed to be, which is to be understood and seen immediately, and not explained.
I remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts -- "If you have to explain it, it ain't working."
And one day I woke up and I said, "Well, suppose that's not true?"
So here's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left.
It says, "Thoughts: This poem is impossible.
Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations.
This one generates no imagery at all."
I am now exposing myself to my audience, right?
Which is something you never want to do professionally.
"Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening.
What's the heart of this poem?
Don't be trendy if you want to be serious.
Is doing the poster this way trendy in itself?
I guess one could reduce the idea further by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old, like this."
And then I show you a little drawing -- you see, you remember that old thing I discarded?
Well, I found a way to use it.
So, there's that little alternative over there, and I say, "Not bad," -- criticizing myself -- "but more didactic than visual.
Maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace, a kind of dance where each defines the other."
And then more self-questioning -- "Am I being simple-minded?
Is this the kind of simple that looks obvious, or the kind that looks profound?
There's a significant difference.
This could be embarrassing.
Actually, I realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition.
Do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school?"
Well, I think there are two fresh things here -- two fresh things.
One is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience, and not to suggest that I am confident about what I'm doing.
And as you know, you have to have a front.
I mean -- you've got to be confident; if you don't believe in your work, who else is going to believe in it?
So that's one thing, to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics.
That can be a big contribution.
The other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one; you get the big one and if you don't like that, how about the little one?
And that too is a relatively new idea.
And here's just a series of experiments where I ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square?
Now, this is a little illusion.
That poster is not folded.
It's not folded, that's a photograph Same cheap trick in the upper left-hand corner.
And here, a very peculiar poster because, simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer, it won't sit still in the space.
At times, it seems to be wider at the back than the front, and then it shifts.
And if you sit here long enough, it'll float off the page into the audience.
But, we don't have time.
And then an experiment -- a little bit about the nature of perspective, where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective, but the shape of the bottle -- which is identical to the outside shape -- is seen frontally.
And another piece for the art directors' club is "Anna Rees" casting long shadows.
This is another poster from the School of Visual Arts.
There were 10 artists invited to participate in it, and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and I didn't want to be embarrassed, so I worked very hard on this.
The idea was -- and it was a brilliant idea -- was to have 10 posters distributed throughout the city's subway system so every time you got on the subway you'd be passing a different poster, all of which had a different idea of what art is.
But I was absolutely stuck on the idea of "art is" and trying to determine what art was.
But then I gave up and I said, "Well, art is whatever."
And as soon as I said that, I discovered that the word "hat" was hidden in the word "whatever," and that led me to the inevitable conclusion.
But then again, it's on my list of didactic posters.
My intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster, in case you don't get it.
Now this says, "Note to the viewer: I thought I might use a visual cliche of our time -- Magritte's everyman -- to express the idea that art is mystery, continuity and history.
I'm also convinced that, in an age of computer manipulation, surrealism has become banal, a shadow of its former self.
The phrase 'Art is whatever' expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art-making -- a sort of 'it ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it' notion.
The shadow of Magritte falls across the central part of the poster a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word 'hat,' hidden in the word 'whatever.' The four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined: as a thing itself, the worth of the thing, the shadow of the thing, and the shape of the thing.
Whatever."
OK.
And the one that I did not submit, which I still like, I wanted to use the same phrase.
There were wonderful experiments by Bruno Munari on letterforms some years ago -- sort of, see how far you could go and still be able to read them.
And that idea stuck in my head.
But then I took the pieces that I had taken off and put them at the bottom.
And, of course those are the remains, and they're so labeled.
But what really happens is that you read it as: "Art is whatever remains."
Thank you.

<title>Milton Glaser: Using design to make ideas new</title>
<description>From the archives: The legendary graphic designer Milton Glaser dives deep into a new painting inspired by Piero della Francesca. From here, he muses on what makes a convincing poster, by breaking down an idea and making it new.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/david_pizarro_the_strange_politics_of_disgust.html</url>
In the 17th century, a woman named Giulia Tofana had a very successful perfume business.
For over 50 years she ran it.
It sort of ended abruptly when she was executed — — for murdering 600 men. You see, it wasn't a very good perfume.
In fact, it was completely odorless and tasteless and colorless, but as a poison, it was the best money could buy, so women flocked to her in order to murder their husbands.
It turns out that poisoners were a valued and feared group, because poisoning a human being is a quite difficult thing.
The reason is, we have sort of a built-in poison detector.
You can see this as early as even in newborn infants.
If you are willing to do this, you can take a couple of drops of a bitter substance or a sour substance, and you'll see that face, the tongue stick out, the wrinkled nose, as if they're trying to get rid of what's in their mouth.
This reaction expands into adulthood and becomes sort of a full-blown disgust response, no longer just about whether or not we're about to be poisoned, but whenever there's a threat of physical contamination from some source. But the face remains strikingly similar.
It has expanded more, though, than just keeping us away from physical contaminants, and there's a growing body of evidence to suggest that, in fact, this emotion of disgust now influences our moral beliefs and even our deeply held political intuitions.
Why this might be the case?
We can understand this process by understanding a little bit about emotions in general. So the basic human emotions, those kinds of emotions that we share with all other human beings, exist because they motivate us to do good things and they keep us away from doing bad things.
So by and large, they are good for our survival.
Take the emotion of fear, for instance. It keeps us away from doing things that are really, really risky.
This photo taken just before his death — — is actually a — No, one reason this photo is interesting is because most people would not do this, and if they did, they would not live to tell it, because fear would have kicked in a long time ago to a natural predator.
Just like fear offers us protective benefits, disgust seems to do the same thing, except for what disgust does is keeps us away from not things that might eat us, or heights, but rather things that might poison us, or give us disease and make us sick.
So one of the features of disgust that makes it such an interesting emotion is that it's very, very easy to elicit, in fact more so than probably any of the other basic emotions, and so I'm going to show you that with a couple of images I can probably make you feel disgust.
So turn away. I'll tell you when you can turn back.
I mean, you see it every day, right? I mean, come on.
Okay, turn back, if you didn't look.
Those probably made a lot of you in the audience feel very, very disgusted, but if you didn't look, I can tell you about some of the other things that have been shown sort of across the world to make people disgusted, things like feces, urine, blood, rotten flesh.
These are the sorts of things that it makes sense for us to stay away from, because they might actually contaminate us.
In fact, just having a diseased appearance or odd sexual acts, these things are also things that give us a lot of disgust.
Darwin was probably one of the first scientists to systematically investigate the human emotions, and he pointed to the universal nature and the strength of the disgust response.
This is an anecdote from his travels in South America.
"In Tierro del Fuego a native touched with his finger some cold preserved meat while I was eating ...
and plainly showed disgust at its softness, whilst I felt utter disgust at my food being touched by a naked savage — — though his hands did not appear dirty."
He later wrote, "It's okay, some of my best friends are naked savages."
Well it turns out it's not only old-timey British scientists who are this squeamish. I recently got a chance to talk to Richard Dawkins for a documentary, and I was able to disgust him a bunch of times. Here's my favorite.
Richard Dawkins: "We've evolved around courtship and sex, are attached to deep-rooted emotions and reactions that are hard to jettison overnight."
David Pizarro: So my favorite part of this clip is that Professor Dawkins actually gagged.
He jumps back, and he gags, and we had to do it three times, and all three times he gagged.
And he was really gagging. I thought he might throw up on me, actually.
One of the features, though, of disgust, is not just its universality and its strength, but the way that it works through association.
So when one disgusting thing touches a clean thing, that clean thing becomes disgusting, not the other way around.
This makes it very useful as a strategy if you want to convince somebody that an object or an individual or an entire social group is disgusting and should be avoided.
The philosopher Martha Nussbaum points this out in this quote: "Thus throughout history, certain disgust properties -- sliminess, bad smell, stickiness, decay, foulness -- have been repeatedly and monotonously been associated with ...
Jews, women, homosexuals, untouchables, lower-class people -- all of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt of the body."
Let me give you just some examples of how, some powerful examples of how this has been used historically.
This comes from a Nazi children's book published in 1938: "Just look at these guys! The louse-infested beards, the filthy, protruding ears, those stained, fatty clothes...
Jews often have an unpleasant sweetish odor.
If you have a good nose, you can smell the Jews."
A more modern example comes from people who try to convince us that homosexuality is immoral.
This is from an anti-gay website, where they said gays are "worthy of death for their vile ... sex practices."
They're like "dogs eating their own vomit and sows wallowing in their own feces."
These are disgust properties that are trying to be directly linked to the social group that you should not like.
When we were first investigating the role of disgust in moral judgment, one of the things we became interested in was whether or not these sorts of appeals are more likely to work in individuals who are more easily disgusted.
So while disgust, along with the other basic emotions, are universal phenomena, it just really is true that some people are easier to disgust than others.
You could probably see it in the audience members when I showed you those disgusting images.
The way that we measured this was by a scale that was constructed by some other psychologists that simply asked people across a wide variety of situations how likely they are to feel disgust.
So here are a couple of examples.
"Even if I were hungry, I would not drink a bowl of my favorite soup if it had been stirred by a used but thoroughly washed fly-swatter."
"Do you agree or disagree?"
"While you are walking through a tunnel under a railroad track, you smell urine. Would you be very disgusted or not at all disgusted?"
If you ask enough of these, you can get a general overall score of disgust sensitivity.
It turns out that this score is actually meaningful.
When you bring people into the laboratory and you ask them if they're willing to engage in safe but disgusting behaviors like eating chocolate that's been baked to look like dog poop, or in this case eating some mealworms that are perfectly healthy but pretty gross, your score on that scale actually predicts whether or not you'll be willing to engage in those behaviors.
The first time that we set out to collect data on this and associate it with political or moral beliefs, we found a general pattern -- this is with the psychologists Yoel Inbar and Paul Bloom -- that in fact, across three studies we kept finding that people who reported that they were easily disgusted also reported that they were more politically conservative.
Another way to say this, though, is that people who are very liberal are very hard to disgust.
In a more recent follow-up study, we were able to look at a much greater sample, a much larger sample. In this case, this is nearly 30,000 U.S. respondents, and we find the same pattern. As you can see, people who are on the very conservative side of answering the political orientation scale are also much more likely to report that they're easily disgusted.
This data set also allowed us to statistically control for a number of things that we knew were both related to political orientation and to disgust sensitivity.
So we were able to control for gender, age, income, education, even basic personality variables, and the result stays the same.
When we actually looked at not just self-reported political orientation, but voting behavior, we were able to look geographically across the nation. What we found was that in regions in which people reported high levels of disgust sensitivity, McCain got more votes.
So it not only predicted self-reported political orientation, but actual voting behavior. And also we were able, with this sample, to look across the world, in 121 different countries we asked the same questions, and as you can see, this is 121 countries collapsed into 10 different geographical regions.
No matter where you look, what this is plotting is the size of the relationship between disgust sensitivity and political orientation, and no matter where we looked, we saw a very similar effect.
Other labs have actually looked at this as well using different measures of disgust sensitivity, so rather than asking people how easily disgusted they are, they hook people up to physiological measures, in this case skin conductance.
And what they've demonstrated is that people who report being more politically conservative are also more physiologically aroused when you show them disgusting images like the ones that I showed you.
Interestingly, what they also showed in a finding that we kept getting in our previous studies as well was that one of the strongest influences here is that individuals who are very disgust-sensitive not only are more likely to report being politically conservative, but they're also very much more opposed to gay marriage and homosexuality and pretty much a lot of the socio-moral issues in the sexual domain.
So physiological arousal predicted, in this study, attitudes toward gay marriage.
But even with all these data linking disgust sensitivity and political orientation, one of the questions that remains is what is the causal link here? Is it the case that disgust really is shaping political and moral beliefs?
We have to resort to experimental methods to answer this, and so what we can do is actually bring people into the lab and disgust them and compare them to a control group that hasn't been disgusted. It turns out that over the past five years a number of researchers have done this, and by and large the results have all been the same, that when people are feeling disgust, their attitudes shift towards the right of the political spectrum, toward more moral conservatism as well.
So this is whether you use a foul odor, a bad taste, from film clips, from post-hypnotic suggestions of disgust, images like the ones I've shown you, even just reminding people that disease is prevalent and they should be wary of it and wash up, right, to keep clean, these all have similar effects on judgment.
Let me just give you an example from a recent study that we conducted. We asked participants to just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups, and we either made the room smell gross or not.
When the room smelled gross, what we saw was that individuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men.
Disgust didn't influence attitudes toward all the other social groups that we asked, including African-Americans, the elderly. It really came down to the attitudes they had toward gay men.
In another set of studies we actually simply reminded people -- this was at a time when the swine flu was going around -- we reminded people that in order to prevent the spread of the flu that they ought to wash their hands.
For some participants, we actually had them take questionnaires next to a sign that reminded them to wash their hands.
And what we found was that just taking a questionnaire next to this hand-sanitizing reminder made individuals report being more politically conservative.
And when we asked them a variety of questions about the rightness or wrongness of certain acts, what we also found was that simply being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them more morally conservative.
In particular, when we asked them questions about sort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices, just being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them think that they were more morally wrong.
Let me give you an example of what I mean by harmless but taboo sexual practice. We gave them scenarios.
One of them said a man is house-sitting for his grandmother.
When his grandmother's away, he has sex with his girlfriend on his grandma's bed.
In another one, we said a woman enjoys masturbating with her favorite teddy bear cuddled next to her.
People find these to be more morally abhorrent if they've been reminded to wash their hands.
Okay. The fact that emotions influence our judgment should come as no surprise. I mean, that's part of how emotions work.
They not only motivate you to behave in certain ways, but they change the way you think.
In the case of disgust, what is a little bit more surprising is the scope of this influence. It makes perfect sense, and it's a very good emotion for us to have, that disgust would make me change the way that I perceive the physical world whenever contamination is possible.
It makes less sense that an emotion that was built to prevent me from ingesting poison should predict who I'm going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election.
The question of whether disgust ought to influence our moral and political judgments certainly has to be complex, and might depend on exactly what judgments we're talking about, and as a scientist, we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method is just ill-equipped to answer these sorts of questions.
But one thing that I am fairly certain about is, at the very least, what we can do with this research is point to what questions we ought to ask in the first place.
Thank you.

<title>David Pizarro: The strange politics of disgust</title>
<description>What does a disgusting image have to do with how you vote? Equipped with surveys and experiments, psychologist David Pizarro demonstrates a correlation between sensitivity to disgusting cues -- a photo of feces, an unpleasant odor -- and moral and political conservatism. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/newton_aduaka_tells_the_story_of_ezra.html</url>
This is very strange for me, because I'm not used to doing this: I usually stand on the other side of the light, and now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into. And it's hard ...
The previous speaker has, I think, really painted a very good background as to the impulse behind my work and what drives me, and my sense of loss, and trying to find the answer to the big questions.
But this, for me, I mean, coming here to do this, feels like -- there's this sculptor that I like very much, Giacometti, who after many years of living in France -- and learning, you know, studying and working -- he returned home and he was asked, what did you produce?
What have you done with so many years of being away?
And he sort of, he showed a handful of figurines.
And obviously they were, "Is this what you spent years doing?
And we expected huge masterpieces!"
But what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a man's life, search, thought, everything -- just in a reduced, small version.
In a way, I feel like that.
I feel like I'm coming home to talk about what I've been away doing for 20 years.
And I will start with a brief taster of what I've been about: a handful of films -- nothing much, two feature films and a handful of short films.
So, we'll go with the first piece.
"I destroy lives," mum said.
I love her, you know.
She's not even my real mum.
My real mum and dad dumped me and fucked off back to Nigeria.
The devil is in me, Court.
Court: Sleep.
Have you ever been?
Court: Where?
Nigeria.
Court: Never.
My mum wanted to, couldn't afford it.
Wish I could.
I have this feeling I'd be happy there.
Why does everyone get rid of me?
Court: I don't want to get rid of you.
You don't need me.
You're just too blind to see it now.
Boy: What do you do all day?
Marcus: Read.
Boy: Don't you get bored?
And how come you ain't got a job anyway?
Marcus: I am retired.
Boy: So?
Marcus: So I've done my bit for Queen and country, now I work for myself.
Boy: No, now you sit around like a bum all day.
Marcus: Because I do what I like?
Boy: Look man, reading don't feed no one.
And it particularly don't feed your spliff habit.
Marcus: It feeds my mind and my soul.
Boy: Arguing with you is a waste of time, Marcus.
Marcus: You're a rapper, am I right?
Boy: Yeah.
Marcus: A modern day poet.
Boy: Yeah, you could say that.
Marcus: So what do you talk about?
Boy: What's that supposed to mean?
Marcus: Simple. What do you rap about?
Boy: Reality, man.
Marcus: Whose reality?
Boy: My fuckin' reality.
Marcus: Tell me about your reality.
Boy: Racism, oppression, people like me not getting a break in life.
Marcus: So what solutions do you offer? I mean, the job of a poet is not just -- Boy: Man, fight the power! Simple: blow the motherfuckers out of the sky.
Marcus: With an AK-47?
Boy: Man, if I had one, too fuckin' right.
Marcus: And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you?
Boy: Oh, Marcus, you know what I mean.
Marcus: When a man resorts to profanities, it's a sure sign of his inability to express himself.
Boy: See man, you're just taking the piss out of me now.
Marcus: The Panthers.
Boy: Panthers?
Ass kickin' guys who were fed up with all that white supremacist, powers-that-be bullshit, and just went in there and kicked everybody's arse.
Fuckin' wicked, man. I saw the movie. Bad! What?
Director 1: I saw his last film.
Épuise, right?
Woman 1: Yes.
D1: Not to make a bad joke, but it was really épuisé.
Epuisé -- tired, exhausted, fed up.
Director 2: Can you not shut up?
Now, you talk straight to me, what's wrong with my films?
Let's go.
W1: They suck.
They suck? What about yours?
What, what, what, what about, what?
What do you think about your movie?
D1: My movies, they are OK, fine.
They are better than making documentaries no one ever sees.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Did you ever move your fuckin' ass from Hollywood to go and film something real?
You make people fuckin' sleep.
Dream about bullshit.
Newton Aduaka: Thank you. The first clip, really, is totally trying to capture what cinema is for me, and where I'm coming from in terms of cinema.
The first piece was, really, there's a young woman talking about Nigeria, that she has a feeling she'll be happy there.
These are the sentiments of someone that's been away from home.
And that was something that I went through, you know, and I'm still going through.
I've not been home for quite a while, for about five years now.
I've been away 20 years in total.
And so it's really -- it's really how suddenly, you know, this was made in 1997, which is the time of Abacha -- the military dictatorship, the worst part of Nigerian history, this post-colonial history.
So, for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is.
How -- and it's sort of, perhaps romantic, but I think beautiful, because you just need something to hold on to, especially in a society where you feel alienated.
Which takes us to the next piece, where the young man talks about lack of opportunity: living as a black person in Europe, the glass ceiling that we all know about, that we all talk about, and his reality.
Again, this was my -- this was me talking about -- this was, again, the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom, and there was this buzzword -- and it was trying to say, what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people?
And what would a child -- what does a child like Jamie -- the young boy -- think, I mean, with all this anger that's built up inside of him?
What happens with that?
What, of course, happens with that is violence, which we see when we talk about the ghettos and we talk about, you know, South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff, and which eventually, when channeled, becomes, you know, evolves and manifests itself as riots -- like the one in France two years ago, where I live, which shocked everybody, because everyone thought, "Oh well, France is a liberal society."
But I lived in England for 18 years.
I've lived in France for about four, and I feel actually thrown back 20 years, living in France.
And then, the third piece. The third piece for me is the question: What is cinema to you? What do you do with cinema?
There's a young director, Hollywood director, with his friends -- fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means.
I suppose that will take me to my last piece -- what cinema means for me.
My life started as a -- I started life in 1966, a few months before the Biafran, which lasted for three years and it was three years of war.
So that whole thing, that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece.
Voice: Onicha, off to school with your brother.
Onicha: Yes, mama.
Commander: Soldiers, you are going to fight a battle, so you must get ready and willing to die.
You must get -- ?
Child Soldiers: Ready and willing to die.
C: Success, the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun.
CS: The barrel of the gun!
C: This is the gun.
CS: This is the gun.
C: This is an AK-47 rifle. This is your life.
This is your life. This is ... this is ... this is your life.
Ezra: They give us the special drugs. We call it bubbles.
Amphetamines.
Soldiers: Rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.
I say rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.
We went from one village to another -- three villages.
I don't remember how we got there.
Witness: We walked and walked for two days.
We didn't eat.
There was no food, just little rice.
Without food -- I was sick.
The injection made us not to have mind.
God will forgive us.
He knows we did not know. We did not know!
Committee Chairman: Do you remember January 6th, 1999?
Ezra: I don't remember.
Various Voices: You will die! You will die!
Onicha: Ezra!
Various Voices: We don't need no more trouble No more trouble They killed my mother.
The Mende sons of bastards.
Who is she?
Me.
Why you giving these to me?
So you can stop staring at me.
My story is a little bit complicated.
I'm interested.
Mariam is pregnant.
You know what you are? A crocodile.
Big mouth. Short legs.
In front of Rufus you are Ezra the coward.
He's not taking care of his troops.
Troop, pay your last honor. Salute.
Open your eyes, Ezra.
A blind man can see that the diamonds end up in his pocket.
We don't need no more trouble Get that idiot out!
I take you are preparing a major attack?
This must be the mine.
Your girl is here.
Well done, well done.
That is what you are here for, no?
You are planning to go back to fight are you?
We don't need no more trouble No more trouble We don't need no more trouble No more trouble. Wake up! Everybody wake up. Road block!
We don't need no more ... Committee Chairman: We hope that, with your help and the help of others, that this commission will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war.
More than that, begin a healing process and finally to -- as an act of closure to a terrible period in this country's history.
The beginning of hope.
Mr. Ezra Gelehun, please stand.
State your name and age for the commission.
Ezra: My name is Ezra Gelehun.
I am 15 or 16. I don't remember.
Ask my sister, she is the witch, she knows everything.
CC: Mr. Gelehun, I'd like to remind you you're not on trial here for any crimes you committed.
E: We were fighting for our freedom.
If killing in a war is a crime, then you have to charge every soldier in the world.
War is a crime, yes, but I did not start it.
You too are a retired General, not so?
CC: Yes, correct.
E: So you too must stand trial then.
Our government was corrupt.
Lack of education was their way to control power.
If I may ask, do you pay for school in your country?
CC: No, we don't.
E: You are richer than us.
But we pay for school.
Your country talks about democracy, but you support corrupt governments like my own.
Why? Because you want our diamond.
Ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before?
No.
CC: Mr. Gelehun, I'd like to remind you, you're not on trial here today.
You are not on trial.
E: Then let me go.
CC: I can't do that, son.
E: So you are a liar.
N Thank you. Just very quickly to say that my point really here, is that while we're making all these huge advancements, what we're doing, which for me, you know, I think we should -- Africa should move forward, but we should remember, so we do not go back here again.
Thank you.
Emeka Okafor: Thank you, Newton.
One of the themes that comes through very strongly in the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young that have to play this role of being child soldiers.
And considering where you are coming from, and when we consider the extent to which it's not taken as seriously as it should be, what would you have to say about that?
N In the process of my research, I actually spent a bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this.
And I remember I met a lot of child soldiers -- ex-combatants, as they like to be called.
I met psychosocial workers who worked with them.
I met psychiatrists who spent time with them, aid workers, NGOs, the whole lot.
But I remember on the flight back on my last trip, I remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself, if any kid in the West, in the western world, went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through, they will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives.
So for me, the thought that we have all these children -- it's a generation, we have a whole generation of children -- who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage, and Africa has to live with that.
But I'm just saying to factor that in, factor that in with all this great advancement, all this pronouncement of great achievement.
That's really my thinking.
EO: Well, we thank you again for coming to the TED stage.
That was a very moving piece.
N Thank you.
EO: Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/mike_matas.html</url>
So for the past year and a half, my team at Push Pop Press and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media have been working on creating the first feature-length interactive book.
It's called "Our Choice" and the author is Al Gore.
It's the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth," and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis.
The book starts like this. This is the cover.
As the globe spins, we can see our location, and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book.
Or, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom.
And if we wanted to zoom into a page, we can just open it up.
And anything you see in the book, you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up.
And if you want to go back and read the book again, you just fold it back up and put it back on the page.
And so this works the same way; you pick it up and pop it open.
I consider myself among the majority who look at windmills and feel they're a beautiful addition to the landscape.
Mike Matas: And so throughout the whole book, Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos.
This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map.
Zoom into it and see where it was taken.
And throughout the book, there's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations.
So you can open this one.
AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ...
MM: It starts playing immediately.
And while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page, and the movie keeps playing.
Or we can zoom out to the table of contents, and the video keeps playing.
But one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics.
This one shows the wind potential all around the United States.
But instead of just showing us the information, we can take our finger and explore, and see, state by state, exactly how much wind potential there is.
We can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power.
This is one of my favorites.
So this shows ...
When the wind is blowing, any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery.
And as the wind starts dying down, any excess energy will be diverted back into the house -- the lights never go out.
And this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad.
It also runs on the iPhone.
And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone.
And it works the exact same way.
You can pinch into any page.
Open it up.
So that's Push Pop Press' first title, Al Gore's "Our Choice."
Thank you.
That's spectacular.
Do you want to be a publisher, a technology licenser?
What is the business here?
Is this something that other people can do?
MM: Yeah, we're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content.
So Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast -- and we're on the West coast, building the software -- takes our tool and, every day, drags in images and text.
So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that?
All right. Mike, thanks so much.
MM: Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/frank_gehry_asks_then_what.html</url>
Frank Gehry: I listened to this scientist this morning.
Dr. Mullis was talking about his experiments, and I realized that I almost became a scientist.
When I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set and I decided to make water.
So, I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator, and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker and I threw a match in.
And the glass -- luckily I turned around -- I had it all in my back and I was about 15 feet away.
The wall was covered with ...
I had an explosion.
Richard Saul Wurman: Really?
FG: People on the street came and knocked on the door to see if I was okay.
RSW: ... huh.
I'd like to start this session again.
The gentleman to my left is the very famous, perhaps overly famous, Frank Gehry.
And Frank, you've come to a place in your life, which is astonishing.
I mean it is astonishing for an artist, for an architect, to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time.
I mean you have become, whether you can giggle at it because it's a funny ... you know, it's a strange thought, but your building is an icon -- you can draw a little picture of that building, it can be used in ads -- and you've had not rock star status, but celebrity status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life.
And I know the road was extremely difficult.
And it didn't seem, at least, that your sell outs, whatever they were, were very big.
You kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent on working for somebody.
But that's an interesting thing for a creative person.
A lot of us work for people; we're in the hands of other people.
And that's one of the great dilemmas -- we're in a creativity session -- it's one of the great dilemmas in creativity: how to do work that's big enough and not sell out.
And you've achieved that and that makes your win doubly big, triply big.
It's not quite a question but you can comment on it.
It's a big issue.
FG: Well, I've always just ...
I've never really gone out looking for work.
I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head.
And when I started out, I thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff.
And I realized when I'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff, and people would just look at me like I'd just landed from Mars.
But I couldn't do anything else.
That was my response to the people in the time.
And actually, it was responding to clients that I had who didn't have very much money, so they couldn't afford very much.
I think it was circumstantial.
Until I got to my house, where the client was my wife.
We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica and for like 50 grand I built a house around it.
And a few people got excited about it.
I was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer, out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere.
He's building this huge concrete place.
And it was late in the evening. We'd had a lot to drink.
We were standing out in the desert all alone and, thinking about my house, he said, "Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent, somewhere in 2000 years somebody's going to like it?"
So, I thought, "Yeah, that's probably a good idea."
Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money, so the stuff was a little more permanent.
But I just found out the world ain't going to last that long, this guy was telling us the other day.
So where do we go now?
Back to -- everything's so temporary.
I don't see it the way you characterized it.
For me, every day is a new thing.
I approach each project with a new insecurity, almost like the first project I ever did, and I get the sweats, I go in and start working, I'm not sure where I'm going -- if I knew where I was going, I wouldn't do it.
When I can predict or plan it, I don't do it.
I discard it.
So I approach it with the same trepidation.
Obviously, over time I have a lot more confidence that it's going to be OK.
I do run a kind of a business -- I've got 120 people and you've got to pay them, so there's a lot of responsibility involved -- but the actual work on the project is with, I think, a healthy insecurity.
And like the playwright said the other day -- I could relate to him: you're not sure.
When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it, I saw all the mistakes, I saw ...
They weren't mistakes; I saw everything that I would have changed and I was embarrassed by it.
I felt an embarrassment -- "How could I have done that?
How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that?"
It's taken several years to now look at it detached and say -- as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road and the street, and it appears to have a relationship -- that I started to like it.
RSW: What's the status of the New York project?
FG: I don't really know.
Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me, and I thought he was nuts.
I didn't think he knew what he was doing, and he pulled it off.
So, I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy.
He gets up there and then he ... comes back up.
They're still talking about it.
September 11 generated some interest in moving it over to Ground Zero, and I'm totally against that.
I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero I think for a long time.
RSW: The picture on the screen, is that Disney?
FG: Yeah.
RSW: How much further along is it than that, and when will that be finished?
FG: That will be finished in 2003 -- September, October -- and I'm hoping Kyu, and Herbie, and Yo-Yo and all those guys come play with us at that place.
Luckily, today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like.
Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that Disney Hall came to me.
He's been a cheerleader for quite a long time.
There aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients.
If you think about the world, and even just in this audience, most of us are involved with buildings.
Nothing that you would call architecture, right?
And so to find one, a guy like that, you hang on to him.
He's become the head of Art Center, and there's a building by Craig Ellwood there.
I knew Craig and respected him.
They want to add to it and it's hard to add to a building like that -- it's a beautiful, minimalist, black steel building -- and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff and it's a lot of acreage.
I convinced him to let me bring in another architect from Portugal: Alvaro Siza.
RSW: Why did you want that?
FG: I knew you'd ask that question.
It was intuitive.
Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture.
I visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work, and his early work had a resemblance to my early work.
When I came out of college, I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California, and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that.
I tried to understand that language as a beginning, as a place to jump off, and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't ...
I just stopped.
I mean, Charlie Moore did a bunch of it, but it didn't feel good to me.
Siza, on the other hand, continued in Portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language.
And I always felt that he should come to Southern California and do a building.
I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out.
I like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you.
I've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra, who doesn't think architecture is art.
Did you see that thing?
RSW: No. What did he say?
FG: He calls architecture "plumbing."
FG: Anyway, the Siza thing.
It's a richer experience.
It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians -- it's similar to that I would imagine -- where you ... huh?
Audience: Liquid architecture.
FG: Liquid architecture.
Where you ... It's like jazz: you improvise, you work together, you play off each other, you make something, they make something.
And I think for me, it's a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city.
RSW: Is it going to be near the current campus?
Or is it going to be down near ...
FG: No, it's near the current campus.
Anyway, he's that kind of patron.
It's not his money, of course.
RSW: What's his schedule on that?
FG: I don't know.
What's the schedule, Richard?
Richard Koshalek: [Unclear] starts from 2004.
FG: 2004.
You can come to the opening. I'll invite you.
No, but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos, right?
Everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment, and if you can figure out how to work off each other -- if you can get a bunch of people who respect each other's work and play off each other, you might be able to create models for how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect.
Like the Rockefeller Center model, which is kind of from another era.
RSW: I found the most remarkable thing.
My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building, you go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces.
I'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED.
The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city.
That was the surprise of going across the river, of going on the highway around it, of walking down the street and finding it.
That was the real surprise of Bilbao.
FG: But you know, Richard, most architects when they present their work -- most of the people we know, you get up and you talk about your work, and it's almost like you tell everybody you're a good guy by saying, "Look, I'm worried about the context, I'm worried about the city, I'm worried about my client, I worry about budget, that I'm on time."
Blah, blah, blah and all that stuff.
And it's like cleansing yourself so that you can ...
by saying all that, it means your work is good somehow.
And I think everybody -- I mean that should be a matter of fact, like gravity.
You're not going to defy gravity.
You've got to work with the building department.
If you don't meet the budgets, you're not going to get much work.
If it leaks -- Bilbao did not leak.
I was so proud.
The MIT project -- they were interviewing me for MIT and they sent their facilities people to Bilbao.
I met them in Bilbao.
They came for three days.
RSW: This is the computer building?
FG: Yeah, the computer building.
They were there three days and it rained every day and they kept walking around -- I noticed they were looking under things and looking for things, and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden, you know?
People put buckets out ...
I was clean. There wasn't a bloody leak in the place, it was just fantastic.
But you've got to -- yeah, well up until then every building leaked, so this ...
RSW: Frank had a sort of ...
FG: Ask Miriam!
RW: ... sort of had a fame. His fame was built on that in L.A. for a while.
FG: You've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story, when the woman called and said, "Mr. Wright, I'm sitting on the couch and the water's pouring in on my head."
And he said, "Madam, move your chair."
So, some years later I was doing a building, a little house on the beach for Norton Simon, and his secretary, who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady, called me and said, "Mr. Simon's sitting at his desk and the water's coming in on his head."
And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story.
RSW: Didn't get a laugh.
FG: No. Not now either.
But my point is that ... and I call it the "then what?"
OK, you solved all the problems, you did all the stuff, you made nice, you loved your clients, you loved the city, you're a good guy, you're a good person ...
and then what?
What do you bring to it?
And I think that's what I've always been interested in, is that -- which is a personal kind of expression.
Bilbao, I think, shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases that are necessary of fitting into the city.
That's what reminded me of it.
And I think that's the issue, you know; it's the "then what" that most clients who hire architects -- most clients aren't hiring architects for that.
They're hiring them to get it done, get it on budget, be polite, and they're missing out on the real value of an architect.
RSW: At a certain point a number of years ago, people -- when Michael Graves was a fashion, before teapots ...
FG: I did a teapot and nobody bought it.
RSW: Did it leak?
FG: No.
RSW: ... people wanted a Michael Graves building.
Is that a curse, that people want a Bilbao building?
FG: Yeah.
Since Bilbao opened, which is now four, five years, both Krens and I have been called with at least 100 opportunities -- China, Brazil, other parts of Spain -- to come in and do the Bilbao effect.
And I've met with some of these people.
Usually I say no right away, but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well-intentioned and they get you for at least one or two meetings.
In one case, I flew all the way to Malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city, and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port.
I asked them what kind of building it was.
"When you get here we'll explain it." Blah, blah, blah.
So four of us went.
And they took us -- they put us up in a great hotel and we were looking over the bay, and then they took us in a boat out in the water and showed us all these sights in the harbor.
Each one was more beautiful than the other.
And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in Malaga.
Just before going to lunch with the mayor, we went to the harbor commissioner.
It was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here, and I was here, and my guys.
We sat down, and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet.
And the guy looked at me and said, "Now what can I do for you, Mr. Gehry?"
RSW: Oh, my God.
FG: So, I got up.
I said to my team, "Let's get out of here."
We stood up, we walked out.
They followed -- the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said, "You mean you're not going to have lunch with the mayor?"
I said, "Nope."
"You're not going to have dinner at all?"
They just brought us there to hustle this group, you know, to create a project.
And we get a lot of that.
Luckily, I'm old enough that I can complain I can't travel.
I don't have my own plane yet.
RSW: Well, I'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it's been very long.
But let me just say a couple words.
FG: Can I say something?
Are you going to talk about me or you?
RSW: Once a shit, always a shit!
FG: Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody, so ...
RSW: You're going to get one! You're going to get one!
I'm going to make it for you!
FG: No, no. Wait a minute!

<title>Frank Gehry: A master architect asks, Now what?</title>
<description>In a wildly entertaining discussion with Richard Saul Wurman, architect Frank Gehry gives TEDsters his take on the power of failure, his recent buildings, and the all-important "Then what?" factor.</description>
<keywords>architecture,arts,business,creativity,culture,design,interview,invention</keywords>
<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/edward_burtynsky_on_manufactured_landscapes.html</url>
Walk around for four months with three wishes, and all the ideas will start to percolate up.
I think everybody should do it -- think that you've got three wishes.
And what would you do? It's actually a great exercise to really drill down to the things that you feel are important, and really reflect on the world around us.
And thinking that, can an individual actually do something, or come up with something, that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference?
Inspired by nature -- that's the theme here.
And I think, quite frankly, that's where I started.
I became very interested in the landscape as a Canadian.
We have this Great North. And there was a pretty small population, and my father was an avid outdoorsman.
So I really had a chance to experience that.
And I could never really understand exactly what it was, or how it was informing me.
But what I think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening, and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines, the untouched forest that I was able to see -- really bring in a sense of that geological time, that this has gone on for a long time, and we're experiencing it in a different way.
And that, to me, was a reference point that I think I needed to have to be able to make the work that I did.
And I did go out, and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring, along a roadside.
This rebirth of grass. And then I went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape.
But as a fine-art photographer I somehow felt that it wouldn't catch on out there, that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career.
And I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture, or something of that nature, and I couldn't get away from it.
So I started to think of, how can I rethink the landscape?
I decided to rethink the landscape as the landscape that we've transformed.
I had a bit of an epiphany being lost in Pennsylvania, and I took a left turn trying to get back to the highway.
And I ended up in a town called Frackville.
I got out of the car, and I stood up, and it was a coal-mining town. I did a 360 turnaround, and that became one of the most surreal landscapes I've ever seen.
Totally transformed by man.
And that got me to go out and look at mines like this, and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions in the landscape that I could find.
And that became the baseline of what I was doing.
And it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto, and not have to re-invent myself -- that this theme was large enough to become a life's work, to become something that I could sink my teeth into and just research and find out where these industries are.
And I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my thanks, which I kind of missed, was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in.
Because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs -- to get into that place to make those photographs, and if it wasn't for those people letting me in at the heads of those corporations, I would have never made this body of work.
So in that respect, to me, I'm not against the corporation.
I own a corporation. I work with them, and I feel that we all need them and they're important.
But I am also for sustainability.
So there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions.
And I'm not making an indictment towards what's happening here, but it is a slow progression.
So I started thinking, well, we live in all these ages of man: the Stone Age, and the Iron Age, and the Copper Age.
And these ages of man are still at work today.
But we've become totally disconnected from them.
There's something that we're not seeing there.
And it's a scary thing as well. Because when we start looking at the collective appetite for our lifestyles, and what we're doing to that landscape -- that, to me, is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate.
And through my photographs, I'm hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work, and to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image.
Not to say, "Oh my God, what is it?" but to be challenged by it -- to say, "Wow, this is beautiful," on one level, but on the other level, "This is scary. I shouldn't be enjoying it."
Like a forbidden pleasure. And it's that forbidden pleasure that I think is what resonates out there, and it gets people to look at these things, and it gets people to enter it. And it also, in a way, defines kind of what I feel, too -- that I'm drawn to have a good life.
I want a house, and I want a car.
But there's this consequence out there.
And how do I begin to have that attraction, repulsion?
It's even in my own conscience I'm having it, and here in my work, I'm trying to build that same toggle.
These things that I photographed -- this tire pile here had 45 million tires in it. It was the largest one.
It was only about an hour-and-a-half away from me, and it caught fire about four years ago. It's around Westley, California, around Modesto.
And I decided to start looking at something that, to me, had -- if the earlier work of looking at the landscape had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature, in the recycling work that you're seeing here was starting to point to a direction. To me, it was our redemption.
That in the recycling work that I was doing, I'm looking for a practice, a human activity that is sustainable.
That if we keep putting things, through industrial and urban existence, back into the system -- if we keep doing that -- we can continue on.
Of course, listening at the conference, there's many, many things that are coming. Bio-mimicry, and there's many other things that are coming on stream -- nanotechnology that may also prevent us from having to go into that landscape and tear it apart.
And we all look forward to those things.
But in the meantime, these things are scaling up.
These things are continuing to happen.
What you're looking at here -- I went to Bangladesh, so I started to move away from North America; I started to look at our world globally.
These images of Bangladesh came out of a radio program I was listening to.
They were talking about Exxon Valdez, and that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers because of the insurance industries.
And that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned, and 2004 was going to be the pinnacle.
And I thought, "My God, wouldn't that be something?"
To see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand, literally, in third-world countries.
So originally I was going to go to India.
And I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there, and then I was able to get into Bangladesh, and saw for the first time a third world, a view of it, that I had never actually thought was possible.
130 million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin -- people everywhere -- the pollution was intense, and the working conditions were horrible.
Here you're looking at some oil fields in California, some of the biggest oil fields. And again, I started to think that -- there was another epiphany -- that the whole world I was living in was a result of having plentiful oil.
And that, to me, was again something that I started building on, and I continued to build on.
So this is a series I'm hoping to have ready in about two or three years, under the heading of "The Oil Party."
Because I think everything that we're involved in -- our clothing, our cars, our roads, and everything -- are directly a result.
I'm going to move to some pictures of China.
And for me China -- I started photographing it four years ago, and China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind, not to mention that China, as well, has a great effect on the industries that I grew up around.
I came out of a blue-collar town, a GM town, and my father worked at GM, so I was very familiar with that kind of industry and that also informed my work. But you know, to see China and the scale at which it's evolving, is quite something.
So what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam, and this is the largest dam by 50 percent ever attempted by man.
Most of the engineers around the world left the project because they said, "It's just too big."
In fact, when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago, they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning.
It took fifteen days to fill it.
So this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long, one of the largest reservoirs ever created.
And what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir, and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships.
This is a "before and after." So that was before.
And this is like 10 weeks later, demolished by hand.
I think 11 of the buildings they used dynamite, everything else was by hand. That was 10 weeks later.
And this gives you an idea.
And it was all the people who lived in those homes, were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working, and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart.
And these are some of the images from that.
So I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam, looking at that massive transformation of a landscape.
And it looks like a bombed-out landscape, but it isn't.
What it is, it's a landscape that is an intentional one.
This is a need for power, and they're willing to go through this massive transformation, on this scale, to get that power.
And again, it's actually a relief for what's going on in China because I think on the table right now, there's 27 nuclear power stations to be built.
There hasn't been one built in North America for 20 years because of the "NIMBY" problem -- "Not In My BackYard."
But in China they're saying, "No, we're putting in 27 in the next 10 years."
And coal-burning furnaces are going in there for hydroelectric power literally weekly.
So coal itself is probably one of the largest problems.
And one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges -- a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost; some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that.
And 1.2 to 2 million people were relocated, depending on whose statistics you're looking at.
And this is what they were building.
This is Wushan, one of the largest cities that was relocated.
This is the town hall for the city.
And again, the rebuilding of the city -- to me, it was sad to see that they didn't really grab a lot of, I guess, what we know here, in terms of urban planning.
There were no parks; there were no green spaces.
Very high-density living on the side of a hill.
And here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up, but somehow were not connecting with them.
Here is a sign that, translated, says, "Obey the birth control law.
Build our science, civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth."
So here, if you look at this poster, it has all the trappings of Western culture.
You're seeing the tuxedos, the bouquets.
But what's really, to me, frightening about the picture and about this billboard is the refinery in the background.
So it's like marrying up all the things that we have and it's an adaptation of our way of life, full stop.
And again, when you start seeing that kind of embrace, and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle with a very, very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle with a much higher footprint, it starts to become very sobering.
This is a shot in one of the biggest squares in Guangdong -- and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country.
And there's about 130 million people in migration trying to get into urban centers at all times, and in the next 10 to 15 years, are expecting another 400 to 500 million people to migrate into the urban centers like Shanghai and the manufacturing centers.
The manufacturers are -- the domestics are usually -- you can tell a domestic factory by the fact that they all use the same color uniforms.
So this is a pink uniform at this factory. It's a shoe factory.
And they have dorms for the workers.
So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms.
This is one of the biggest shoe factories, the Yuyuan shoe factory near Shenzhen. It has 90,000 employees making shoes.
This is a shift change, one of three.
There's two factories of this scale in the same town.
This is one with 45,000, so every lunch, there's about 12,000 coming through for lunch.
They sit down; they have about 20 minutes.
The next round comes in. It's an incredible workforce that's building there. Shanghai -- I'm looking at the urban renewal in Shanghai, and this is a whole area that will be flattened and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years.
What's also happening in Shanghai is -- China is changing because this wouldn't have happened five years ago, for instance. This is a holdout.
They're called dengzahoos -- they're like pin tacks to the ground.
They won't move. They're not negotiating.
They're not getting enough, so they're not going to move.
And so they're holding off until they get a deal with them.
And they've been actually quite successful in getting better deals because most of them are getting a raw deal.
They're being put out about two hours -- the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years, or maybe even thousands of years, are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas outside of Shanghai. But these are a whole series of guys holding out in this reconstruction of Shanghai.
Probably the largest urban-renewal project, I think, ever attempted on the planet.
And then the embrace of the things that they're replacing it with -- again, one of my wishes, and I never ended up going there, was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house.
The kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something, and these are called the villas.
And also, like right now, they're just moving.
The scaffolding is still on, and this is an e-waste area, and if you looked in the foreground on the big print, you'd see that the industry -- their industry -- they're all recycling.
So the industry's already growing around these new developments.
This is a five-level bridge in Shanghai.
Shanghai was a very intriguing city -- it's exploding on a level that I don't think any city has experienced.
In fact, even Shenzhen, the economic zone -- one of the first ones -- 15 years ago was about 100,000 people, and today it boasts about 10 to 11 million.
So that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which -- this is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen.
There's 9,000 of them here, and they're being built for most of the big cities, Beijing and Shanghai, Shenzhen.
And this isn't even the domestic car market; this is the taxi market.
And what we would see here as a suburban development -- a similar thing, but they're all high-rises.
So they'll put 20 or 40 up at a time, and they just go up in the same way as a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area.
And the density is quite incredible.
And one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out is that when I saw these kinds of buildings, I was shocked to see that they're not using a central air-conditioning system; every window has an air conditioner in it.
And I'm sure there are people here who probably know better than I do about efficiencies, but I can't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale.
And when you start looking at that, and then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai, it's literally a forest of skyscrapers.
It's breathtaking, in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming.
And you can see in the foreground of this picture, it's still one of the last areas that was being held up.
Right now that's all cleared out -- this was done about eight months ago -- and high-rises are now going up into that central spot.
So a skyscraper is built, literally, overnight in Shanghai.
Most recently I went in, and I started looking at some of the biggest industries in China.
And this is Baosteel, right outside of Shanghai.
This is the coal supply for the steel factory -- 18 square kilometers.
It's an incredibly massive operation, I think 15,000 workers, five cupolas, and the sixth one's coming in here.
So they're building very large blast furnaces to try to deal with the demand for steel in China.
So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot.
And again, looking at these images, there's this constant, like, haze that you're seeing.
This is going to show you, real time, an assembler. It's a circuit breaker.
10 hours a day at this speed.
I think one of the issues that we here are facing with China, is that they're using a lot of the latest production technology.
In that one, there were 400 people that worked on the floor.
And I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers, and then I went and looked at each one of them for about 15 or 20 minutes, and picked this one woman.
And it was just lightning fast; the way she was working was almost unbelievable.
But that is the trick that they've got right now, that they're winning with, is that they're using all the latest technologies and extrusion machines, and bringing all the components into play, but the assembly is where they're actually bringing in -- the country workers are very willing to work. They want to work.
There's a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs.
That condition's going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years if they realize what they want, which is, you know, 400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities.
In this particular case -- this is the assembly line that you saw; this is a shot of it.
I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field.
I had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot.
It took me five fake tries because they were just going. To slow them down was literally impossible.
They were just wound up doing these things all day long, until the manager had to, with a stern voice, say, "Okay, everybody freeze."
It wasn't too bad, but they're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate.
This is a textile mill doing synthetic silk, an oil byproduct.
And what you're seeing here is, again, one of the most state-of-the-art textile mills.
There are 500 of these machines; they're worth about 200,000 dollars each.
So you have about 12 people running this, and they're just inspecting it -- and they're just walking the lines.
The machines are all running, absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are.
And I started getting in further and further into the factories.
And that's a diptych. I do a lot of pairings to try and get the sense of scale in these places.
This is a line where they get the threads and they wind the threads together, pre-going into the textile mills.
Here's something that's far more labor-intensive, which is the making of shoes.
This floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor.
The company itself had about 10,000 employees, and they're doing domestic shoes.
It was very hard to get into the international companies because I had to get permission from companies like Nike and Adidas, and that's very hard to get.
And they don't want to let me in.
But the domestic was much easier to do.
It just gives you a sense of, again -- and that's where, really, the whole migration of jobs started going over to China and making the shoes. Nike was one of the early ones.
It was such a high labor component to it that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market.
This is a high-tech mobile phone: Bird mobile phone, one of the largest mobile makers in China.
I think mobile phone companies are popping up, literally, on a weekly basis, and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones.
This is a textile where they're doing shirts -- Youngor, the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China.
And this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms.
Everything is very efficient.
While setting up this shot, people on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch.
This was one of the biggest factories I've ever seen.
They make coffeemakers here, the biggest coffeemaker and the biggest iron makers -- they make 20 million of them in the world.
There's 21,000 employees. This one factory -- and they had several of them -- is half a kilometer long.
These are just recently shot -- I just came back about a month ago, so you're the first ones to be seeing these, these new factory pictures I've taken.
So it's taken me almost a year to gain access into these places.
The other aspect of what's happening in China is that there's a real need for materials there.
So a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here are being recycled and taken to China by ships.
That's cubed metal. This is armatures, electrical armatures, where they're getting the copper and the high-end steel from electrical motors out, and recycling them.
This is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley.
But this is what happens to most of the computers.
Fifty percent of the world's computers end up in China to be recycled.
It's referred to as "e-waste" there.
And it is a bit of a problem. The way they recycle the boards is that they actually use the coal briquettes, which are used all through China, but they heat up the boards, and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components.
They're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components.
But the toxic smells -- when you come into a town that's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards, you can smell it a good five or 10 kilometers before you get there.
Here's another operation. It's all cottage industries, so it's not big places -- it's all in people's front porches, in their backyards, even in their homes they're burning boards, if there's a concern for somebody coming by -- because it is considered in China to be illegal, doing it, but they can't stop the product from coming in.
This portrait -- I'm not usually known for portraits, but I couldn't resist this one, where she's been through Mao, and she's been through the Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural Revolution, and now she's sitting on her porch with this e-waste beside her. It's quite something.
This is a road where it's been shored up by computer boards in one of the biggest towns where they're recycling.
So that's the photographs that I wanted to show you.
I want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls.
They've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I've been thinking.
One's Megan, the one of the right, and Katja there.
And to me the whole notion -- the things I'm photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress.
And as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it's palpable in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems, I'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect.
And it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world, but it starts to go up -- because I think we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down -- but there's a growing footprint that's happening in Asia, and is growing at a rapid, rapid rate, and so I don't think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy, I think, here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution, because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well.
So part of my thinking, and part of my wishes, is sitting with these thoughts in mind, and thinking about, "How is their life going to be when they want to have children, or when they're ready to get married 20 years from now -- or whatever, 15 years from now?"
And to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking -- in my work, and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes.
Wish one: world-changing. I want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability.
And it is through communications today that I believe that that is not an unreal idea.
Oh, and I went in search -- I wanted to put what I had in mind, hitch it onto something. I didn't want a wish just to start from nowhere.
One of them I'm starting from almost nothing, but the other one, I wanted to find out what's going on that's working right now.
And Worldchanging.com is a fantastic blog, and that blog is now being visited by close to half-a-million people a month.
And it just started about 14 months ago.
And the beauty of what's going on there is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like.
What they're doing there is that they're not -- I think the environmental movement has failed in that it's used the stick too much; it's used the apocalyptic tone too much; it hasn't sold the positive aspects of being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out.
Whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog is about positive movements, about how to change our world in a better way, quickly.
And it's looking at technology, and it's looking at new energy-saving devices, and it's looking at how to rethink and how to re-strategize the movement towards sustainability.
And so for me, one of the things that I thought would be to put some of my work in the service of promoting the Worldchanging.com website.
Some of you might know, he's a TEDster -- Stephen Sagmeister and I are working on some layouts. And this is still in preliminary stages; these aren't the finals. But these images, with Worldchanging.com, can be placed into any kind of media.
They could be posted through the Web; they could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter, or anything of that nature.
So we're looking at this as trying to build out.
And what we ended up discussing was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text, and the text is blasted all over.
What was unusual, according to Stephen, is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image.
And so in this case, because it's about a lot of these images and what they represent, and the kinds of questions they bring up, that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say, "Well, what's Worldchanging.com, with these images, have to do?"
And hopefully inspire people to go to that website.
So Worldchanging.com, and building that blog, and it is a blog, and I'm hoping that it isn't -- I don't see it as the kind of blog where we're all going to follow each other to death.
This one is one that will spoke out, and will go out, and to start reaching. Because right now there's conversations in India, in China, in South America -- there's entries coming from all around the world.
I think there's a chance to have a dialogue, a conversation about sustainability at Worldchanging.com.
And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic.
Wish two is more of the bottom-up, ground-up one that I'm trying to work with.
And this one is: I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition that motivates kids to invest ideas on, and invent ideas on, sustainability.
And one of the things that came out -- Allison, who actually nominated me, said something earlier on in a brainstorming. She said that recycling in Canada had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six.
And you think about it, you know, grade four -- my wife and I, we say age seven is the age of reason, so they're into the age of reason. And they're pre-puberty.
So it's this great window where they actually are -- you can influence them. You know what happens at puberty?
You know, we know that from earlier presentations.
So my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids to start driving home ideas. Let them understand what sustainability is, and that they have a vested interest in it to happen.
And one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize, so I would take 30,000 or 40,000 dollars of the winnings, and the rest is going to be to manage this project, but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands.
But the other thing that I thought would be fantastic was to create these -- call them "prize targets."
And so one could be for the best sustainable idea for an in-school project, the best one for a household project, or it could be the best community project for sustainability.
And I also thought there should be a nice prize for the best artwork for "In My World." And what would happen -- it's a scalable thing. And if we can get people to put in things -- whether it's equipment, like a media lab, or money to make the prize significant enough -- and to open it up to all the schools that are public schools, or schools that are with kids that age, and make it a wide-open competition for them to go after those prizes and to submit them.
And the prize has to be a verifiable thing, so it's not about just ideas.
The art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them, but the actual things have to be verifiable.
In that way, what's happening is that we're motivating a certain age group to start thinking.
And they're going to push that up, from the bottom -- up into, I believe, into the households. And parents will be reacting to it, and trying to help them with the projects.
And I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability in a very positive way, and starts to teach them. They know about recycling now, but they don't really, I think, get sustainability in all the things, and the energy footprint, and how that matters.
And to teach them, to me, would be a fantastic wish, and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into.
And again, in "In My World," the competition -- we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it.
And I like the words, "in my world," because it gives possession of the world to the person who's doing it.
It is my world; it's not someone else's. I want to help it; I want to do something with it. So I think it has a great opportunity to engage the imaginations -- and great ideas, I think, come from kids -- and engage their imagination into a project, and do something for schools.
I think all schools could use extra equipment, extra cash -- it's going to be an incentive for them to do that.
And these are some of the ideas in terms of where we could possibly put in some promotion for "In My World."
And wish three is: Imax film. So I was told I should do one for myself, and I've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something.
And the scale of my work, and the kinds of ideas I'm playing with -- when I first saw an Imax film, I almost immediately thought, "There's a real resonance between what I'm trying to do and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer."
And I think there's a real possibility to reach new audiences if I had a chance.
So I'm looking, really, for a mentor, because I just had my birthday.
I'm 50, and I don't have time to go back to school right now -- I'm too busy. So I need somebody who can put me on a quick catch-up course on how to do something like that, and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this.
That would be fantastic. So those are my three wishes.

I'm a garbage man.
And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man, because I absolutely hate waste.
I hope, within the next 10 minutes, to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life.
And I'd like to start at the very beginning.
Think back when you were just a kid.
How did look at the stuff in your life?
Perhaps it was like these toddler rules: It's my stuff if I saw it first.
The entire pile is my stuff if I'm building something.
The more stuff that's mine, the better.
And of course, it's your stuff if it's broken.
Well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry, it's become pretty clear to me that we don't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults.
And let me tell you why I have that perspective.
Because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people's discarded stuff.
Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff, but it's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world -- well less than one percent.
In fact, the United Nations estimates that there's about 85 billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year -- and that's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream.
And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth, that number well more than doubles.
And of course, the more developed the country, the bigger these mountains.
Now when you see these mountains, most people think of garbage.
We see above-ground mines.
And the reason we see mines is because there's a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place.
And it's becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams.
Because as we've heard all week at TED, the world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff.
And of course, they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted.
And what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day?
It's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals.
And the metals, we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world.
And the plastics, we get from oil, which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract.
And these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we're already starting to see today.
The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff and starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff, particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner.
Most of what's extracted from our end-of-life stuff, if it makes it to a recycler, are the metals.
To put that in perspective -- and I'm using steel as a proxy here for metals, because it's the most common metal -- if your stuff makes it to a recycler, probably over 90 percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose.
Plastics are a whole other story: well less than 10 percent are recovered.
In fact, it's more like five percent.
Most of it's incinerated or landfilled.
Now most people think that's because plastics are a throw-away material, have very little value.
But actually, plastics are several times more valuable than steel.
And there's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel.
So why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material?
Well it's predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another.
They have very different densities.
They have different electrical and magnetic properties.
And they even have different colors.
So it's very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials.
Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range.
They have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties.
And any plastic can be any color, as you probably well know.
So the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don't work for plastics.
Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world -- and sadly to say, particularly from the United States, where we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe -- finds its way to developing countries for low-cost recycling.
People, for as little as a dollar a day, pick through our stuff.
They extract what they can, which is mostly the metals -- circuit boards and so forth -- and they leave behind mostly what they can't recover, which is, again, mostly the plastics.
Or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here.
And they extract the metals by hand.
Now while this may be the low-economic-cost solution, this is certainly not the low-environmental or human health-and-safety solution.
I call this environmental arbitrage.
And it's not fair, it's not safe and it's not sustainable.
Now because the plastics are so plentiful -- and by the way, those other methods don't lead to the recovery of plastics, obviously -- but people do try to recover the plastics.
This is just one example.
This is a photo I took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai, India.
They store the plastics on the roofs.
They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these, and people try very hard to separate the plastics, by color, by shape, by feel, by any technique they can.
And sometimes they'll resort to what's known as the "burn and sniff" technique where they'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic.
None of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way.
And by the way, please don't try this technique at home.
So what are we to do about this space-age material, at least what we used to call a space-aged material, these plastics?
Well I certainly believe that it's far too valuable and far too abundant to keep putting back in the ground or certainly send up in smoke.
So about 20 years ago, I literally started in my garage tinkering around, trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other, and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends, in the mining world actually, and in the plastics world, and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world.
Because after all, we're doing above-ground mining.
And we eventually broke the code.
This is the last frontier of recycling.
It's the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth.
And we finally figured out how to do it.
And in the process, we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics.
The traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals.
You breakdown the molecules, you recombine them in very specific ways, to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day.
We said, there's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics.
And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint, sustainable from an economic standpoint as well.
Well a good place to start is with waste.
It certainly doesn't cost as much as oil, and it's plentiful, as I hope that you've been able to see from the photographs.
And because we're not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them, we're using a mining approach to extract the materials.
We have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment.
We have enormous energy savings.
I don't know how many other projects on the planet right now can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way.
And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life, our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them.
And we make a drop-in replacement for that plastic that's made from petrochemicals.
Our customers get to enjoy huge CO2 savings.
They get to close the loop with their products.
And they get to make more sustainable products.
In the short time period I have, I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this.
It starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits.
They recover the metals and leave behind what's called shredder residue -- it's their waste -- a very complex mixture of materials, but predominantly plastics.
We take out the things that aren't plastics, such as the metals they missed, carpeting, foam, rubber, wood, glass, paper, you name it.
Even an occasional dead animal, unfortunately.
And it goes in the first part of our process here, which is more like traditional recycling.
We're sieving the material, we're using magnets, we're using air classification.
It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point.
At the end of this process, we have a mixed plastic composite: many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics.
This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process, and the really hard work, multi-step separation process begins.
We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail.
We use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics, not only by type, but by grade.
And out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic: one type, one grade.
We then use optical sorting to color sort this material.
We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos.
We push that material to extruders where we melt it, push it through small die holes, make spaghetti-like plastic strands.
And we chop those strands into what are called pellets.
And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry.
This is the same material that you would get from oil.
And today, we're producing it from your old stuff, and it's going right back into your new stuff.
So now, instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke, you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products, in your office, or back at work in your home.
And these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic, replacing virgin plastic, to make their new products.
So I hope I've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life.
We took our clues from mother nature.
Mother nature wastes very little, reuses practically everything.
And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer -- that's a label I've always hated my entire life -- and think of yourself as just using resources in one form, until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time.
And finally, I hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to: "If it's broken, it's my stuff."
Thank you for your time.

<title>Mike Biddle: We can recycle plastic</title>
<description>Less than 10% of plastic trash is recycled -- compared to almost 90% of metals -- because of the massively complicated problem of finding and sorting the different kinds. Frustrated by this waste, Mike Biddle has developed a cheap and incredibly energy efficient plant that can, and does, recycle any kind of plastic. &lt;a href="http://blog.ted.com/2012/10/22/a-better-way-to-recycle-plastics-mike-biddle-replies-to-questions-and-comments-about-his-2011-tedtalk"&gt;Read Mike's responses to questions about this talk.&lt;/a&gt;</description>
<keywords>business,global issues,green,plastic,technology</keywords>
<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/laurie_santos.html</url>
I want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species.
The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious, and that's that our species, Homo sapiens, is actually really, really smart -- like, ridiculously smart -- like you're all doing things that no other species on the planet does right now.
And this is, of course, not the first time you've probably recognized this.
Of course, in addition to being smart, we're also an extremely vain species.
So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart.
You know, so I could turn to pretty much any sage from Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert to point out things like the fact that we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties and just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planet when it comes to all things cerebral.
But of course, there's a second observation about the human species that I want to focus on a little bit more, and that's the fact that even though we're actually really smart, sometimes uniquely smart, we can also be incredibly, incredibly dumb when it comes to some aspects of our decision making.
Now I'm seeing lots of smirks out there.
Don't worry, I'm not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes.
But of course, just in the last two years we see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude.
And we've watched as the tools we uniquely make to pull the resources out of our environment kind of just blow up in our face.
We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create -- these markets that were supposed to be foolproof -- we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes.
But both of these two embarrassing examples, I think, don't highlight what I think is most embarrassing about the mistakes that humans make, which is that we'd like to think that the mistakes we make are really just the result of a couple bad apples or a couple really sort of FAIL Blog-worthy decisions.
But it turns out, what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us, when put in certain contexts, will actually make very specific mistakes.
The errors we make are actually predictable.
We make them again and again.
And they're actually immune to lots of evidence.
When we get negative feedback, we still, the next time we're face with a certain context, tend to make the same errors.
And so this has been a real puzzle to me as a sort of scholar of human nature.
What I'm most curious about is, how is a species that's as smart as we are capable of such bad and such consistent errors all the time?
You know, we're the smartest thing out there, why can't we figure this out?
In some sense, where do our mistakes really come from?
And having thought about this a little bit, I see a couple different possibilities.
One possibility is, in some sense, it's not really our fault.
Because we're a smart species, we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super, super complicated, sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand, even though we've actually created them.
We create financial markets that are super complex.
We create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with.
And of course, if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it, in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up.
If this was the case, we'd have a really easy solution to the problem of human error.
We'd actually just say, okay, let's figure out the kinds of technologies we can't deal with, the kinds of environments that are bad -- get rid of those, design things better, and we should be the noble species that we expect ourselves to be.
But there's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying, which is, maybe it's not our environments that are messed up.
Maybe it's actually us that's designed badly.
This is a hint that I've gotten from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors.
And what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way, over and over again.
It feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways.
This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about, because, if it's us that's messed up, it's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it.
We might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone and try to design things around it.
So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at.
How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two?
What we need is a population that's basically smart, can make lots of decisions, but doesn't have access to any of the systems we have, any of the things that might mess us up -- no human technology, human culture, maybe even not human language.
And so this is why we turned to these guys here.
These are one of the guys I work with. This is a brown capuchin monkey.
These guys are New World primates, which means they broke off from the human branch about 35 million years ago.
This means that your great, great, great great, great, great -- with about five million "greats" in there -- grandmother was probably the same great, great, great, great grandmother with five million "greats" in there as Holly up here.
You know, so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant, but albeit evolutionary, relative.
The good news about Holly though is that she doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do.
You know, she's a smart, very cut creature, a primate as well, but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up.
So she's the perfect test case.
What if we put Holly into the same context as humans?
Does she make the same mistakes as us?
Does she not learn from them? And so on.
And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do.
My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago.
We said, all right, let's, you know, throw so problems at Holly, see if she messes these things up.
First problem is just, well, where should we start?
Because, you know, it's great for us, but bad for humans.
We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts.
You know, where are we actually going to start with this?
And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse, around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news, we said, hhmm, maybe we should actually start in the financial domain.
Maybe we should look at monkey's economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do.
Of course, that's when we hit a sort second problem -- a little bit more methodological -- which is that, maybe you guys don't know, but monkeys don't actually use money. I know, you haven't met them.
But this is why, you know, they're not in the queue behind you at the grocery store or the ATM -- you know, they don't do this stuff.
So now we faced, you know, a little bit of a problem here.
How are we actually going to ask monkeys about money if they don't actually use it?
So we said, well, maybe we should just, actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money.
So that's just what we did.
What you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of of non-human currency.
We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies, so we just called it a token.
But this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at Yale to actually use with humans, to actually buy different pieces of food.
It doesn't look like much -- in fact, it isn't like much.
Like most of our money, it's just a piece of metal.
As those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know, once you get home, it's actually pretty useless.
It was useless to the monkeys at first before they realized what they could do with it.
When we first gave it to them in their enclosures, they actually kind of picked them up, looked at them.
They were these kind of weird things.
But very quickly, the monkeys realized that they could actually hand these tokens over to different humans in the lab for some food.
And so you see one of our monkeys, Mayday, up here doing this.
This is A and B are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bit curious about these things -- doesn't know.
There's this waiting hand from a human experimenter, and Mayday quickly figures out, apparently the human wants this.
Hands it over, and then gets some food.
It turns out not just Mayday, all of our monkeys get good at trading tokens with human salesman.
So here's just a quick video of what this looks like.
Here's Mayday. She's going to be trading a token for some food and waiting happily and getting her food.
Here's Felix, I think. He's our alpha male; he's a kind of big guy.
But he too waits patiently, gets his food and goes on.
So the monkeys get really good at this.
They're surprisingly good at this with very little training.
We just allowed them to pick this up on their own.
The question is: is this anything like human money?
Is this a market at all, or did we just do a weird psychologist's trick by getting monkeys to do something, looking smart, but not really being smart.
And so we said, well, what would the monkeys spontaneously do if this was really their currency, if they were really using it like money?
Well, you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other.
You might have them start paying attention to price, paying attention to how much they buy -- sort of keeping track of their monkey token, as it were.
Do the monkeys do anything like this?
And so our monkey marketplace was born.
The way this works is that our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure.
When they get a hankering for some treats, we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market.
Upon entering the market -- it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets because, as the monkeys entered the door of the market, a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens so they could actually trade the tokens with one of these two guys here -- two different possible human salesmen that they could actually buy stuff from.
The salesmen were students from my lab.
They dressed differently; they were different people.
And over time, they did basically the same thing so the monkeys could learn, you know, who sold what at what price -- you know, who was reliable, who wasn't, and so on.
And you can see that each of the experimenters is actually holding up a little, yellow food dish.
and that's what the monkey can for a single token.
So everything costs one token, but as you can see, sometimes tokens buy more than others, sometimes more grapes than others.
So I'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like.
Here's a monkey-eye-view. Monkeys are shorter, so it's a little short.
But here's Honey.
She's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently.
All of a sudden the market opens. Here's her choice: one grapes or two grapes.
You can see Honey, very good market economist, goes with the guy who gives more.
She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two.
So not just Honey, most of the monkeys went with guys who had more.
Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food.
When we introduced sales, we saw the monkeys paid attention to that.
They really cared about their monkey token dollar.
The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists to actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools, they basically matched, not just qualitatively, but quantitatively with what we saw humans doing in a real market.
So much so that, if you saw the monkeys' numbers, you couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market.
And what we'd really thought we'd done is like we'd actually introduced something that, at least for the monkeys and us, works like a real financial currency.
Question is: do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do?
Well, we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might.
One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace was any evidence of saving -- you know, just like our own species.
The monkeys entered the market, spent their entire budget and then went back to everyone else.
The other thing we also spontaneously saw, embarrassingly enough, is spontaneous evidence of larceny.
The monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity -- from each other, often from us -- you know, things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing, but things we spontaneously saw.
So we said, this looks bad.
Can we actually see if the monkeys are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do?
One possibility is just kind of let the monkey financial system play out, you know, see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years.
We were a little impatient so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit.
So we said, let's actually give the monkeys the same kinds of problems that humans tend to get wrong in certain kinds of economic challenges, or certain kinds of economic experiments.
And so, since the best way to see how people go wrong is to actually do it yourself, I'm going to give you guys a quick experiment to sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action.
So imagine that right now I handed each and every one of you a thousand U.S. dollars -- so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills.
Take these, put it in your wallet and spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it.
Because it's yours now; you can buy whatever you want.
Donate it, take it, and so on.
Sounds great, but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money.
And here's your choice: you can either be risky, in which case I'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens.
If it comes up heads, you're going to get a thousand dollars more.
If it comes up tails, you get nothing.
So it's a chance to get more, but it's pretty risky.
Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure.
I'm just going to give you 500 bucks.
You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately.
So see what your intuition is here.
Most people actually go with the play-it-safe option.
Most people say, why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure?
This seems like a good bet. I'm going to go with that.
You might say, eh, that's not really irrational.
People are a little risk-averse. So what?
Well, the "so what?" comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently.
So now imagine that I give each and every one of you 2,000 dollars -- 20 crisp hundred dollar bills.
Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before.
Think about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet.
And now imagine that I have you make another choice But this time, it's a little bit worse.
Now, you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money, but you're going to get the same choice.
You can either take a risky loss -- so I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you're going to actually lose a lot.
If it comes up tails, you lose nothing, you're fine, get to keep the whole thing -- or you could play it safe, which means you have to reach back into your wallet and give me five of those $100 bills, for certain.
And I'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there.
So maybe you're having the same intuitions as the subjects that were actually tested in this, which is when presented with these options, people don't choose to play it safe.
They actually tend to go a little risky.
The reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situations the same choice.
It's a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000, or just 1,500 dollars with certainty.
But people's intuitions about how much risk to take varies depending on where they started with.
So what's going on?
Well, it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level.
One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms.
You really have to do work to figure out, well, one option's a thousand, 2,000; one is 1,500.
Instead, we find it very easy to think in very relative terms as options change from one time to another.
So we think of things as, "Oh, I'm going to get more," or "Oh, I'm going to get less."
This is all well and good, except that changes in different directions actually effect whether or not we think options are good or not.
And this leads to the second bias, which economists have called loss aversion.
The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red.
We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money.
And this means that sometimes we'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this.
What you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss.
That means when we're in a risk mindset -- excuse me, when we're in a loss mindset, we actually become more risky, which can actually be really worrying.
These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans.
They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer -- because they're evaluating them in relative terms.
They're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house -- because they don't want to sell at a loss.
The question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases.
If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market, would they do the same thing as people?
And so this is what we did, we gave the monkeys choices between guys who were safe -- they did the same thing every time -- or guys who were risky -- they did things differently half the time.
And then we gave them options that were bonuses -- like you guys did in the first scenario -- so they actually have a chance more, or pieces where they were experiencing losses -- they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got.
And so this is what this looks like.
We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen.
The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape, so it looks pretty good.
But they're going to give the monkeys bonuses.
The guy on the left is a safe bonus.
All the time, he adds one, to give the monkeys two.
The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus.
Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero.
Sometimes the monkeys get two extra.
For a big bonus, now they get three.
But this is the same choice you guys just faced.
Do the monkeys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial, or do they want to be risky and try to get a risky, but big, bonus, but risk the possibility of getting no bonus.
People here played it safe.
Turns out, the monkeys play it safe too.
Qualitatively and quantitatively, they choose exactly the same way as people, when tested in the same thing.
You might say, well, maybe the monkeys just don't like risk.
Maybe we should see how they do with losses.
And so we ran a second version of this.
Now, the monkeys meet two guys who aren't giving them bonuses; they're actually giving them less than they expect.
So they look like they're starting out with a big amount.
These are three grapes; the monkey's really psyched for this.
But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect.
They guy on the left is a safe loss.
Every single time, he's going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two.
the guy on the right is the risky loss.
Sometimes he gives no loss, so the monkeys are really psyched, but sometimes he actually gives a big loss, taking away two to give the monkeys only one.
And so what do the monkeys do?
Again, same choice; they can play it safe for always getting two grapes every single time, or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three.
The remarkable thing to us is that, when you give monkeys this choice, they do the same irrational thing that people do.
They actually become more risky depending on how the experimenters started.
This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too are evaluating things in relative terms and actually treating losses differently than they treat gains.
So what does all of this mean?
Well, what we've shown is that, first of all, we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency, and they do very similar things with it.
They do some of the smart things we do, some of the kind of not so nice things we do, like steal it and so on.
But they also do some of the irrational things we do.
They systematically get things wrong and in the same ways that we do.
This is the first take-home message of the Talk, which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought, oh, I'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser.
They're way cuter than the one at ... you know -- Don't do that; they're probably going to be just as dumb as the human one you already have.
So, you know, a little bad -- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
A little bad for monkey investors.
But of course, you know, the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too.
Because we've answered the question we started out with.
We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from.
And we started with the hope that maybe we can sort of tweak our financial institutions, tweak our technologies to make ourselves better.
But what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that.
In fact, they might be due to the very nature of our evolutionary history.
You know, maybe it's not just humans at the right side of this chain that's duncey.
Maybe it's sort of duncey all the way back.
And this, if we believe the capuchin monkey results, means that these duncey strategies might be 35 million years old.
That's a long time for a strategy to potentially get changed around -- really, really old.
What do we know about other old strategies like this?
Well, one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome.
You know, think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things, fatty things like cheesecake.
You can't just shut that off.
You can't just look at the dessert cart as say, "No, no, no. That looks disgusting to me."
We're just built differently.
We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after.
My guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving different financial decisions.
When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red, when you're watching your house price go down, you're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms.
This means that the biases that lead investors to do badly, that lead to the foreclosure crisis are going to be really hard to overcome.
So that's the bad news. The question is: is there any good news?
I'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news.
Well, the good news, I think, is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk, which is that humans are not only smart; we're really inspirationally smart to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom.
We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations -- you know, I flew over here in an airplane.
I didn't have to try to flap my wings.
I'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you.
I don't have to rely on my own near-sightedness.
We actually have all of these cases where we overcome our biological limitations through technology and other means, seemingly pretty easily.
But we have to recognize that we have those limitations.
And here's the rub.
It was Camus who once said that, "Man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is."
But the irony is that it might only be in recognizing our limitations that we can really actually overcome them.
The hope is that you all will think about your limitations, not necessarily as unovercomable, but to recognize them, accept them and then use the world of design to actually figure them out.
That might be the only way that we will really be able to achieve our own human potential and really be the noble species we hope to all be.
Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_green_why_we_should_build_wooden_skyscrapers.html</url>
This is my grandfather.
And this is my son.
My grandfather taught me to work with wood when I was a little boy, and he also taught me the idea that if you cut down a tree to turn it into something, honor that tree's life and make it as beautiful as you possibly can.
My little boy reminded me that for all the technology and all the toys in the world, sometimes just a small block of wood, if you stack it up tall, actually is an incredibly inspiring thing.
These are my buildings.
I build all around the world out of our office in Vancouver and New York.
And we build buildings of different sizes and styles and different materials, depending on where we are.
But wood is the material that I love the most, and I'm going to tell you the story about wood.
And part of the reason I love it is that every time people go into my buildings that are wood, I notice they react completely differently.
I've never seen anybody walk into one of my buildings and hug a steel or a concrete column, but I've actually seen that happen in a wood building.
I've actually seen how people touch the wood, and I think there's a reason for it.
Just like snowflakes, no two pieces of wood can ever be the same anywhere on Earth.
That's a wonderful thing.
I like to think that wood gives Mother Nature fingerprints in our buildings.
It's Mother Nature's fingerprints that make our buildings connect us to nature in the built environment.
Now, I live in Vancouver, near a forest that grows to 33 stories tall.
Down the coast here in California, the redwood forest grows to 40 stories tall.
But the buildings that we think about in wood are only four stories tall in most places on Earth.
Even building codes actually limit the ability for us to build much taller than four stories in many places, and that's true here in the United States.
Now there are exceptions, but there needs to be some exceptions, and things are going to change, I'm hoping.
And the reason I think that way is that today half of us live in cities, and that number is going to grow to 75 percent.
Cities and density mean that our buildings are going to continue to be big, and I think there's a role for wood to play in cities.
And I feel that way because three billion people in the world today, over the next 20 years, will need a new home.
That's 40 percent of the world that are going to need a new building built for them in the next 20 years.
Now, one in three people living in cities today actually live in a slum.
That's one billion people in the world live in slums.
A hundred million people in the world are homeless.
The scale of the challenge for architects and for society to deal with in building is to find a solution to house these people.
But the challenge is, as we move to cities, cities are built in these two materials, steel and concrete, and they're great materials.
They're the materials of the last century.
But they're also materials with very high energy and very high greenhouse gas emissions in their process.
Steel represents about three percent of man's greenhouse gas emissions, and concrete is over five percent.
So if you think about that, eight percent of our contribution to greenhouse gases today comes from those two materials alone.
We don't think about it a lot, and unfortunately, we actually don't even think about buildings, I think, as much as we should.
This is a U.S. statistic about the impact of greenhouse gases.
Almost half of our greenhouse gases are related to the building industry, and if we look at energy, it's the same story.
You'll notice that transportation's sort of second down that list, but that's the conversation we mostly hear about.
And although a lot of that is about energy, it's also so much about carbon.
The problem I see is that, ultimately, the clash of how we solve that problem of serving those three billion people that need a home, and climate change, are a head-on collision about to happen, or already happening.
That challenge means that we have to start thinking in new ways, and I think wood is going to be part of that solution, and I'm going to tell you the story of why.
As an architect, wood is the only material, big material, that I can build with that's already grown by the power of the sun.
When a tree grows in the forest and gives off oxygen and soaks up carbon dioxide, and it dies and it falls to the forest floor, it gives that carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere or into the ground.
If it burns in a forest fire, it's going to give that carbon back to the atmosphere as well.
But if you take that wood and you put it into a building or into a piece of furniture or into that wooden toy, it actually has an amazing capacity to store the carbon and provide us with a sequestration.
One cubic meter of wood will store one tonne of carbon dioxide.
Now our two solutions to climate are obviously to reduce our emissions and find storage.
Wood is the only major material building material I can build with that actually does both those two things.
So I believe that we have an ethic that the Earth grows our food, and we need to move to an ethic in this century that the Earth should grow our homes.
Now, how are we going to do that when we're urbanizing at this rate and we think about wood buildings only at four stories?
We need to reduce the concrete and steel and we need to grow bigger, and what we've been working on is 30-story tall buildings made of wood.
We've been engineering them with an engineer named Eric Karsh who works with me on it, and we've been doing this new work because there are new wood products out there for us to use, and we call them mass timber panels.
These are panels made with young trees, small growth trees, small pieces of wood glued together to make panels that are enormous: eight feet wide, 64 feet long, and of various thicknesses.
The way I describe this best, I've found, is to say that we're all used to two-by-four construction when we think about wood.
That's what people jump to as a conclusion.
Two-by-four construction is sort of like the little eight-dot bricks of Lego that we all played with as kids, and you can make all kinds of cool things out of Lego at that size, and out of two-by-fours.
But do remember when you were a kid, and you kind of sifted through the pile in your basement, and you found that big 24-dot brick of Lego, and you were kind of like, "Cool, this is awesome. I can build something really big, and this is going to be great."
That's the change.
Mass timber panels are those 24-dot bricks.
They're changing the scale of what we can do, and what we've developed is something we call FFTT, which is a Creative Commons solution to building a very flexible system of building with these large panels where we tilt up six stories at a time if we want to.
This animation shows you how the building goes together in a very simple way, but these buildings are available for architects and engineers now to build on for different cultures in the world, different architectural styles and characters.
In order for us to build safely, we've engineered these buildings, actually, to work in a Vancouver context, where we're a high seismic zone, even at 30 stories tall.
Now obviously, every time I bring this up, people even, you know, here at the conference, say, "Are you serious? Thirty stories? How's that going to happen?"
And there's a lot of really good questions that are asked and important questions that we spent quite a long time working on the answers to as we put together our report and the peer reviewed report.
I'm just going to focus on a few of them, and let's start with fire, because I think fire is probably the first one that you're all thinking about right now.
Fair enough.
And the way I describe it is this.
If I asked you to take a match and light it and hold up a log and try to get that log to go on fire, it doesn't happen, right? We all know that.
But to build a fire, you kind of start with small pieces of wood and you work your way up, and eventually you can add the log to the fire, it burns, but it burns slowly.
Well, mass timber panels, these new products that we're using, are much like the log.
It's hard to start them on fire, and when they do, they actually burn extraordinarily predictably, and we can use fire science in order to predict and make these buildings as safe as concrete and as safe as steel.
The next big issue, deforestation.
Eighteen percent of our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide is the result of deforestation.
The last thing we want to do is cut down trees.
Or, the last thing we want to do is cut down the wrong trees.
There are models for sustainable forestry that allow us to cut trees properly, and those are the only trees appropriate to use for these kinds of systems.
Now I actually think that these ideas will change the economics of deforestation.
In countries with deforestation issues, we need to find a way to provide better value for the forest and actually encourage people to make money through very fast growth cycles -- 10-, 12-, 15-year-old trees that make these products and allow us to build at this scale.
We've calculated a 20-story building: We'll grow enough wood in North America every 13 minutes.
That's how much it takes.
The carbon story here is a really good one.
If we built a 20-story building out of cement and concrete, the process would result in the manufacturing of that cement and 1,200 tonnes of carbon dioxide.
If we did it in wood, in this solution, we'd sequester about 3,100 tonnes, for a net difference of 4,300 tonnes.
That's the equivalent of about 900 cars removed from the road in one year.
Think back to that three billion people that need a new home, and maybe this is a contributor to reducing.
We're at the beginning of a revolution, I hope, in the way we build, because this is the first new way to build a skyscraper in probably 100 years or more.
But the challenge is changing society's perception of possibility, and it's a huge challenge.
The engineering is, truthfully, the easy part of this.
And the way I describe it is this.
The first skyscraper, technically -- and the definition of a skyscraper is 10 stories tall, believe it or not — but the first skyscraper was this one in Chicago, and people were terrified to walk underneath this building.
But only four years after it was built, Gustave Eiffel was building the Eiffel Tower, and as he built the Eiffel Tower, he changed the skylines of the cities of the world, changed and created a competition between places like New York City and Chicago, where developers started building bigger and bigger buildings and pushing the envelope up higher and higher with better and better engineering.
We built this model in New York, actually, as a theoretical model on the campus of a technical university soon to come, and the reason we picked this site to just show you what these buildings may look like, because the exterior can change.
It's really just the structure that we're talking about.
The reason we picked it is because this is a technical university, and I believe that wood is the most technologically advanced material I can build with.
It just happens to be that Mother Nature holds the patent, and we don't really feel comfortable with it.
But that's the way it should be, nature's fingerprints in the built environment.
I'm looking for this opportunity to create an Eiffel Tower moment, we call it.
Buildings are starting to go up around the world.
There's a building in London that's nine stories, a new building that just finished in Australia that I believe is 10 or 11.
We're starting to push the height up of these wood buildings, and we're hoping, and I'm hoping, that my hometown of Vancouver actually potentially announces the world's tallest at around 20 stories in the not-so-distant future.
That Eiffel Tower moment will break the ceiling, these arbitrary ceilings of height, and allow wood buildings to join the competition.
And I believe the race is ultimately on.
Thank you.

So when the White House was built in the early 19th century, it was an open house.
Neighbors came and went. Under President Adams, a local dentist happened by.
He wanted to shake the President's hand.
The President dismissed the Secretary of State, whom he was conferring with, and asked the dentist if he would remove a tooth.
Later, in the 1850s, under President Pierce, he was known to have remarked — probably the only thing he's known for — when a neighbor passed by and said, "I'd love to see the beautiful house," and Pierce said to him, "Why my dear sir, of course you may come in.
This isn't my house. It is the people's house."
Well, when I got to the White House in the beginning of 2009, at the start of the Obama Administration, the White House was anything but open.
Bomb blast curtains covered my windows.
We were running Windows 2000.
Social media were blocked at the firewall.
We didn't have a blog, let alone a dozen twitter accounts like we have today.
I came in to become the head of Open Government, to take the values and the practices of transparency, participation and collaboration, and instill them into the way that we work, to open up government, to work with people.
Now one of the things that we know is that companies are very good at getting people to work together in teams and in networks to make very complex products, like cars and computers, and the more complex the products are a society creates, the more successful the society is over time.
Companies make goods, but governments, they make public goods. They work on the cure for cancer and educating our children and making roads, but we don't have institutions that are particularly good at this kind of complexity. We don't have institutions that are good at bringing our talents to bear, at working with us in this kind of open and collaborative way.
So when we wanted to create our Open Government policy, what did we do? We wanted, naturally, to ask public sector employees how we should open up government.
Turns out that had never been done before.
We wanted to ask members of the public to help us come up with a policy, not after the fact, commenting on a rule after it's written, the way is typically the case, but in advance. There was no legal precedent, no cultural precedent, no technical way of doing this.
In fact, many people told us it was illegal.
Here's the crux of the obstacle.
Governments exist to channel the flow of two things, really, values and expertise to and from government and to and from citizens to the end of making decisions.
But the way that our institutions are designed, in our rather 18th-century, centralized model, is to channel the flow of values through voting, once every four years, once every two years, at best, once a year. This is a rather anemic and thin way, in this era of social media, for us to actually express our values.
Today we have technology that lets us express ourselves a great deal, perhaps a little too much.
Then in the 19th century, we layer on the concept of bureaucracy and the administrative state to help us govern complex and large societies.
But we've centralized these bureaucracies.
We've entrenched them. And we know that the smartest person always works for someone else.
We need to only look around this room to know that expertise and intelligence is widely distributed in society, and not limited simply to our institutions.
Scientists have been studying in recent years the phenomenon that they often describe as flow, that the design of our systems, whether natural or social, channel the flow of whatever runs through them.
So a river is designed to channel the flow of water, and the lightning bolt that comes out of a cloud channels the flow of electricity, and a leaf is designed to channel the flow of nutrients to the tree, sometimes even having to route around an obstacle, but to get that nutrition flowing.
The same can be said for our social systems, for our systems of government, where, at the very least, flow offers us a helpful metaphor for understanding what the problem is, what's really broken, and the urgent need that we have, that we all feel today, to redesign the flow of our institutions.
We live in a Cambrian era of big data, of social networks, and we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions that are actually quite recent.
Think about it: What other business do you know, what other sector of the economy, and especially one as big as the public sector, that doesn't seek to reinvent its business model on a regular basis?
Sure, we invest plenty in innovation. We invest in broadband and science education and science grants, but we invest far too little in reinventing and redesigning the institutions that we have.
Now, it's very easy to complain, of course, about partisan politics and entrenched bureaucracy, and we love to complain about government. It's a perennial pastime, especially around election time, but the world is complex. We soon will have 10 billion people, many of whom will lack basic resources.
So complain as we might, what actually can replace what we have today?
What comes the day after the Arab Spring?
Well, one attractive alternative that obviously presents itself to us is that of networks. Right? Networks like Facebook and Twitter. They're lean. They're mean.
You've got 3,000 employees at Facebook governing 900 million inhabitants.
We might even call them citizens, because they've recently risen up to fight against legislative incursion, and the citizens of these networks work together to serve each other in great ways.
But private communities, private, corporate, privatizing communities, are not bottom-up democracies.
They cannot replace government.
Friending someone on Facebook is not complex enough to do the hard work of you and I collaborating with each other and doing the hard work of governance.
But social media do teach us something.
Why is Twitter so successful? Because it opens up its platform.
It opens up the API to allow hundreds of thousands of new applications to be built on top of it, so that we can read and process information in new and exciting ways.
We need to think about how to open up the API of government, and the way that we're going to do that, the next great superpower is going to be the one who can successfully combine the hierarchy of institution -- because we have to maintain those public values, we have to coordinate the flow -- but with the diversity and the pulsating life and the chaos and the excitement of networks, all of us working together to build these new innovations on top of our institutions, to engage in the practice of governance.
We have a precedent for this. Good old Henry II here, in the 12th century, invented the jury.
Powerful, practical, palpable model for handing power from government to citizens.
Today we have the opportunity, and we have the imperative, to create thousands of new ways of interconnecting between networks and institutions, thousands of new kinds of juries: the citizen jury, the Carrotmob, the hackathon, we are just beginning to invent the models by which we can cocreate the process of governance.
Now, we don't fully have a picture of what this will look like yet, but we're seeing pockets of evolution emerging all around us -- maybe not even evolution, I'd even start to call it a revolution -- in the way that we govern.
Some of it's very high-tech, and some of it is extremely low-tech, such as the project that MKSS is running in Rajasthan, India, where they take the spending data of the state and paint it on 100,000 village walls, and then invite the villagers to come and comment who is on the government payroll, who's actually died, what are the bridges that have been built to nowhere, and to work together through civic engagement to save real money and participate and have access to that budget.
But it's not just about policing government.
It's also about creating government.
Spacehive in the U.K. is engaging in crowd-funding, getting you and me to raise the money to build the goalposts and the park benches that will actually allow us to deliver better services in our communities.
No one is better at this activity of actually getting us to engage in delivering services, sometimes where none exist, than Ushahidi.
Created after the post-election riots in Kenya in 2008, this crisis-mapping website and community is actually able to crowdsource and target the delivery of better rescue services to people trapped under the rubble, whether it's after the earthquakes in Haiti, or more recently in Italy.
And the Red Cross too is training volunteers and Twitter is certifying them, not simply to supplement existing government institutions, but in many cases, to replace them.
Now what we're seeing lots of examples of, obviously, is the opening up of government data, not enough examples of this yet, but we're starting to see this practice of people creating and generating innovative applications on top of government data.
There's so many examples I could have picked, and I selected this one of Jon Bon Jovi. Some of you may or may not know that he runs a soup kitchen in New Jersey, where he caters to and serves the homeless and particularly homeless veterans.
In February, he approached the White House, and said, "I would like to fund a prize to create scalable national applications, apps, that will help not only the homeless but those who deliver services [to] them to do so better."
February 2012 to June of 2012, the finalists are announced in the competition.
Can you imagine, in the bureaucratic world of yesteryear, getting anything done in a four-month period of time?
You can barely fill out the forms in that amount of time, let alone generate real, palpable innovations that improve people's lives.
And I want to be clear to mention that this open government revolution is not about privatizing government, because in many cases what it can do when we have the will to do so is to deliver more progressive and better policy than the regulations and the legislative and litigation-oriented strategies by which we make policy today.
In the State of Texas, they regulate 515 professions, from well-driller to florist.
Now, you can carry a gun into a church in Dallas, but do not make a flower arrangement without a license, because that will land you in jail.
So what is Texas doing? They're asking you and me, using online policy wikis, to help not simply get rid of burdensome regulations that impede entrepreneurship, but to replace those regulations with more innovative alternatives, sometimes using transparency in the creation of new iPhone apps that will allows us both to protect consumers and the public and to encourage economic development.
That is a nice sideline of open government.
It's not only the benefits that we've talked about with regard to development. It's the economic benefits and the job creation that's coming from this open innovation work.
Sberbank, the largest and oldest bank in Russia, largely owned by the Russian government, has started practicing crowdsourcing, engaging its employees and citizens in the public in developing innovations.
Last year they saved a billion dollars, 30 billion rubles, from open innovation, and they're pushing radically the extension of crowdsourcing, not only from banking, but into the public sector.
And we see lots of examples of these innovators using open government data, not simply to make apps, but then to make companies and to hire people to build them working with the government.
So a lot of these innovations are local.
In San Ramon, California, they published an iPhone app in which they allow you or me to say we are certified CPR-trained, and then when someone has a heart attack, a notification goes out so that you can rush over to the person over here and deliver CPR.
The victim who receives bystander CPR is more than twice as likely to survive.
"There is a hero in all of us," is their slogan.
But it's not limited to the local.
British Columbia, Canada, is publishing a catalogue of all the ways that its residents and citizens can engage with the state in the cocreation of governance.
Let me be very clear, and perhaps controversial, that open government is not about transparent government.
Simply throwing data over the transom doesn't change how government works.
It doesn't get anybody to do anything with that data to change lives, to solve problems, and it doesn't change government.
What it does is it creates an adversarial relationship between civil society and government over the control and ownership of information.
And transparency, by itself, is not reducing the flow of money into politics, and arguably, it's not even producing accountability as well as it might if we took the next step of combining participation and collaboration with transparency to transform how we work.
We're going to see this evolution really in two phases, I think. The first phase of the open government revolution is delivering better information from the crowd into the center.
Starting in 2005, and this is how this open government work in the U.S. really got started, I was teaching a patent law class to my students and explaining to them how a single person in the bureaucracy has the power to make a decision about which patent application becomes the next patent, and therefore monopolizes for 20 years the rights over an entire field of inventive activity.
Well, what did we do? We said, we can make a website, we can make an expert network, a social network, that would connect the network to the institution to allow scientists and technologists to get better information to the patent office to aid in making those decisions.
We piloted the work in the U.S. and the U.K. and Japan and Australia, and now I'm pleased to report that the United States Patent Office will be rolling out universal, complete, and total openness, so that all patent applications will now be open for citizen participation, beginning this year.
The second phase of this evolution — Yeah.
They deserve a hand.
The first phase is in getting better information in.
The second phase is in getting decision-making power out.
Participatory budgeting has long been practiced in Porto Alegre, Brazil.
They're just starting it in the 49th Ward in Chicago.
Russia is using wikis to get citizens writing law together, as is Lithuania. When we start to see power over the core functions of government — spending, legislation, decision-making — then we're well on our way to an open government revolution.
There are many things that we can do to get us there.
Obviously opening up the data is one, but the important thing is to create lots more -- create and curate -- lots more participatory opportunities.
Hackathons and mashathons and working with data to build apps is an intelligible way for people to engage and participate, like the jury is, but we're going to need lots more things like it.
And that's why we need to start with our youngest people.
We've heard talk here at TED about people biohacking and hacking their plants with Arduino, and Mozilla is doing work around the world in getting young people to build websites and make videos.
When we start by teaching young people that we live, not in a passive society, a read-only society, but in a writable society, where we have the power to change our communities, to change our institutions, that's when we begin to really put ourselves on the pathway towards this open government innovation, towards this open government movement, towards this open government revolution.
So let me close by saying that I think the important thing for us to do is to talk about and demand this revolution.
We don't have words, really, to describe it yet.
Words like equality and fairness and the traditional elections, democracy, these are not really great terms yet.
They're not fun enough. They're not exciting enough to get us engaged in this tremendous opportunity that awaits us. But I would argue that if we want to see the kinds of innovations, the hopeful and exciting innovations that we hear talked about here at TED, in clean energy, in clean education, in development, if we want to see those adopted and we want to see those scaled, we want to see them become the governance of tomorrow, then we must all participate, then we must get involved.
We must open up our institutions, and like the leaf, we must let the nutrients flow throughout our body politic, throughout our culture, to create open institutions to create a stronger democracy, a better tomorrow.
Thank you.

Compassion: what does it look like?
Come with me to 915 South Bloodworth Street in Raleigh, North Carolina, where I grew up.
If you come in you will see us: evening time, at table -- set for ten but not always all seats filled -- at the point when dinner is ready to be served.
Since mom had eight kids, sometimes she said she couldn't tell who was who and where they were.
Before we could eat, she would ask, "Are all the children in?"
And if someone happened to be missing, we would have to, we say, "Fix a plate" for that person, put it in the oven, then we could say grace, and we could eat.
Also, while we were at the table, there was a ritual in our family: when something significant had happened for any one of us -- whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA, or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination, or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent -- the ritual at the family was, once the announcement is made, we must take five, ten minutes to do what we call "make over" that person -- that is, to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way.
For when one is honored, all are honored.
Also, we had to make a report on our extended "visited" members, that is, extended members of the family, sick and elderly, shut in.
My task was, at least once a week, to visit Mother Lassiter who lived on East Street, Mother Williamson who lived on Bledsoe Avenue, and Mother Lathers who lived on Oberlin Road.
Why? Because they were old and infirm, and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything.
For mom said, "To be family, is to care and share and to look out for one another.
They are our family."
And, of course, sometimes there was a bonus for going.
They would offer sweets or money.
Mom says, "If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them, you must always say, 'Nothing.' And if they insist, say, 'Whatever you mind to give me.'" This was the nature of being at that table.
In fact, she indicated that if we would do that, not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family, but she said, "Even God will smile, and when God smiles, there is peace, and justice, and joy."
So, at the table at 915, I learned something about compassion.
Of course, it was a minister's family, so we had to add God into it.
And so, I came to think that mama eternal, mama eternal, is always wondering: Are all the children in?
And if we had been faithful in caring and sharing, we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world.
Now, it was not always wonderful at that table.
Let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion.
It was Christmas, and at our family, oh, what a morning.
Christmas morning, where we open up our gifts, where we have special prayers, and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols. It was a very intimate moment.
In fact, you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing, and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed, except that daddy messed it up.
There was a member of his staff who did not have any place on that particular Christmas to celebrate.
And daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration.
We thought he must be out of his mind.
This is our time. This is intimate time.
This is when we can just be who we are, and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on, while we are still in our PJs.
Why would daddy bring Elder Revels?
Any other time, but not to the Christmas celebration.
And mom overheard us and said, "Well, you know what? If you really understand the nature of this celebration, it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love.
That's what the celebration is all about.
It's time to make space, to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community."
So, we sucked up.
But growing up at 915, compassion was not a word to be debated; it was a sensibility to how we are together.
We are sisters and brothers united together.
And, like Chief Seattle said, "We did not spin the web of life.
We're all strands in it.
And whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves."
Now that's compassion.
So, let me tell you, I kind of look at the world this way.
I see pictures, and something says, "Now, that's compassion."
A harvested field of grain, with some grain in the corners, reminding me of the Hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest, but you must always leave some on the edges, just in case there's someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture.
Talk about a picture of compassion.
I see -- always, it stirs my heart -- a picture of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
walking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel and maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled, walking across the bridge and going into Selma.
Just a photograph.
Arm in arm for struggle.
Suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of a sense of unity of being.
So, there's another picture. Here, this one. I really do like this picture.
When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated, that day, everybody in my community was upset.
You heard about riots all across the land.
Bobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis.
This is the picture. They said, "It's going to be too volatile for you to go."
He insisted, "I must go."
So, sitting on a flatbed truck, the elders of the community are there, and Bobby stands up and says to the people, "I have bad news for you.
Some of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated.
I know that you are angry, and I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge. But," he said, "what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel.
Because I had someone dear to me snatched away.
I know how you feel."
And he said, "I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did.
I allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while, and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world, and we can do that together."
That's a picture. Compassion? I think I see it.
I saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor, and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world.
He asked them to give a message, and they each read in their own language a central affirmation, and that was some version of the golden rule: "As you would that others would do unto you, do also unto them."
Twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message.
We are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself.
One more picture while I'm stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church: 9/11. Last night at Chagrin Fall, a newspaperman and a television guy said, "That evening, when a service was held at the Riverside Church, we carried it on our station in this city.
It was," he said, "one of the most powerful moments of life together.
We were all suffering.
But you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come, and you invited them.
'Find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated, when we have been despised and rejected.' And they all spoke out of their own traditions, a word about the healing power of solidarity, one with the other."
I developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature, but I became a preacher.
Now, as a preacher, I got a job. I got to preach the stuff, but I got to do it too.
Or, as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks, "Some people preach the Gospel.
I have to tangibilitate the Gospel."
So, the real issue is: How do you tangibilitate compassion?
How do you make it real?
My faith has constantly lifted up the ideal, and challenged me when I fell beneath it.
In my tradition, there is a gift that we have made to other traditions -- to everybody around the world who knows the story of the "Good Samaritan."
Many people think of it primarily in terms of charity, random acts of kindness.
But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly, you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable.
The question was: "What is the greatest commandment?"
And, according to Jesus, the word comes forth, "You must love yourself, you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul, and your neighbor as yourself."
And then the person asked, "Well, what do you mean, 'neighbor?'" And he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves, and how religious authorities went the other way, and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way; but an unsuspecting, despised person came along, saw the man in need, provided oil and wine for his wounds, put him on his own transportation, and took him to the inn and asked the innkeeper, "Take care of him."
And he said, "Here, this is the initial investment, but if needs continue, make sure that you provide them.
And whatever else is needed, I will provide it and pay for it when I return."
This always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan.
A Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and charity, but one who provides a system of sustained care -- I like that, 'a system of sustained care ' -- in the inn, take care.
I think maybe it's one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary -- that all God's children would have their needs cared for, so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks, "In regards to health, are all the children in?" And we could say yes.
Oh, what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion.
I recall that my work as a pastor has always involved caring for their spiritual needs; being concerned for housing, for healthcare, for the prisoners, for the infirm, for children -- even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off, where they are going.
To be a pastor is to care for these individual needs.
But now, to be a Good Samaritan -- and I always say, and to be a good American -- for me, is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care.
Compassion takes on a corporate dynamic.
I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family, that family together that understands the nature of our unity.
We are one people together.
So, let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion, and why I think it is so important that right at this point in history.
We would decide to establish this charter of compassion.
The reason it's important is because this is a very special time in history.
It is the time that, biblically, we would speak of as the day, or the year, of God's favor.
This is a season of grace.
Unusual things are beginning to happen.
Please pardon me, as a black man, for celebrating that the election of Obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor.
And yet, there is so much more that needs to be done.
We need to bring health and food and education and respect for all God's citizens, all God's children, remembering mama eternal.
Now, let me close my comments by telling you that whenever I feel something very deeply, it usually takes the form of verse.
And so I want to close with a little song.
I close with this song -- it's a children's song -- because we are all children at the table of mama eternal.
And if mama eternal has taught us correctly, this song will make sense, not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering, but to all who sign the charter for compassion.
And this is why we do it.
The song says, "I made heaven so happy today, Receiving God's love and giving it away When I looked up, heaven smiled at me Now, I'm so happy. Can't you see? I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? Sharing makes me happy, makes heaven happy too I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? Let me share my happy loving smile with you. That's compassion.

We conventionally divide space into private and public realms, and we know these legal distinctions very well because we've become experts at protecting our private property and private space.
But we're less attuned to the nuances of the public.
What translates generic public space into qualitative space?
I mean, this is something that our studio has been working on for the past decade.
And we're doing this through some case studies.
A large chunk of our work has been put into transforming this neglected industrial ruin into a viable post-industrial space that looks forward and backward And another huge chunk of our work has gone into making relevant a site that's grown out of sync with its time.
We've been working on democratizing Lincoln Center for a public that doesn't usually have $300 to spend on an opera ticket.
So we've been eating, drinking, thinking, living public space for quite a long time.
And it's taught us really one thing, and that is to truly make good public space, you have to erase the distinctions between architecture, urbanism, landscape, media design and so on.
It really goes beyond distinction.
Now we're moving onto Washington, D.C.
and we're working on another transformation, and that is for the existing Hirshhorn Museum that's sited on the most revered public space in America, the National Mall.
The Mall is a symbol of American democracy.
And what's fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing, it's not an image, it's not an artifact, actually it's a space, and it's kind of just defined by a line of buildings on either side.
It's a space where citizens can voice their discontent and show their power.
It's a place where pivotal moments in American history have taken place.
And they're inscribed in there forever -- like the march on Washington for jobs and freedom and the great speech that Martin Luther King gave there.
The Vietnam protests, the commemoration of all that died in the pandemic of AIDS, the march for women's reproductive rights, right up until almost the present.
The Mall is the greatest civic stage in this country for dissent.
And it's synonymous with free speech, even if you're not sure what it is that you have to say.
It may just be a place for civic commiseration.
There is a huge disconnect, we believe, between the communicative and discursive space of the Mall and the museums that line it to either side.
And that is that those museums are usually passive, they have passive relationships between the museum as the presenter and the audience, as the receiver of information.
And so you can see dinosaurs and insects and collections of locomotives and all of that, but you're really not involved; you're being talked to.
When Richard Koshalek took over as director of the Hirshhorn in 2009, he was determined to take advantage of the fact that this museum was sited at the most unique place: at the seat of power in the U.S.
And while art and politics are inherently and implicitly together always and all the time, there could be some very special relationship that could be forged here in its uniqueness.
The question is, is it possible ultimately for art to insert itself into the dialogue of national and world affairs?
And could the museum be an agent of cultural diplomacy?
There are over 180 embassies in Washington D.C.
There are over 500 think tanks.
There should be a way of harnessing all of that intellectual and global energy into, and somehow through, the museum.
There should be some kind of brain trust.
So the Hirshhorn, as we began to think about it, and as we evolved the mission, with Richard and his team -- it's really his life blood.
But beyond exhibiting contemporary art, the Hirshhorn will become a public forum, a place of discourse for issues around arts, culture, politics and policy.
It would have the global reach of the World Economic Forum.
It would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference.
It would have the informality of the town square.
And for this new initiative, the Hirshhorn would have to expand or appropriate a site for a contemporary, deployable structure.
This is it. This is the Hirshhorn -- so a 230-foot-diameter concrete doughnut designed in the early '70s by Gordon Bunshaft.
It's hulking, it's silent, it's cloistered, it's arrogant, it's a design challenge.
Architects love to hate it.
One redeeming feature is it's lifted up off the ground and it's got this void, and it's got an empty core kind of in the spirit and that facade very much corporate and federal style.
And around that space, the ring is actually galleries.
Very, very difficult to mount shows in there.
When the Hirshhorn opened, Ada Louise Huxstable, the New York Times critic, had some choice words: "Neo-penitentiary modern."
"A maimed monument and a maimed Mall for a maimed collection."
Almost four decades later, how will this building expand for a new progressive program?
Where would it go?
It can't go in the Mall.
There is no space there.
It can't go in the courtyard.
It's already taken up by landscape and by sculptures.
Well there's always the hole.
But how could it take the space of that hole and not be buried in it invisibly?
How could it become iconic?
And what language would it take?
The Hirshhorn sits among the Mall's momumental institutions.
Most are neoclassical, heavy and opaque, made of stone or concrete.
And the question is, if one inhabits that space, what is the material of the Mall?
It has to be different from the buildings there.
It has to be something entirely different.
It has to be air.
In our imagination, it has to be light.
It has to be ephemeral. It has to be formless.
And it has to be free.
So this is the big idea.
It's a giant airbag.
The expansion takes the shape of its container and it oozes out wherever it can -- the top and sides.
But more poetically, we like to think of the structure as inhaling the democratic air of the Mall, bringing it into itself.
The before and the after.
It was dubbed "the bubble" by the press.
That was the lounge.
It's basically one big volume of air that just oozes out in every direction.
The membrane is translucent.
It's made of silcon-coated glass fiber.
And it's inflated twice a year for one month at a time.
This is the view from the inside.
So you might have been wondering how in the world did we get this approved by the federal government.
It had to be approved by actually two agencies.
And one is there to preserve the dignity and sanctity of the Mall.
I blush whenever I show this.
It is yours to interpret.
But one thing I can say is that it's a combination of iconoclasm and adoration.
There was also some creative interpretation involved.
The Congressional Buildings Act of 1910 limits the height of buildings in D.C.
to 130 feet, except for spires, towers, domes and minarettes.
This pretty much exempts monuments of the church and state.
And the bubble is 153 ft.
That's the Pantheon next to it.
It's about 1.2 million cubic feet of compressed air.
And so we argued it on the merits of being a dome.
So there it is, very stately, among all the stately buildings in the Mall.
And while this Hirshhorn is not landmarked, it's very, very historically sensitive.
And so we couldn't really touch its surfaces.
We couldn't leave any traces behind.
So we strained it from the edges, and we held it by cables.
It's a study of some bondage techniques, which are actually very, very important because it's hit by wind all the time.
There's one permanent steel ring at the top, but it can't be seen from any vantage point on the Mall.
There are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit.
It glows from within, it's translucent.
But it can't be more lit than the Capitol or some of the monuments.
So it's down the hierarchy on lighting.
So it comes to the site twice a year.
It's taken off the delivery truck.
It's hoisted.
And then it's inflated with this low-pressure air.
And then it's restrained with the cables.
And then it's ballasted with water at the very bottom.
This is a very strange moment where we were asked by the bureaucracy at the Mall how much time would it take to install.
And we said, well the first erection would take one week.
And they really connected with that idea.
And then it was really easy all the way through.
So we didn't really have that many hurdles, I have to say, with the government and all the authorities.
But some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones.
This is the warp and weft.
This is a point cloud.
There are extreme pressures.
This is a very, very unusual building in that there's no gravity load, but there's load in every direction.
And I'm just going to zip through these slides.
And this is the space in action.
So flexible interior for discussions, just like this, but in the round -- luminous and reconfigurable.
Could be used for anything, for performances, films, for installations.
And the very first program will be one of cultural dialogue and diplomacy organized in partnership with the Council on Foreign Relations.
Form and content are together here.
The bubble is an anti-monument.
The ideals of participatory democracy are represented through suppleness rather than rigidity.
Art and politics occupy an ambiguous site outside the museum walls, but inside of the museum's core, blending its air with the democratic air of the Mall.
And the bubble will inflate hopefully for the first time at the end of 2013.
Thank you.

I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal.
And I come from a long way.
I've been telling a story that has been so painful for me.
It's been a tough journey for me, traveling the world, telling my story in form of a book.
And also telling it like now.
And also, the easiest one was when I was doing it in form of a music.
So I have branded myself as a war child.
I'm doing this because of an old lady in my village now, who have lost her children.
There is no newspaper to cover her pain, and what she wants to change in this society.
And I'm doing it for a young man who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice because he can't write.
Or there is no Internet, like Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, for them to talk.
Also one thing that kept me pushing this story, this painful stories out, the dreams I have, sometimes, is like the voices of the dead, that I have seen would tell me, "Don't give up. Keep on going."
Because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it, because I didn't know what I was putting myself into.
Well I was born in the most difficult time, when my country was at war.
I saw my village burned down.
The world that meant a lot to me, I saw it vanish in my face.
I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five.
My mother was claimed by the war.
My brothers and sisters were scattered.
And up to now, me and my father were detached and I still have issues with him.
Seeing people die every day, my mother crying, it's like I was raised in a violence.
And that made me call myself a war child.
And not only that, when I was eight I became a child soldier.
I didn't know what was the war for.
But one thing I knew was an image that I saw that stuck in my head.
When I went to the training camp I say, "I want to kill as many Muslims, and as many Arabs, as possible."
The training wasn't easy, but that was the driving force, because I wanted to revenge for my family.
I wanted to revenge for my village.
Luckily now things have changed because I came to discover the truth.
What was actually killing us wasn't the Muslims, wasn't the Arabs.
It was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system, and using religion to get what they want to get out of us, which is the oil, the diamond, the gold and the land.
So realizing the truth gave me a position to choose: should I continue to hate, or let it go?
So I happened to forgive. Now I sing music with the Muslims. I dance with them.
I even had a movie out called "War Child," funded by Muslim people.
So that pain has gone out.
But my story is huge.
So I'm just going to go into a different step now, which is easier for me.
I'm going to give you poem called "Forced to Sin," which is from my album "War Child."
I talk about my story.
One of the journey that I tread when I was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food and we were like around 400.
And only 16 people survived that journey.
So I hope you're going to hear this.
My dreams are like torment.
My every moment.
Voices in my brain, of friends that was slain.
Friends like Lual who died by my side, of starvation.
In the burning jungle, and the desert plain.
Next was I, but Jesus heard my cry.
As I was tempted to eat the rotten flesh of my comrade, he gave me comfort.
We used to raid villages, stealing chickens, goats and sheeps, anything we could eat.
I knew it was rude, but we needed food.
And therefore I was forced to sin, forced to sin to make a living, forced to sin to make a living.
Sometimes you gotta lose to win.
Never give up. Never give in.
Left home at the age of seven.
One year later, live with an AK-47 by my side.
Slept with one eye open wide.
Run, duck, play dead and hide.
I've seen my people die like flies.
But I've never seen a dead body, at least one that I've killed.
But still as I wonder, I won't go under.
Guns barking like lightning and thunder.
As a child so young and tender, Words I can't forget I still remember.
I saw sergeant command raising his hand, no retreat, no surrender.
I carry the banner of the trauma.
War child, child without a mama, still fighting in the saga.
Yet as I wage this new war I'm not alone in this drama.
No sit or stop, as I reach for the top I'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop.
I'm on a fight, day and night.
Sometime I do wrong in order to make things right.
It's like I'm living a dream.
First time I'm feeling like a human being.
Ah! The children of Darfur.
Your empty bellies on the telly and now it's you that I'm fighting for.
Left home.
Don't even know the day I'll ever return.
My country is war-torn.
Music I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns.
So many people die that I don't even cry no more.
Ask God question, what am I here for.
And why are my people poor.
And why, why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write, I was learning how to fight.
I ate snails, vultures, rabbits, snakes, and anything that had life.
I was ready to eat.
I know it's a shame. But who is to be blamed?
That's my story shared in the form of a lesson.
Thank you.
What energized me and kept me going is the music I do.
I never saw anybody to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy.
So the music had been my therapy for me.
It's been where I actually see heaven, where I can be happy, where I can be a child again, in dances, through music.
So one thing I know about music: music is the only thing that has power to enter your cell system, your mind, your heart, influence your soul and your spirit, and can even influence the way you live without even you knowing.
Music is the only thing that can make you want to wake up your bed and shake your leg, without even wanting to do it.
And so the power music has I normally compare to the power love when love doesn't see a color.
You know, if you fall in love with a frog, that's it.
One testimony about how I find music is powerful is when I was still a soldier back then.
I hated the people in the north.
But I don't know why I don't hate their music.
So we party and dance to their music.
And one thing that shocked me is one day they brought an Arab musician to come and entertain the soldiers.
And I almost broke my leg dancing to his music.
But I had this question.
So now I'm doing music so I know what the power of music is.
So what's happening here?
I've been in a painful journey.
Today is day number 233 in which I only eat dinner.
I don't eat breakfast. No lunch.
And I've done a campaign called Lose to Win.
Where I'm losing so that I could win the battle that I'm fighting now.
So my breakfast, my lunch, I donate it to a charity that I founded because we want to build a school in Sudan.
And I'm doing this because also it's a normal thing in my home, people eat one meal a day.
Here I am in the West. I choose not to.
So in my village now, kids there, they normally listen to BBC, or any radio, and they are waiting to know, the day Emmanuel will eat his breakfast it means he got the money to build our school.
And so I made a commitment. I say, "I'm gonna not eat my breakfast."
I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month, but I've been humbled.
So it's taken me 232 days.
And I said, "No stop until we get it."
And like it's been done on Facebook, MySpace.
The people are giving three dollars.
The lowest amount we ever got was 20 cents.
Somebody donated 20 cents online.
I don't know how they did it.
But that moved me.
And so, the importance of education to me is what I'm willing to die for.
I'm willing to die for this, because I know what it can do to my people.
Education enlighten your brain, give you so many chances, and you're able to survive.
As a nation we have been crippled.
For so many years we have fed on aid.
You see a 20-years-old, 30-years-old families in a refugee camps.
They only get the food that drops from the sky, from the U.N.
So these people, you're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid.
If anybody want to help us this is what we need.
Give us tools. Give the farmers tools.
It's rain. Africa is fertile. They can grow the crops.
Invest in education.
Education so that we have strong institution that can create a revolution to change everything.
Because we have all those old men that are creating wars in Africa. They will die soon.
But if you invest in education then we'll be able to change Africa.
That's what I'm asking.
So in order to do that, I founded a charter called Gua Africa, where we put kids in school.
And now we have a couple in university.
We have like 40 kids, ex-child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support.
And I said "I'm going to put it in practice."
And with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things.
That's what I want to do to change, to make a difference in the world.
Well now, my time is going, so I want to sing a song.
But I'll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a British aid worker called Emma McCune that made it possible for me to be here.
I'm gonna sing this song, just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference.
She came to my country and saw the importance of education.
She said the only way to help Sudan is to invest in the women, educating them, educating the children, so that they could come and create a revolution in this complex society.
So she even ended up marrying a commander from the SPLA.
And she rescued over 150 child soldiers.
One of them happened to be me now.
And so at this moment I want to ask to celebrate Emma with me.
Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma?
Audience: Yes!
Emmanuel Jal: All right.
This one goes to Emma McCune Angel to rescue came one afternoon I'm here because you rescued me I'm proud to carry your legacy Thank you. Bless you. R.I.P. What would I be? Me! If Emma never rescued me? What would I be? What would I be? Me! Another starving refugee What would I be? What would I be? Me! If Emma never rescued me? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You would have seen my face on the telly Fat hungry belly Flies in my eyes, head too big for my size Just another little starving child Running around in Africa, born to be wild Praise God, praise the Almighty for sending an angel to rescue me I got a reason for being on this Earth 'Cause I know more than many what a life is worth Now that I got a chance to stand my ground I'm gonna run over mountains, leaps and bounds I ain't an angel, hope I'll be one soon And if I am, I wanna be like Emma McCune Me! What would I be? Me! If Emma never rescued me? What would I be? What would I be? Me! Another starving refugee What would I be? What would I be? Me! If Emma never rescued me? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, Yeah! I would have probably died from starvation Or some other wretched disease I would have grown up with no education Just another refugee I stand here because somebody cared I stand here because somebody dared I know there is a lot of Emmas out there Who is willing and trying to save a life of a child What would I be? Me! If Emma never rescued me? What would I be? What would I be? Another starving refugee I remember the time when I was small When I couldn't read or write at all Now I'm all grown up, I got my education The sky is the limit and I can't be stopped by no one How I prayed for this day to come And I pray that the world find wisdom To give the poor in need some assistance Instead of putting up resistance, yeah Sitting and waiting for the politics to fix this It ain't gonna happen They're all sitting on they asses Popping champagne and sponging off the masses Coming from a refugee boy-soldier But I still got my dignity I gotta say it again If Emma never rescued me I'd be a corpse on the African plain Is there anybody who's here in the back, some love.
Big scream for Emma everybody.
Yeah! I'm gonna get crazy now.
What would I be? If Emma never rescued me? What would I be? Another starving refugee What would I be? If Emma never rescued me? Yeah, Yeah Yeah, I would have probably died from starvation Or some other wretched disease I would have grown up with no education Just another refugee Thank you.
Go save a life of a child.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/david_r_dow_lessons_from_death_row_inmates.html</url>
Two weeks ago, I was sitting at the kitchen table with my wife Katya, and we were talking about what I was gonna talk about today.
We have an 11-year-old son; his name is Lincoln. He was sitting at the same table doing his math homework.
And during a pause in my conversation with Katya, I looked over at Lincoln and I was suddenly thunderstruck by a recollection of a client of mine.
My client was a guy named Will.
He was from North Texas.
He never knew his father very well, because his father left his mom while she was pregnant with him.
And so, he was destined to be raised by a single mom, which might have been all right except that this particular single mom was a paranoid schizophrenic, and when Will was five years old she tried to kill him with a butcher knife.
She was taken away by authorities and placed in a psychiatric hospital, and so for the next several years Will lived with his older brother until he committed suicide by shooting himself through the heart.
And after that Will bounced around from one family member to another, until, by the time he was nine years old, he was essentially living on his own.
That morning that I was sitting with Katya and Lincoln, I looked at my son, and I realized that when my client, Will, was his age, he'd been living by himself for two years.
Will eventually joined a gang and committed a number of very serious crimes, including, most seriously of all, a horrible, tragic murder.
And Will was ultimately executed as punishment for that crime.
But I don't want to talk today about the morality of capital punishment. I certainly think that my client shouldn't have been executed, but what I would like to do today instead is talk about the death penalty in a way I've never done before, in a way that is entirely noncontroversial.
I think that's possible, because there is a corner of the death penalty debate -- maybe the most important corner -- where everybody agrees, where the most ardent death penalty supporters and the most vociferous abolitionists are on exactly the same page.
That's the corner I want to explore.
Before I do that, though, I want to spend a couple of minutes telling you how a death penalty case unfolds, and then I want to tell you two lessons that I have learned over the last 20 years as a death penalty lawyer, from watching well more than a hundred cases unfold in this way.
You can think of a death penalty case as a story that has four chapters.
The first chapter of every case is exactly the same, and it is tragic.
It begins with the murder of an innocent human being, and it's followed by a trial where the murderer is convicted and sent to death row, and that death sentence is ultimately upheld by the state appellate court.
The second chapter consists of a complicated legal proceeding known as a state habeas corpus appeal.
The third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding known as a federal habeas corpus proceeding.
And the fourth chapter is one where a variety of things can happen. The lawyers might file a clemency petition, they might initiate even more complex litigation, or they might not do anything at all.
But that fourth chapter always ends with an execution.
When I started representing death row inmates more than 20 years ago, people on death row did not have a right to a lawyer in either the second or the fourth chapter of this story.
They were on their own.
In fact, it wasn't until the late 1980s that they acquired a right to a lawyer during the third chapter of the story.
So what all of these death row inmates had to do was rely on volunteer lawyers to handle their legal proceedings.
The problem is that there were way more guys on death row than there were lawyers who had both the interest and the expertise to work on these cases.
And so inevitably, lawyers drifted to cases that were already in chapter four -- that makes sense, of course. Those are the cases that are most urgent; those are the guys who are closest to being executed.
Some of these lawyers were successful; they managed to get new trials for their clients.
Others of them managed to extend the lives of their clients, sometimes by years, sometimes by months.
But the one thing that didn't happen was that there was never a serious and sustained decline in the number of annual executions in Texas.
In fact, as you can see from this graph, from the time that the Texas execution apparatus got efficient in the mid- to late-1990s, there've only been a couple of years where the number of annual executions dipped below 20.
In a typical year in Texas, we're averaging about two people a month.
In some years in Texas, we've executed close to 40 people, and this number has never significantly declined over the last 15 years.
And yet, at the same time that we continue to execute about the same number of people every year, the number of people who we're sentencing to death on an annual basis has dropped rather steeply.
So we have this paradox, which is that the number of annual executions has remained high but the number of new death sentences has gone down.
Why is that?
It can't be attributed to a decline in the murder rate, because the murder rate has not declined nearly so steeply as the red line on that graph has gone down.
What has happened instead is that juries have started to sentence more and more people to prison for the rest of their lives without the possibility of parole, rather than sending them to the execution chamber.
Why has that happened?
it hasn't happened because of a dissolution of popular support for the death penalty. Death penalty opponents take great solace in the fact that death penalty support in Texas is at an all-time low.
Do you know what all-time low in Texas means?
It means that it's in the low 60 percent.
Now that's really good compared to the mid 1980s, when it was in excess of 80 percent, but we can't explain the decline in death sentences and the affinity for life without the possibility of parole by an erosion of support for the death penalty, because people still support the death penalty.
What's happened to cause this phenomenon?
that lawyers who represent death row inmates have shifted their focus to earlier and earlier chapters of the death penalty story.
So 25 years ago, they focused on chapter four.
And they went from chapter four 25 years ago to chapter three in the late 1980s.
And they went from chapter three in the late 1980s to chapter two in the mid-1990s. And beginning in the mid- to late-1990s, they began to focus on chapter one of the story.
Now you might think that this decline in death sentences and the increase in the number of life sentences is a good thing or a bad thing.
I don't want to have a conversation about that today.
All that I want to tell you is that the reason that this has happened is because death penalty lawyers have understood that the earlier you intervene in a case, the greater the likelihood that you're going to save your client's life.
That's the first thing I've learned.
Here's the second thing I learned: My client Will was not the exception to the rule; he was the rule.
I sometimes say, if you tell me the name of a death row inmate -- doesn't matter what state he's in, doesn't matter if I've ever met him before -- I'll write his biography for you.
And eight out of 10 times, the details of that biography will be more or less accurate.
And the reason for that is that 80 percent of the people on death row are people who came from the same sort of dysfunctional family that Will did.
Eighty percent of the people on death row are people who had exposure to the juvenile justice system.
That's the second lesson that I've learned.
Now we're right on the cusp of that corner where everybody's going to agree.
People in this room might disagree about whether Will should have been executed, but I think everybody would agree that the best possible version of his story would be a story where no murder ever occurs.
How do we do that?
When our son Lincoln was working on that math problem two weeks ago, it was a big, gnarly problem.
And he was learning how, when you have a big old gnarly problem, sometimes the solution is to slice it into smaller problems.
That's what we do for most problems -- in math and physics, even in social policy -- we slice them into smaller, more manageable problems.
But every once in a while, as Dwight Eisenhower said, the way you solve a problem is to make it bigger.
The way we solve this problem is to make the issue of the death penalty bigger.
We have to say, all right.
We have these four chapters of a death penalty story, but what happens before that story begins?
How can we intervene in the life of a murderer before he's a murderer?
What options do we have to nudge that person that is going to lead to a result that everybody -- death penalty supporters and death penalty opponents -- still think is a bad result: the murder of an innocent human being?
You know, sometimes people say that something isn't rocket science.
And by that, what they mean is rocket science is really complicated and this problem that we're talking about now is really simple.
Well that's rocket science; that's the mathematical expression for the thrust created by a rocket.
What we're talking about today is just as complicated.
What we're talking about today is also rocket science.
My client Will and 80 percent of the people on death row had five chapters in their lives that came before the four chapters of the death penalty story.
I think of these five chapters as points of intervention, places in their lives when our society could've intervened in their lives and nudged them off of the path that they were on that created a consequence that we all -- death penalty supporters or death penalty opponents -- say was a bad result.
Now, during each of these five chapters: when his mother was pregnant with him; in his early childhood years; when he was in elementary school; when he was in middle school and then high school; and when he was in the juvenile justice system -- during each of those five chapters, there were a wide variety of things that society could have done.
In fact, if we just imagine that there are five different modes of intervention, the way that society could intervene in each of those five chapters, and we could mix and match them any way we want, there are 3,000 -- more than 3,000 -- possible strategies that we could embrace in order to nudge kids like Will off of the path that they're on.
So I'm not standing here today with the solution.
But the fact that we still have a lot to learn, that doesn't mean that we don't know a lot already.
We know from experience in other states that there are a wide variety of modes of intervention that we could be using in Texas, and in every other state that isn't using them, in order to prevent a consequence that we all agree is bad.
I'll just mention a few.
I won't talk today about reforming the legal system.
That's probably a topic that is best reserved for a room full of lawyers and judges.
Instead, let me talk about a couple of modes of intervention that we can all help accomplish, because they are modes of intervention that will come about when legislators and policymakers, when taxpayers and citizens, agree that that's what we ought to be doing and that's how we ought to be spending our money.
We could be providing early childhood care for economically disadvantaged and otherwise troubled kids, and we could be doing it for free.
And we could be nudging kids like Will off of the path that we're on.
There are other states that do that, but we don't.
We could be providing special schools, at both the high school level and the middle school level, but even in K-5, that target economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids, and particularly kids who have had exposure to the juvenile justice system.
There are a handful of states that do that; Texas doesn't.
There's one other thing we can be doing -- well, there are a bunch of other things that we could be doing -- there's one other thing that we could be doing that I'm going to mention, and this is gonna be the only controversial thing that I say today.
We could be intervening much more aggressively into dangerously dysfunctional homes, and getting kids out of them before their moms pick up butcher knives and threaten to kill them.
If we're gonna do that, we need a place to put them.
Even if we do all of those things, some kids are going to fall through the cracks and they're going to end up in that last chapter before the murder story begins, they're going to end up in the juvenile justice system.
And even if that happens, it's not yet too late.
There's still time to nudge them, if we think about nudging them rather than just punishing them.
There are two professors in the Northeast -- one at Yale and one at Maryland -- they set up a school that is attached to a juvenile prison.
And the kids are in prison, but they go to school from eight in the morning until four in the afternoon.
Now, it was logistically difficult.
They had to recruit teachers who wanted to teach inside a prison, they had to establish strict separation between the people who work at the school and the prison authorities, and most dauntingly of all, they needed to invent a new curriculum because you know what?
People don't come into and out of prison on a semester basis.
But they did all those things.
Now what do all of these things have in common?
What all of these things have in common is that they cost money.
Some of the people in the room might be old enough to remember the guy on the old oil filter commercial.
He used to say, "Well, you can pay me now or you can pay me later."
What we're doing in the death penalty system is we're paying later.
But the thing is that for every 15,000 dollars that we spend intervening in the lives of economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids in those earlier chapters, we save 80,000 dollars in crime-related costs down the road.
Even if you don't agree that there's a moral imperative that we do it, it just makes economic sense.
I want to tell you about the last conversation that I had with Will.
It was the day that he was going to be executed, and we were just talking.
There was nothing left to do in his case.
And we were talking about his life.
And he was talking first about his dad, who he hardly knew, who had died, and then about his mom, who he did know, who is still alive.
And I said to him, "I know the story.
I've read the records.
I know that she tried to kill you."
I said, "But I've always wondered whether you really actually remember that."
I said, "I don't remember anything from when I was five years old.
Maybe you just remember somebody telling you."
And he looked at me and he leaned forward, and he said, "Professor," -- he'd known me for 12 years, he still called me Professor.
He said, "Professor, I don't mean any disrespect by this, but when your mama picks up a butcher knife that looks bigger than you are, and chases you through the house screaming she's gonna kill you, and you have to lock yourself in the bathroom and lean against the door and holler for help until the police get there," he looked at me and he said, "that's something you don't forget."
I hope there's one thing you all won't forget: In between the time you arrived here this morning and the time we break for lunch, there are going to be four homicides in the United States.
We're going to devote enormous social resources to punishing the people who commit those crimes, and that's appropriate, because we should punish people who do bad things.
But three of those crimes are preventable.
If we make the picture bigger and devote our attention to the earlier chapters, then we're never going to write the first sentence that begins the death penalty story.
Thank you.

<title>David R. Dow: Lessons from death row inmates</title>
<description>What happens before a murder? In looking for ways to reduce death penalty cases, David R. Dow realized that a surprising number of death row inmates had similar biographies. In this talk he proposes a bold plan, one that prevents murders in the first place. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

On September 10, the morning of my seventh birthday, I came downstairs to the kitchen, where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something, and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway, and they said, "Hey, happy birthday!" And I said, "I'm seven."
And my father smiled and said, "Well, you know what that means, don't you?"
And I said, "Yeah, that I'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents?" And my dad said, "Well, yes.
But, more importantly, being seven means that you've reached the age of reason, and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man."
Now, I had heard this phrase, "age of reason," before.
Sister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about my second-grade class at school. But when she said it, the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession, and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil, and anyway, I hadn't really paid all that much attention to that phrase, "age of reason."
So, I said, "Yeah, yeah, age of reason. What does that mean again?"
And my dad said, "Well, we believe in the Catholic Church that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong, but when you're seven, you're old enough to know better.
So, you've grown up, and reached the age of reason, and now God will start keeping notes on you and begin your permanent record."
And I said, "Oh. Wait a minute. You mean all that time, up till today, all that time I was so good, God didn't notice it?"
And my mom said, "Well, I noticed it."
And I thought, "How could I not have known this before?
How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me?
All that being good and no real credit for it.
And, worst of all, how could I not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me?"
So I said, "Well, Mom and Dad, what about Santa Claus?
I mean, Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice, right?"
And my dad said, "Yeah, but, honey, I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas."
And my mother said, "Oh, Bob, stop it. Let's just tell her.
I mean, she's seven. Julie, there is no Santa Claus."
Now, this was actually not that upsetting to me.
My parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus: how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed that instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve, like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning, our family would give Santa more time.
Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning, but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss.
Which made me very suspicious.
It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents.
I mean, my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style, and my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's.
Plus, why would Santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's?
There's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence: our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit, and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment, this humiliation of rejection by Santa, who was jolly -- but, let's face it, he was also very judgmental.
So, to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief.
I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa, but rather I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing.
It was too late for me, but maybe I could help someone else, someone who could use the information.
They had to fit two criteria: they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason, and not yet seven.
The answer was clear: my brother Bill. He was six.
Well, I finally found Bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground. It was a Saturday, and he was all by himself, just kicking a ball against the side of a wall.
I ran up to him and said, "Bill!
I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven, and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against God and man." And Bill said, "So?" And then I said, "So, you're six. You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it." And he said, "So?" And I said, "So? So everything!" And I turned to run. I was so angry with him.
But when I got to the top of the steps, I turned around dramatically and said, "Oh, by the way, Bill, there is no Santa Claus."
Now, I didn't know it at the time, but I really wasn't turning seven on September 10.
For my 13th birthday, I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends, but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said, "I need to speak to you privately.
September 10 is not your birthday. It's October 10." And I said, "What?"
And she said, "Listen. The cut-off date to start kindergarten was September 15."
"So, I told them that your birthday was on September 10, and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place, so I started to tell you your birthday was September 10.
But, Julie, you were so ready to start school, honey. You were so ready."
I thought about it, and when I was four, I was already the oldest of four children, and my mother even had another child to come, so what I think she understandably really meant was that she was so ready, she was so ready. Then she said, "Don't worry, Julie, every year on October 10 when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it, I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day."
Which was comforting, but troubling.
My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me, without me.
What was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that I was going to have to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends, what was most upsetting was that this meant that I was not a Virgo.
I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom, and I read my horoscope every single day, and it was so totally me.
And this meant that I was a Libra?
So, I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster.
The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair, sort of lounging by some water, but the Libra poster is just a huge scale.
This was around the time that I started filling out physically, and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls, and, frankly, the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing.
But I got the new Libra poster, and I started to read my new Libra horoscope, and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me.
It wasn't until years later, looking back on this whole age-of-reason/change-of-birthday thing, that it dawned on me: I wasn't turning seven when I thought I turned seven. I had a whole other month to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me.
Oh, life can be so cruel.
One day, two Mormon missionaries came to my door.
Now, I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles, and my block is -- well, it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door.
Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven.
And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them.
So, normally I just ignore the doorbell, but on this day I answered.
And there stood two boys, each about 19, in white starched short-sleeved shirts, and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and they said they had a message for me from God.
I said, "A message for me? From God?" And they said, "Yes."
Now, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest, around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know, I've worked with them and even dated them, but I never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission, and I guess I was, sort of, curious, so I said, "Well, please, come in." And they looked really happy, because I don't think this happens to them all that often.
And I sat them down, and I got them glasses of water -- OK, I got it. I got them glasses of water.
Don't touch my hair, that's the thing.
You can't put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair.
OK. So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water, and after niceties they said, "Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart?"
And I thought, "Well, of course I believe in God, but, you know, I don't like that word, heart, because it anthropomorphizes God, and I don't like the word, 'his,' either, because that sexualizes God."
But I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys, so after a very long, uncomfortable pause, I said "Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved."
And they looked at each other and smiled, like that was the right answer. And then they said, "Do you believe that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet?"
And I said, "Yes, I do. Yes, I do." And I was so relieved that it was a question I could answer so quickly.
And they said, "Well, then we have a story to tell you."
And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi, who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC.
Now, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC, everyone was completely bad and evil. Every single one of them: man, woman, child, infant, fetus.
And God came to Lehi and said to him, "Put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here." And God did lead them.
He led them to America.
I said, "America? From Jerusalem to America by boat in 600 BC?"
And they said, "Yes."
Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced, and over the course of 600 years there were two great races of them, the Nephites and the Lamanites, and the Nephites were totally, totally good -- each and every one of them -- and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil -- every single one of them just bad to the bone.
Then, after Jesus died on the cross for our sins, on his way up to heaven he stopped by America and visited the Nephites.
And he told them that if they all remained totally, totally good -- each and every one of them -- they would win the war against the evil Lamanites.
But apparently somebody blew it, because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites.
All but one guy, this guy named Mormon, who managed to survive by hiding in the woods.
And he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates, which he then buried near Palmyra, New York.
Well, I was just on the edge of my seat.
I said, "What happened to the Lamanites?"
And they said, "Well, they became our Native Americans here in the U.S."
And I said, "So, you believe the Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil?" And they said, "Yes."
Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith found those buried gold plates right in his backyard, and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into, and this allowed him to translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English.
Well, at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch.
I wanted to say, "OK, don't start with this story."
I mean, even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start -- -- telling people all about Xenu, the evil intergalactic overlord.
Well, then they said, "Do you believe that God speaks to us through his righteous prophets?" And I said, "No, I don't."
Because I was, sort of, upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story, but the truth was, I hadn't really thought this through, so I backpedaled a little and I said, "Well, what exactly do you mean by righteous?
And what do you mean by prophets? Like, could the prophets be women?"
And they said, "No." And I said, "Why?" And they said, "Well, it's because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular, it is so wonderful, that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy."
What is this wonderful gift God gave women, I wondered?
Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt?
Women's longer lifespan? The fact that women tend to be much less violent than men? But, no, it wasn't any of these gifts.
They said, "Well, it's her ability to bear children."
I said, "Oh, come on. I mean, even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45, assuming they didn't die from exhaustion, it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God." And they said, "No."
Well, then they didn't look so fresh-faced and cute to me any more, but they had more to say.
They said, "Well, we also believe that if you're a Mormon and if you're in good standing with the church, when you die you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity."
And I said, "Oh, dear -- -- that wouldn't be such a good incentive for me."
And they said, "Oh -- hey, well, we also believe that when you go to heaven you get your body restored to you in its best original state.
Like, if you'd lost a leg, well, you get it back.
Or, if you'd gone blind, you could see."
I said, "Oh -- now, I don't have a uterus because I had cancer a few years ago. So, does this mean that if I went to heaven I would get my old uterus back?" And they said, "Sure."
And I said, "I don't want it back. I'm happy without it." Gosh.
What if you had a nose job and you liked it?
Would God force you to get your old nose back?
Well, then they gave me this Book of Mormon, and they told me to read this chapter and that chapter, and they said they'd come back some day and check in on me, and I think I said something like, "Please don't hurry," or maybe it was just, "Please don't," and they were gone.
OK, so, I initially felt really superior to these boys, and smug in my more conventional faith. But then, the more I thought about it, the more I had to be honest with myself.
If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time, and they said, "We believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse, and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us -- -- and she had a baby, and that's the son of God," I mean, I would think that's equally ridiculous.
I'm just so used to that story.
So, I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys.
But the question they asked me when they first arrived really stuck in my head: Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart?
Because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question.
Now, if they'd asked me, Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart?
Well, that would have been much different, I think I would have instantly answered, "Yes, yes, I feel it all the time. I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused, and I feel consoled and cared for. I take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hits, and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see."
But since they asked me that question with the word believe in it, somehow it was all different, because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt.

Martin Luther King did not say, "I have a nightmare," when he inspired the civil rights movements.
He said, "I have a dream."
And I have a dream.
I have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare, and this is going to be a challenge, because, if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times, nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic.
I think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times, "The Road."
It's a beautiful piece of filmmaking, but everything is desolate, everything is dead.
And just a father and son trying to survive, walking along the road.
And I think the environmental movement of which I am a part of has been complicit in creating this vision of the future.
For too long, we have peddled a nightmarish vision of what's going to happen.
We have focused on the worst-case scenario.
We have focused on the problems.
And we have not thought enough about the solutions.
We've used fear, if you like, to grab people's attention.
And any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism.
It's part of the fight and flight mechanism, that when an animal is frightened -- think of a deer.
A deer freezes very, very still, poised to run away.
And I think that's what we're doing when we're asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change.
People are freezing and running away because we're using fear.
And I think the environmental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is.
What would it be like to be improving the human lot?
And one of the problems that we face, I think, is that the only people that have cornered the market in terms of progress is a financial definition of what progress is, an economic definition of what progress is -- that somehow, if we get the right numbers to go up, we're going to be better off, whether that's on the stock market, whether that's with GDP and economic growth, that somehow life is going to get better.
This is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear -- that more is better.
Come on. In the Western world, we have enough.
Maybe some parts of the world don't, but we have enough.
And we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations.
In fact, the architect of our national accounting system, Simon Kuznets, in the 1930s, said that, "A nation's welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income."
But we've created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff.
And indeed, this is probably historical, and it had its time.
In the second World War, we needed to produce a lot of stuff.
And indeed, we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed a lot of Europe, and we had to rebuild it afterwards.
And so our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce.
But as early as 1968, this visionary man, Robert Kennedy, at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign, gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product And he finished his talk with the phrase, that, "The gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile."
How crazy is that? That our measure of progress, our dominant measure of progress in society, is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile?
I believe, if Kennedy was alive today, he would be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile.
He'd be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice, sustainability and people's well-being.
And actually, social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world.
This is from a global survey.
It's asking people, what do they want.
And unsurprisingly, people all around the world say that what they want is happiness, for themselves, for their families, their children, their communities.
Okay, they think money is slightly important.
It's there, but it's not nearly as important as happiness, and it's not nearly as important as love.
We all need to love and be loved in life.
It's not nearly as important as health.
We want to be healthy and live a full life.
These seem to be natural human aspirations.
Why are statisticians not measuring these?
Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms, instead of just how much stuff we have?
And really, this is what I've done with my adult life -- is think about how do we measure happiness, how do we measure well-being, how can we do that within environmental limits.
And we created, at the organization that I work for, the New Economics Foundation, something we call the Happy Planet Index, because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy.
Why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that?
And what we do, is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens.
That should be the goal of every nation on the planet.
But we have to remember that there's a fundamental input to that, and that is how many of the planet's resources we use.
We all have one planet. We all have to share it.
It is the ultimate scarce resource, the one planet that we share.
And economics is very interested in scarcity.
When it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome, it thinks in terms of efficiency.
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck.
And this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our planetary resource use.
It is an efficiency measure.
And probably the easiest way to show you that, is to show you this graph.
Running horizontally along the graph, is "ecological footprint," which is a measure of how much resources we use and how much pressure we put on the planet.
More is bad.
Running vertically upwards, is a measure called "happy life years."
It's about the well-being of nations.
It's like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy.
It's like quality and quantity of life in nations.
And the yellow dot there you see, is the global average.
Now, there's a huge array of nations around that global average.
To the top right of the graph, are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being, but they're using a lot of planet to get there.
They are the U.S.A., other Western countries going across in those triangles and a few Gulf states in there actually.
Conversely, at the bottom left of the graph, are countries that are not producing much well-being -- typically, sub-Saharan Africa.
In Hobbesian terms, life is short and brutish there.
The average life expectancy in many of these countries is only 40 years.
Malaria, HIV/AIDS are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world.
But now for the good news!
There are some countries up there, yellow triangles, that are doing better than global average, that are heading up towards the top left of the graph.
This is an aspirational graph.
We want to be top left, where good lives don't cost the earth.
They're Latin American.
The country on its own up at the top is a place I haven't been to.
Maybe some of you have.
Costa Rica.
Costa Rica -- average life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years.
That is longer than in the USA.
They are, according to the latest Gallup world poll, the happiest nation on the planet -- than anybody; more than Switzerland and Denmark.
They are the happiest place.
They are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in [the] Western world -- a quarter of the resources.
What's going on there?
What's happening in Costa Rica?
We can look at some of the data.
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources.
Their government is one of the first to commit to be carbon neutral by 2021.
They abolished the army in 1949 -- 1949.
And they invested in social programs -- health and education.
They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America and in the world.
And they have that Latin vibe, don't they.
They have the social connectedness.
The challenge is, that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about -- is that the future might not be North American, might not be Western European.
It might be Latin American.
And the challenge, really, is to pull the global average up here.
That's what we need to do.
And if we're going to do that, we need to pull countries from the bottom, and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph.
And then we're starting to create a happy planet.
That's one way of looking at it.
Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends.
We don't have good data going back for every country in the world, but for some of the richest countries, the OECD group, we do.
And this is the trend in well-being over that time, a small increase, but this is the trend in ecological footprint.
And so in strict happy-planet methodology, we've become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to.
And the point really is, is that I think, probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 2050 without an apocalyptic something happening.
It's actually not very long away.
It's half a human lifetime away.
A child entering school today will be my age in 2050.
This is not the very distant future.
This is what the U.K. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like.
And I put it to you, that is not business as usual.
That is changing our business.
That is changing the way we create our organizations, we do our government policy and we live our lives.
And the point is, we need to carry on increasing well-being.
No one can go to the polls and say that quality of life is going to reduce.
None of us, I think, want human progress to stop.
I think we want it to carry on.
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing.
And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in.
I think this is what they want. They want quality of life to keep increasing.
They want to hold on to what they've got.
And if we're going to engage them, I think that's what we've got to do.
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more.
Now that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that, but the point is we need to turn those curves.
And this is where I think we can take a leaf out of systems theory, systems engineers, where they create feedback loops, put the right information at the right point of time.
Human beings are very motivated by the "now."
You put a smart meter in your home, and you see how much electricity you're using right now, how much it's costing you, your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly.
What would that look like for society?
Why is it, on the radio news every evening, I hear the FTSE 100, the Dow Jones, the dollar pound ratio -- I don't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news.
And why do I hear that?
Why don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday, or American used yesterday?
Did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions?
That's how you create a collective goal.
You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it.
And we need positive feedback loops for increasing well-being At a government level, they might create national accounts of well-being.
At a business level, you might look at the well-being of your employees, which we know is really linked to creativity, which is linked to innovation, and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues.
At a personal level, we need these nudges too.
Maybe we don't quite need the data, but we need reminders.
In the U.K., we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do -- never my best thing.
What are these for happiness?
What are the five things that you should do every day to be happier?
We did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago, a big program called the Foresight program -- lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts -- everything evidence based -- a huge tome.
But a piece of work we did was on: what five positive actions can you do to improve well-being in your life?
And the point of these is they are, not quite, the secrets of happiness, but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from.
And the first of these is to connect, is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life.
Do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do, and energy?
Keep building them.
The second one is be active.
The fastest way out of a bad mood: step outside, go for a walk, turn the radio on and dance.
Being active is great for our positive mood.
The third one is take notice.
How aware are you of things going on around the world, the seasons changing, people around you?
Do you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge?
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, [very] strong for our well being.
The fourth is keep learning and keep is important -- learning throughout the whole life course.
Older people who keep learning and are curious, they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down.
But it doesn't have to be formal learning; it's not knowledge based.
It's more curiosity.
It can be learning to cook a new dish, picking up an instrument you forgot as a child.
Keep learning.
And the final one is that most anti-economic of activities, but give.
Our generosity, our altruism, our compassion, are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain.
We feel good if we give.
You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning.
You tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people.
You measure their happiness at the end of the day, those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves.
And these five ways, which we put onto these handy postcards, I would say, don't have to cost the earth.
They don't have any carbon content.
They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied.
And so I think it's really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth.
Now, Martin Luther King, on the eve of his death, gave an incredible speech.
He said, "I know there are challenges ahead, there may be trouble ahead, but I fear no one. I don't care.
I have been to the mountain top, and I have seen the Promised Land."
Now, he was a preacher, but I believe the environmental movement and, in fact, the business community, government, needs to go to the top of the mountain top, and it needs to look out, and it needs to see the Promised Land, or the land of promise, and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want.
And not only that, we need to create a Great Transition to get there, and we need to pave that great transition with good things.
Human beings want to be happy.
Pave them with the five ways.
And we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them -- something like the Happy Planet Index.
And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want, where happiness does not cost the earth.

<description>Statistician Nic Marks asks why we measure a nation's success by its productivity -- instead of by the happiness and well-being of its people. He introduces the Happy Planet Index, which tracks national well-being against resource use . Which countries rank highest in the HPI? You might be surprised.</description>

You know, I'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of TED is compassion, these very moving demonstrations we've just seen: HIV in Africa, President Clinton last night.
And I'd like to do a little collateral thinking, if you will, about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal.
I'm a psychologist, but rest assured, I will not bring it to the scrotal.
There was a very important study done a while ago at Princeton Theological Seminary that speaks to why it is that when all of us have so many opportunities to help, we do sometimes, and we don't other times.
A group of divinity students at the Princeton Theological Seminary were told that they were going to give a practice sermon and they were each given a sermon topic.
Half of those students were given, as a topic, the parable of the Good Samaritan: the man who stopped the stranger in -- to help the stranger in need by the side of the road.
Half were given random Bible topics.
Then one by one, they were told they had to go to another building and give their sermon.
As they went from the first building to the second, each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning, clearly in need. The question is: Did they stop to help?
The more interesting question is: Did it matter they were contemplating the parable of the Good Samaritan? Answer: No, not at all.
What turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry they thought they were in -- were they feeling they were late, or were they absorbed in what they were going to talk about.
And this is, I think, the predicament of our lives: that we don't take every opportunity to help because our focus is in the wrong direction.
There's a new field in brain science, social neuroscience.
This studies the circuitry in two people's brains that activates while they interact.
And the new thinking about compassion from social neuroscience is that our default wiring is to help.
That is to say, if we attend to the other person, we automatically empathize, we automatically feel with them.
There are these newly identified neurons, mirror neurons, that act like a neuro Wi-Fi, activating in our brain exactly the areas activated in theirs. We feel "with" automatically.
And if that person is in need, if that person is suffering, we're automatically prepared to help. At least that's the argument.
But then the question is: Why don't we?
And I think this speaks to a spectrum that goes from complete self-absorption, to noticing, to empathy and to compassion.
And the simple fact is, if we are focused on ourselves, if we're preoccupied, as we so often are throughout the day, we don't really fully notice the other.
And this difference between the self and the other focus can be very subtle.
I was doing my taxes the other day, and I got to the point where I was listing all of the donations I gave, and I had an epiphany, it was -- I came to my check to the Seva Foundation and I noticed that I thought, boy, my friend Larry Brilliant would really be happy that I gave money to Seva.
Then I realized that what I was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit -- that I felt good about myself.
Then I started to think about the people in the Himalayas whose cataracts would be helped, and I realized that I went from this kind of narcissistic self-focus to altruistic joy, to feeling good for the people that were being helped. I think that's a motivator.
But this distinction between focusing on ourselves and focusing on others is one that I encourage us all to pay attention to.
You can see it at a gross level in the world of dating.
I was at a sushi restaurant a while back and I overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman, who was in the singles scene. And this woman says, "My brother is having trouble getting dates, so he's trying speed dating." I don't know if you know speed dating?
Women sit at tables and men go from table to table, and there's a clock and a bell, and at five minutes, bingo, the conversation ends and the woman can decide whether to give her card or her email address to the man for follow up. And this woman says, "My brother's never gotten a card, and I know exactly why.
The moment he sits down, he starts talking non-stop about himself; he never asks about the woman."
And I was doing some research in the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, looking at the back stories of marriages -- because they're very interesting -- and I came to the marriage of Alice Charney Epstein. And she said that when she was in the dating scene, she had a simple test she put people to.
The test was: from the moment they got together, how long it would take the guy to ask her a question with the word "you" in it.
And apparently Epstein aced the test, therefore the article.
Now this is a -- it's a little test I encourage you to try out at a party.
Here at TED there are great opportunities.
The Harvard Business Review recently had an article called "The Human Moment," about how to make real contact with a person at work. And they said, well, the fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your BlackBerry, close your laptop, end your daydream and pay full attention to the person.
There is a newly coined word in the English language for the moment when the person we're with whips out their BlackBerry or answers that cell phone, and all of a sudden we don't exist.
The word is "pizzled": it's a combination of puzzled and pissed off.
I think it's quite apt. It's our empathy, it's our tuning in which separates us from Machiavellians or sociopaths.
I have a brother-in-law who's an expert on horror and terror -- he wrote the Annotated Dracula, the Essential Frankenstein -- he was trained as a Chaucer scholar, but he was born in Transylvania and I think it affected him a little bit.
At any rate, at one point my brother-in-law, Leonard, decided to write a book about a serial killer.
This is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we're in many years ago. He was known as the Santa Cruz strangler.
And before he was arrested, he had murdered his grandparents, his mother and five co-eds at UC Santa Cruz.
So my brother-in-law goes to interview this killer and he realizes when he meets him that this guy is absolutely terrifying.
For one thing, he's almost seven feet tall.
But that's not the most terrifying thing about him.
The scariest thing is that his IQ is 160: a certified genius.
But there is zero correlation between IQ and emotional empathy, feeling with the other person.
They're controlled by different parts of the brain.
So at one point, my brother-in-law gets up the courage to ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to, and that is: how could you have done it?
Didn't you feel any pity for your victims?
These were very intimate murders -- he strangled his victims.
And the strangler says very matter-of-factly, "Oh no. If I'd felt the distress, I could not have done it.
I had to turn that part of me off. I had to turn that part of me off."
And I think that that is very troubling, and in a sense, I've been reflecting on turning that part of us off.
When we focus on ourselves in any activity, we do turn that part of ourselves off if there's another person.
Think about going shopping and think about the possibilities of a compassionate consumerism.
Right now, as Bill McDonough has pointed out, the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences.
We're all unwitting victims of a collective blind spot.
We don't notice and don't notice that we don't notice the toxic molecules emitted by a carpet or by the fabric on the seats.
Or we don't know if that fabric is a technological or manufacturing nutrient; it can be reused or does it just end up at landfill? In other words, we're oblivious to the ecological and public health and social and economic justice consequences of the things we buy and use.
In a sense, the room itself is the elephant in the room, but we don't see it. And we've become victims of a system that points us elsewhere. Consider this.
There's a wonderful book called Stuff: The Hidden Life of Everyday Objects.
And it talks about the back story of something like a t-shirt.
And it talks about where the cotton was grown and the fertilizers that were used and the consequences for soil of that fertilizer. And it mentions, for instance, that cotton is very resistant to textile dye; about 60 percent washes off into wastewater.
And it's well known by epidemiologists that kids who live near textile works tend to have high rates of leukemia.
There's a company, Bennett and Company, that supplies Polo.com, Victoria's Secret -- they, because of their CEO, who's aware of this, in China formed a joint venture with their dye works to make sure that the wastewater would be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater.
Right now, we don't have the option to choose the virtuous t-shirt over the non-virtuous one. So what would it take to do that?
Well, I've been thinking. For one thing, there's a new electronic tagging technology that allows any store to know the entire history of any item on the shelves in that store.
You can track it back to the factory. Once you can track it back to the factory, you can look at the manufacturing processes that were used to make it, and if it's virtuous, you can label it that way. Or if it's not so virtuous, you can go into -- today, go into any store, put your scanner on a palm onto a barcode, which will take you to a website.
They have it for people with allergies to peanuts.
That website could tell you things about that object.
In other words, at point of purchase, we might be able to make a compassionate choice.
There's a saying in the world of information science: ultimately everybody will know everything.
And the question is: will it make a difference?
Some time ago when I was working for The New York Times, it was in the '80s, I did an article on what was then a new problem in New York -- it was homeless people on the streets.
And I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless. And I realized seeing the homeless through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go. They had a diagnosis. It made me -- what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where, when we see, when we're passing someone who's homeless in the periphery of our vision, it stays on the periphery.
We don't notice and therefore we don't act.
One day soon after that -- it was a Friday -- at the end of the day, I went down -- I was going down to the subway. It was rush hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs.
And all of a sudden as I was going down the stairs I noticed that there was a man slumped to the side, shirtless, not moving, and people were just stepping over him -- hundreds and hundreds of people.
And because my urban trance had been somehow weakened, I found myself stopping to find out what was wrong.
The moment I stopped, half a dozen other people immediately ringed the same guy.
And we found out that he was Hispanic, he didn't speak any English, he had no money, he'd been wandering the streets for days, starving, and he'd fainted from hunger.
Immediately someone went to get orange juice, someone brought a hotdog, someone brought a subway cop.
This guy was back on his feet immediately.
But all it took was that simple act of noticing, and so I'm optimistic.
Thank you very much.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/ananda_shankar_jayant_fights_cancer_with_a_dance.html</url>
[Sanskrit] This is an ode to the mother goddess, that most of us in India learn when we are children.
I learned it when I was four at my mother's knee.
That year she introduced me to dance, and thus began my tryst with classical dance.
Since then -- it's been four decades now -- I've trained with the best in the field, performed across the globe, taught young and old alike, created, collaborated, choreographed, and wove a rich tapestry of artistry, achievement and awards.
The crowning glory was in 2007, when I received this country's fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri, for my contribution to art.
But nothing, nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July 2008.
I heard the word "carcinoma."
Yes, breast cancer.
As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office, I heard other words: "cancer," "stage," "grade."
Until then, Cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend, stage was what I performed on, and grades were what I got in school.
That day, I realized I had an unwelcome, uninvited, new life partner.
As a dancer, I know the nine rasas or the navarasas: anger, valor, disgust, humor and fear.
I thought I knew what fear was.
That day, I learned what fear was.
Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control, I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband, Jayant.
I said, "Is this it? Is this the end of the road?
Is this the end of my dance?"
And he, the positive soul that he is, said, "No, this is just a hiatus, a hiatus during the treatment, and you'll get back to doing what you do best."
I realized then that I, who thought I had complete control of my life, had control of only three things: My thought, my mind -- the images that these thoughts created -- and the action that derived from it.
So here I was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you, with the enormity of the situation, wanting to go to a place of healing, health and happiness.
I wanted to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, for which I needed something.
I needed something that would pull me out of all this.
So I dried my tears, and I declared to the world at large ...
I said, "Cancer's only one page in my life, and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life."
I also declared to the world at large that I would ride it out, and I would not allow cancer to ride me.
But to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, I needed something.
I needed an anchor, an image, a peg to peg this process on, so that I could go from there.
And I found that in my dance, my dance, my strength, my energy, my passion, my very life breath.
But it wasn't easy.
Believe me, it definitely wasn't easy.
How do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days?
How do you not despair when, with the body ravaged by chemotherapy, climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture, that to someone like me who could dance for three hours?
How do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all?
All I wanted to do was curl up and weep.
But I kept telling myself fear and tears are options I did not have.
So I would drag myself into my dance studio -- body, mind and spirit -- every day into my dance studio, and learn everything I learned when I was four, all over again, reworked, relearned, regrouped.
It was excruciatingly painful, but I did it.
Difficult.
I focused on my mudras, on the imagery of my dance, on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself.
And slowly, I moved out of that miserable state of mind.
But I needed something else.
I needed something to go that extra mile, and I found it in that metaphor which I had learned from my mother when I was four.
The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini, of Durga.
Durga, the mother goddess, the fearless one, created by the pantheon of Hindu gods.
Durga, resplendent, bedecked, beautiful, her 18 arms ready for warfare, as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur.
Durga, the epitome of creative feminine energy, or shakti.
Durga, the fearless one.
I made that image of Durga and her every attribute, her every nuance, my very own.
Powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training, I brought laser-sharp focus into my dance, laser-sharp focus to such an extent that I danced a few weeks after surgery.
I danced through chemo and radiation cycles, much to the dismay of my oncologist.
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule.
What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance.
Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life.
My story is a story of overcoming setbacks, obstacles and challenges that life throws at you.
My story is the power of thought.
My story is the power of choice.
It's the power of focus.
It's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you, so moves you, that something even like cancer becomes insignificant.
My story is the power of a metaphor.
It's the power of an image.
Mine was that of Durga, Durga the fearless one.
She was also called Simhanandini, the one who rode the lion.
As I ride out, as I ride my own inner strength, my own inner resilience, armed as I am with what medication can provide and continue treatment, as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer, asking my rogue cells to behave, I want to be known not as a cancer survivor, but as a cancer conqueror.
I present to you an excerpt of that work "Simhanandini."

Time flies.
It's actually almost 20 years ago when I wanted to reframe the way we use information, the way we work together: I invented the World Wide Web.
Now, 20 years on, at TED, I want to ask your help in a new reframing.
So going back to 1989, I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system.
Nobody really did anything with it, pretty much.
But 18 months later -- this is how innovation happens -- 18 months later, my boss said I could do it on the side, as a sort of a play project, kick the tires of a new computer we'd got.
And so he gave me the time to code it up.
So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like: hypertext protocol, HTTP; the idea of URLs, these names for things which started with HTTP.
I wrote the code and put it out there.
Why did I do it?
Well, it was basically frustration.
I was frustrated -- I was working as a software engineer in this huge, very exciting lab, lots of people coming from all over the world.
They brought all sorts of different computers with them.
They had all sorts of different data formats, all sorts, all kinds of documentation systems.
So that, in all that diversity, if I wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this, everything I looked into, I had to connect to some new machine, I had to learn to run some new program, I would find the information I wanted in some new data format.
And these were all incompatible.
It was just very frustrating.
The frustration was all this unlocked potential.
In fact, on all these discs there were documents.
So if you just imagined them all being part of some big, virtual documentation system in the sky, say on the Internet, then life would be so much easier.
Well, once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin and even if people don't read your memo -- actually he did, it was found after he died, his copy.
He had written, "Vague, but exciting," in pencil, in the corner.
But in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain what the web was like.
It's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then.
But then -- OK, when TED started, there was no web so things like "click" didn't have the same meaning.
I can show somebody a piece of hypertext, a page which has got links, and we click on the link and bing -- there'll be another hypertext page.
Not impressive.
You know, we've seen that -- we've got things on hypertext on CD-ROMs.
What was difficult was to get them to imagine: so, imagine that that link could have gone to virtually any document you could imagine.
Alright, that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make.
Well, some people did.
So yeah, it was difficult to explain, but there was a grassroots movement.
And that is what has made it most fun.
That has been the most exciting thing, not the technology, not the things people have done with it, but actually the community, the spirit of all these people getting together, sending the emails.
That's what it was like then.
Do you know what? It's funny, but right now it's kind of like that again.
I asked everybody, more or less, to put their documents -- I said, "Could you put your documents on this web thing?"
And you did.
Thanks.
It's been a blast, hasn't it?
I mean, it has been quite interesting because we've found out that the things that happen with the web really sort of blow us away.
They're much more than we'd originally imagined when we put together the little, initial website that we started off with.
Now, I want you to put your data on the web.
Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential.
There is still a huge frustration that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data.
What do you mean, "data"? What's the difference -- documents, data?
Well, documents you read, OK?
More or less, you read them, you can follow links from them, and that's it.
Data -- you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer.
Who was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk?
One of the great -- yes a lot of people have seen it -- one of the great TED Talks.
Hans put up this presentation in which he showed, for various different countries, in various different colors -- he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality, and he shot this thing animated through time.
So, he'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world.
He put up a slide a little bit like this.
It had underground all the data OK, data is brown and boxy and boring, and that's how we think of it, isn't it?
Because data you can't naturally use by itself But in fact, data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it.
In this case, Hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things.
He had put it together, combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he'd put it into this software, which I think his son developed, originally, and produces this wonderful presentation.
And Hans made a point of saying, "Look, it's really important to have a lot of data."
And I was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying, very forcibly, "It's really important to have a lot of data."
So I want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected, or six like he did, but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web and then calling that linked data.
The technology is linked data, and it's extremely simple.
If you want to put something on the web there are three rules: first thing is that those HTTP names -- those things that start with "http:" -- we're using them not just for documents now, we're using them for things that the documents are about.
We're using them for people, we're using them for places, we're using them for your products, we're using them for events.
All kinds of conceptual things, they have names now that start with HTTP.
Second rule, if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data using the HTTP protocol from the web, I will get back some data in a standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know about that thing, about that event.
Who's at the event? Whatever it is about that person, where they were born, things like that.
So the second rule is I get important information back.
Third rule is that when I get back that information it's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born, it's got relationships.
Data is relationships.
Interestingly, data is relationships.
This person was born in Berlin; Berlin is in Germany.
And when it has relationships, whenever it expresses a relationship then the other thing that it's related to is given one of those names that starts HTTP.
So, I can go ahead and look that thing up.
So I look up a person -- I can look up then the city where they were born; then I can look up the region it's in, and the town it's in, and the population of it, and so on.
So I can browse this stuff.
So that's it, really.
That is linked data.
I wrote an article entitled "Linked Data" a couple of years ago and soon after that, things started to happen.
The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots of these boxes that Hans had, and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting.
It's not just a whole lot of other plants.
It's not just a root supplying a plant, but for each of those plants, whatever it is -- a presentation, an analysis, somebody's looking for patterns in the data -- they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together, and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is.
So, linked data.
The meme went out there.
And, pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin who was one of the first people to put interesting things up, he noticed that Wikipedia -- you know Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia with lots and lots of interesting documents in it.
Well, in those documents, there are little squares, little boxes.
And in most information boxes, there's data.
So he wrote a program to take the data, extract it from Wikipedia, and put it into a blob of linked data on the web, which he called dbpedia.
Dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide and if you actually go and look up Berlin, you'll find that there are other blobs of data which also have stuff about Berlin, and they're linked together.
So if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin, you'll end up pulling up these other things as well.
And the exciting thing is it's starting to grow.
This is just the grassroots stuff again, OK?
Let's think about data for a bit.
Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms.
Think of the diversity of the web. It's a really important thing that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there.
So it is with data. I could talk about all kinds of data.
We could talk about government data, enterprise data is really important, there's scientific data, there's personal data, there's weather data, there's data about events, there's data about talks, and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff.
I'm just going to mention a few of them so that you get the idea of the diversity of it, so that you also see how much unlocked potential.
Let's start with government data.
Barack Obama said in a speech, that he -- American government data would be available on the Internet in accessible formats.
And I hope that they will put it up as linked data.
That's important. Why is it important?
Not just for transparency, yeah transparency in government is important, but that data -- this is the data from all the government departments Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America.
It's actual useful. It's got value.
I can use it in my company.
I could use it as a kid to do my homework.
So we're talking about making the place, making the world run better by making this data available.
In fact if you're responsible -- if you know about some data in a government department, often you find that these people, they're very tempted to keep it -- Hans calls it database hugging.
You hug your database, you don't want to let it go until you've made a beautiful website for it.
Well, I'd like to suggest that rather -- yes, make a beautiful website, who am I to say don't make a beautiful website?
Make a beautiful website, but first give us the unadulterated data, we want the data.
We want unadulterated data.
OK, we have to ask for raw data now.
And I'm going to ask you to practice that, OK?
Can you say "raw"?
Audience: Raw.
Tim Berners-Lee: Can you say "data"?
Audience: Data.
TBL: Can you say "now"?
Audience: Now!
TBL: Alright, "raw data now"!
Audience: Raw data now!
Practice that. It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses people come up with to hang onto their data and not give it to you, even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer.
And it's not just America. It's all over the world.
And it's not just governments, of course -- it's enterprises as well.
So I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data.
Here we are at TED, and all the time we are very conscious of the huge challenges that human society has right now -- curing cancer, understanding the brain for Alzheimer's, understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable, understanding how the world works.
The people who are going to solve those -- the scientists -- they have half-formed ideas in their head, they try to communicate those over the web.
But a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment is on databases, often sitting in their computers, and actually, currently not shared.
In fact, I'll just go into one area -- if you're looking at Alzheimer's, for example, drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos, because they had their genomics data in one database in one building, and they had their protein data in another.
Now, they are sticking it onto -- linked data -- and now they can ask the sort of question, that you probably wouldn't ask, I wouldn't ask -- they would.
What proteins are involved in signal transduction and also related to pyramidal neurons?
Well, you take that mouthful and you put it into Google.
Of course, there's no page on the web which has answered that question because nobody has asked that question before.
You get 223,000 hits -- no results you can use.
You ask the linked data -- which they've now put together -- 32 hits, each of which is a protein which has those properties and you can look at.
The power of being able to ask those questions, as a scientist -- questions which actually bridge across different disciplines -- is really a complete sea change.
It's very very important.
Scientists are totally stymied at the moment -- the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems.
Now if I go on like this, you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you.
But, that's not true.
In fact, data is about our lives.
You just -- you log on to your social networking site, your favorite one, you say, "This is my friend."
Bing! Relationship. Data.
You say, "This photograph, it's about -- it depicts this person. " Bing! That's data. Data, data, data.
Every time you do things on the social networking site, the social networking site is taking data and using it -- re-purposing it -- and using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site.
But, when you go to another linked data site -- and let's say this is one about travel, and you say, "I want to send this photo to all the people in that group," you can't get over the walls.
The Economist wrote an article about it, and lots of people have blogged about it -- tremendous frustration.
The way to break down the silos is to get inter-operability between social networking sites.
We need to do that with linked data.
One last type of data I'll talk about, maybe it's the most exciting.
Before I came down here, I looked it up on OpenStreetMap The OpenStreetMap's a map, but it's also a Wiki.
Zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we're in right now -- The Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it.
So I could go into edit mode, I could select the theater, I could add down at the bottom the name, and I could save it back.
And now if you go back to the OpenStreetMap. org, and you find this place, you will find that The Terrace Theater has got a name.
I did that. Me!
I did that to the map. I just did that!
I put that up on there. Hey, you know what?
If I -- that street map is all about everybody doing their bit and it creates an incredible resource because everybody else does theirs.
And that is what linked data is all about.
It's about people doing their bit to produce a little bit, and it all connecting.
That's how linked data works.
You do your bit. Everybody else does theirs.
You may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it.
And we've practiced that.
So, linked data -- it's huge.
I've only told you a very small number of things There are data in every aspect of our lives, every aspect of work and pleasure, and it's not just about the number of places where data comes, it's about connecting it together.
And when you connect data together, you get power in a way that doesn't happen just with the web, with documents.
You get this really huge power out of it.
So, we're at the stage now where we have to do this -- the people who think it's a great idea.
And all the people -- and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because -- even though there's not an immediate return on the investment because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it -- they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things which would be good if everybody else did them.
OK, so it's called linked data.
I want you to make it.
I want you to demand it.
And I think it's an idea worth spreading.
Thanks.

So let me start by taking you back, back into the mists of your memory to perhaps the most anticipated year in your life, but certainly the most anticipated year in all human history: the year 2000. Remember that?
Y2K, the dotcom bubble, stressing about whose party you're going to go to as the clock strikes midnight, before the champagne goes flat, and then there's that inchoate yearning that was felt, I think, by many, that the millennium, that the year 2000, should mean more, more than just a two and some zeroes.
Well, amazingly, for once, our world leaders actually lived up to that millennium moment and back in 2000 agreed to some pretty extraordinary stuff: visionary, measurable, long-term targets called the Millennium Development Goals.
Now, I'm sure you all keep a copy of the goals under your pillow, or by the bedside table, but just in case you don't, and your memory needs some jogging, the deal agreed then goes like this: developing countries promised to at least halve extreme poverty, hunger and deaths from disease, alongside some other targets, by 2015, and developed nations promised to help them get that done by dropping debts, increasing smart aid, and trade reform.
Well, we're approaching 2015, so we'd better assess, how are we doing on these goals?
But we've also got to decide, do we like such global goals?
Some people don't. And if we like them, we've got to decide what we want to do on these goals going forward.
What does the world want to do together?
We've got to decide a process by which we decide.
Well, I definitely think these goals are worth building on and seeing through, and here's just a few reasons why.
Incredible partnerships between the private sector, political leaders, philanthropists and amazing grassroots activists across the developing world, but also 250,000 people marched in the streets of Edinburgh outside this very building for Make Poverty History.
All together, they achieved these results: increased the number of people on anti-retrovirals, life-saving anti-AIDS drugs; nearly halved deaths from malaria; vaccinated so many that 5.4 million lives will be saved.
And combined, this is going to result in two million fewer children dying every year, last year, than in the year 2000.
That's 5,000 fewer kids dying every day, ten times you lot not dead every day, because of all of these partnerships.
So I think this is amazing living proof of progress that more people should know about, but the challenge of communicating this kind of good news is probably the subject of a different TEDTalk.
Anyway, for now, anyone involved in getting these results, thank you. I think this proved these goals are worth it.
But there's still a lot of unfinished business.
Still, 7.6 million children die every year of preventable, treatable diseases, and 178 million kids are malnourished to the point of stunting, a horrible term which means physical and cognitive lifelong impairment.
So there's plainly a lot more to do on the goals we've got.
But then, a lot of people think there are things that should have been in the original package that weren't agreed back then that should now be included, like sustainable development targets, natural resource governance targets, access to opportunity, to knowledge, equity, fighting corruption.
All of this is measurable and could be in the new goals.
But the key thing here is, what do you think should be in the new goals?
What do you want?
Are you annoyed that I didn't talk about gender equality or education?
Should those be in the new package of goals?
And quite frankly, that's a good question, but there's going to be some tough tradeoffs and choices here, so you want to hope that the process by which the world decides these new goals is going to be legitimate, right?
Well, as we gather here in Edinburgh, technocrats appointed by the U.N. and certain governments, with the best intentions, are busying themselves designing a new package of goals, and currently they're doing that through pretty much the same old late-20th-century, top-down, elite, closed process.
But, of course, since then, the Web and mobile telephony, along with ubiquitous reality TV formats have spread all around the world.
So what we'd like to propose is that we use them to involve people from all around the world in an historic first: the world's first truly global poll and consultation, where everyone everywhere has an equal voice for the very first time.
I mean, wouldn't it be a huge historic missed opportunity not to do this, given that we can?
There's hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake, tens of millions of lives, or deaths, at stake, and, I'd argue, the security and future of you and your family is also at stake.
So, if you're with me, I'd say there's three essential steps in this crowdsourcing campaign: collecting, connecting and committing.
So first of all, we've got to ground this campaign in core polling data.
Let's go into every country that will let us in, ask 1,001 people what they want the new goals to be, making special efforts to reach the poorest, those without access to modern technology, and let's make sure that their views are at the center of the goals going forward.
Then, we've got to commission a baseline survey to make sure we can monitor and progress the goals going forward. The original goals didn't really have good baseline survey data, and we're going to need the help of big data through all of this process to make sure we can really monitor the progress.
And then we've got to connect with the big crowd.
Now here, we see the role for an unprecedented coalition of social media giants and upstarts, telecoms companies, reality TV show formats, gaming companies, telecoms, all of them together in kind of their "We Are The World" moment.
Could they come together and help the Millennium Development Goals get rebranded into the Millennial Generation's Goals?
And if just five percent of the five billion plus who are currently connected made a comment, and that comment turned into a commitment, we could crowdsource a force of 300 million people around the world to help see these goals through.
If we have this collected data, and this connected crowd, based upon our experience of campaigning and getting world leaders to commit, I think world leaders will commit to most of the crowdsourced recommendations.
But the question really is, through this process will we all have become committed?
And if we are, are we ready to iterate, monitor and provide feedback, make sure these promises are really delivering results?
Well, there's some fantastic examples here to scale up, mostly piloted within Africa, actually.
There's Open Data Kenya, which geocodes and crowdsources information about where projects are, are they delivering results.
Often, they're not in the right place.
And Ushahidi, which means "witness" in Swahili, which geocodes and crowdsources information in complex emergencies to help target responses.
This is some of the most exciting stuff in development and democracy, where citizens on the edge of a network are helping to force open the process to make sure that the big global aid promises and vague stuff up at the top really delivers for people at a grassroots level and inverts that pyramid.
This openness, this forcing openness, is key, and if it wasn't entirely transparent already, I should be open: I've got a completely transparent agenda.
Long-term trends suggest that this century is going to be a tough place to live, with population increases, consumption patterns increasing, and conflict over scarce natural resources.
And look at the state of global politics today.
Look at the Rio Earth Summit that happened just last week, or the Mexican G20, also last week.
Both, if we're honest, a bust.
Our world leaders, our global politics, currently can't get it done.
They need our help. They need the cavalry, and the cavalry's not going to come from Mars.
It's got to come from us, and I see this process of deciding democratically in a bottom-up fashion what the world wants to work on together as one vital means by which we can crowdsource the force to really build that constituency that's going to reinvigorate global governance in the 21st century.
I started in 2000. Let me finish in 2030.
Many people made fun of a big campaign a few years ago we had called Make Poverty History.
It was a naive thought in many people's minds, and it's true, it was just a t-shirt slogan that worked for the moment. But look.
The empirical condition of living under a dollar and 25 is trending down, and look where it gets to by 2030.
It's getting near zero.
Now sure, progress in China and India and poverty reduction there was key to that, but recently also in Africa, poverty rates are being reduced.
It will get harder as we get towards zero, as the poor will be increasingly located in post-conflict, fragile states, or maybe in middle income states where they don't really care about the marginalized.
But I'm confident, with the right kind of political campaigning and creative and technological innovation combined working together more and more as one, I think we can get this and other goals done.
Thank you.
Jamie, here's the puzzle to me.
If there was an incident today where a hundred kids died in some tragedy or where, say, a hundred kids were kidnapped and then rescued by special forces, I mean, it would be all over the news for a week, right?
You just put up, just as one of your numbers there, that 5,000 -- is that the number?
Jamie Drummond: Fewer children every day.
Five thousand fewer children dying every day.
I mean, it dwarfs, dwarfs everything that is actually on our news agenda, and it's invisible.
This must drive you crazy.
JD: It does, and we're having a huge debate in this country about aid levels, for example, and aid alone is not the whole solution. Nobody thinks it is.
But, you know, if people saw the results of this smart aid, I mean, they'd be going crazy for it.
I wish the 250,000 people who really did march outside this very building knew these results.
Right now they don't, and it would be great to find a way to better communicate it, because we have not.
Creatively, we've failed to communicate this success so far.
If those kinds of efforts just could multiply their voice and amplify it at the key moments, I know for a fact we'd get better policy.
The Mexican G20 need not have been a bust.
Rio, if anyone cares about the environment, need not have been a bust, okay?
But these conferences are going on, and I know people get skeptical and cynical about the big global summits and the promises and their never being kept, but actually, the bits that are, are making a difference, and what the politicians need is more permission from the public.
But you haven't fully worked out the Web mechanisms, etc.
by which this might happen.
I mean, if the people here who've had experience using open platforms, you're interested to talk with them this week and try to take this forward.
JD: Absolutely. All right, well I must say, if this conference led in some way to advancing that idea, that's a huge idea, and if you carry that forward, that is really awesome, so thank you. JD: I'd love your help.
Thank you, thank you.

<title>Jamie Drummond: Let's crowdsource the world's goals</title>
<description>In 2000, the UN laid out 8 goals to make the world better by reducing poverty and disease -- with a deadline of 2015. As that deadline approaches, Jamie Drummond of ONE.org runs down the surprising successes of the 8 Millennium Development Goals, and suggests a crowdsourced reboot for the next 15 years.</description>

The moment I say "school," so many memories come back to me.
It's like after every exam, when I walk out, the teacher would say, "Hey, come.
How did you do?"
I would say with a great smile, "I will definitely pass."
And I didn't understand why, in one hand they say, "Speak the truth," in the other hand, when you say the truth, they hated you.
So it went on like that, and I didn't know where else to find myself.
So I remember those nights I used to go to sleep with asking help from [the] Unknown because, for some reason, I couldn't believe what my father and mother hanged in the Puja room as a god, because my friend's family had something else as a god.
So I thought, "I guess I'll pray to [the] Unknown and ask help," and started getting help from everywhere, each and every corner of my life at that time.
My brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting.
Then, when I was in eighth standard around 13 years old, I started working in a part-time job in one of the signboard artists called Putu.
And then school also started supporting me.
"Oh, he's bad at studies, but let him send to the drawing competitions."
So it was good to survive with that little tool that I found to find my own place in school.
And one of those competitions, I just won a small, little transistor Philips radio.
And I didn't have the patience to wait until I reached home.
So I just switched on in the train, loudly.
If you travel in Indian trains, you can see people listening to radio and, you know, even from their mobiles.
So at that time -- and I was 13 -- and I was listening to just radio, and someone happened to sit next to me, like these three people are sitting here.
You know, like just adjacent to me.
He just started asking, "Where did you buy the radio? How much is it?"
I said, "It's a prize from [an] art competition."
And he said, "Oh, I teach at a college of arts.
I think you should study in a school of art.
You just quit school and come there."
So, why I'm telling you this, you know, maybe, you know, whoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life -- it's possible.
It is that we need we need to be open and fine-tuned.
So that's what made me enter [the] college of arts after three attempts and just continue to inquire what I really want to do with art work, or art and finally I'm here in front of you.
When I look back, you know, on what happened between that time and now here -- the last 10/15 years -- I can see that most of the works revolve around three subjects, but it was not intentional.
And I just start out with a trace because I was thinking, "What really makes us?" -- you know, it's actually [the] past, what makes a person.
So I was thinking, but when you look at the past, the way to understand the past is only by the traces available, because we cannot go back [to] the past.
It can be ruins, or it can be music, or it can be painting or drawing or writing, whatever it is.
But it is just a kind of trace of that time.
And that fascinated me, to explore that territory.
So I was working on the line, but instead of working about traces, I started capturing traces.
So here are some of the works I would like to show you.
So this is called "Self In Progress."
It's just a trace of being in this body.
So here, what happened then, you know -- what I really enjoyed the most is that this sculpture is nothing but a trace of myself.
It's almost like a 3D photograph.
So there is an element of performance, and there is an element of sculpture, and there is an element of feeling one's self, so close to one's self.
So it's almost like fossils for the future.
And then moved slowly to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces.
So this is what I was talking about, while molding, it's such a great experience, because we have freedom of like walking, or moving my hand or, moving around in the space, but the moment this becomes solid, when you cannot move even an inch, because this is plaster of Paris, so the moment you pour it it's like liquid; but after 20 minutes, it's almost like a hard stone.
So this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint because, knowingly or unknowingly, whatever we do, you know, we leave our traces here.
So I just thought, "I'm going to capture thumbprint, footprint, or whatever traces we leave as humans."
This is the trace of fire, this is the trace of sun.
Because when I was capturing traces, you know, this thought comes to me always: is it, only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace, or is there other ways to capture it?"
So this work is nothing but like -- because of the focal length of the lens, it just shows what is on the other side.
So I just put the paper on the focal length, which was an etching print, then I got the portrait of [the] sun from sunlight.
This is called "Dawn to Dawn."
What I did here, I just put like 10 feet [of] paper then put a coconut rope, and just burnt it.
So it took about 24 hours to get this line.
So wherever the fire is eating the paper, that's what becomes the work -- detail.
Even though we have traces when we try to understand them, the perception and context play a major role to understand it.
So do we really understand what it is, or are we trying to get what we think it is?
Then move towards questioning the perception because, even though there are traces, when you try to understand them, you know you play a major role.
So like let's say even a simple act.
How many of you saw a cow crossing in India while you were coming from Bangalore to Mysore?
Can you just raise the hand?
If you just ask an opinion of how, everyone can interpret it.
Like, let's say, if a schoolteacher says, she'll simply say, "To get to the other side."
Why the cow was crossing the road, you know.
The answer can be so different if Potter said it.
He would say, "For the greater good."
Martin Luther King would say, "I imagine a world where all cows will be free to cross the road, without having their motives called into question."
Imagine Moses comes now, and he sees the same cow walking around the street.
He would definitely say, "God came down from heaven, and he said unto the cow, 'Thou shalt cross the road.' And cow crossed the road, and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow."
Freud would say, "The fact that you're at all concerned reveals your underlying sexual insecurity."
If we ask Einstein, he would say, "Whether the cow crossed the road, or the road moved underneath the cow, depends on your frame of reference."
Or Buddha -- if he saw the same cow, he would say, "Asking this question denies your own nature [as a] cow."
So, what we see is just what we think often, and most of the time, we don't see what it is.
It just all depends on one's perception.
And context, what is really context?
You know, I could just show you this little piece of paper.
Because I always think meaning doesn't really exist.
The meaning of what we create in this world doesn't exist.
It's just created by the mind.
If you look at this piece of paper, this is the breadth and this is called length.
This is how we've been taught in school.
But if you tear it in the middle -- now, I didn't touch this breadth, but still, the meaning of this changes.
So what we conceive as a meaning is always not there; it's on the other side, even when we say dark, light, good, bad, tall, short -- all meaning it doesn't exist in reality.
It's just that being a human, the way we train to perceive the reality creates this meaning.
So this work from this period is mostly like -- you know, this is a work called "Light Makes Dark."
It's just captured through from the lamp.
So the lamp is not just giving a light, it's also giving a darkness.
So this is a work of art, which is just trying to explore that.
This is called "Limit Out."
This shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch -- do we really see?
This is an exact negative.
It's about six inches deep in the wall, but it just appears like it's coming out of the wall.
You know the wall is almost like -- this is the first skin, and this is the second, and there's a third, and each creates a meaning.
And we're just pulling the wall off the gallery.
Again, "Inward Out."
It's a full-figure cast from myself.
It's about eight inches deep.
When I was doing that, I always wondered since I've worked with creators -- and now you know, I've moved to questioning the perception -- whenever I see the bird flying in the sky, it just makes me feel like: is there anything behind, are there any traces up there, which as a human, we don't see them?
Is there any way to capture the thought into visual art?
I couldn't find it.
But a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about six, seven months, in the restroom, when I was changing the air freshener that goes from solid substance to vapor.
It's called Odonil.
This is the work I made out of that material.
The process to get to make the sculpture was interesting, because I wrote to Balsara, who produces that air freshener called Odonil, saying, "Dear Sir, I am an artist. This is my catalogue.
Will you help me to make this sculpture?"
They never wrote back to me.
Then I thought, "I will go to the Small Scale Industries Facilitating Unit and ask help."
So I told them, "I'd like to start an air freshener company."
They said, "Of course.
This is the fee for the project report, and we will give you all the details," and they gave.
Finally, I went back to them and said, "It's not for starting the company, it's just to make my own work.
Please come for the show."
And they did.
And this work is in the Devi Art Foundation in Delhi.
In India, nobody really talks about works of art; they always talk about the appreciation of art.
You buy this for 3,000 rupees, it'll become 30,000 in two months.
This is the craft that was going on, but there are a few collectors who also collect art which can depreciate.
And this was collected by Anapum -- which is like, finally in the end, he will not have anything, because it will evaporate.
So this is after a few weeks, this is after a few months.
It's just all about questioning the preconceptions.
So if someone says, "Oh, I see the portrait," it may not be the portrait after a few months.
And if they say it's solid, it will not be solid, it will evaporate.
And if they say they don't get it, that's also not true, because it's in the air.
It's in the same gallery or in the same museum.
So they inhaled it, but they are not aware of it.
While I was doing that work, my mom and my dad, they were looking at it and they said, "Why do you deal with negative subjects all the time?"
And I was like, "What do you mean?"
"Light makes dark and now evaporating self.
Don't you think it remained something about death," they said.
"Of course not. For me," I'm thinking, "this is tucked in some small solid, but the moment it evaporates, it's merged with the whole."
But she said, "No. Still, I don't like it.
Can you make something from nothing as a sculptor?"
I said, "No, mom. It can't be.
Because we can create a sculpture by gathering dust together, or we can break the sculpture and get the dust, but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe."
So, I did this work for her.
It's called "Emerging Angel."
This is the first day -- it just gives the appearance that one is becoming the other.
So, the same sculpture after a few days.
This is after 15/20 days.
Through that small little slit between the glass box and the wood, the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one.
This gave me a greater faith.
That evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith that maybe there is many more possibilities to capture [the] invisible.
So what you see now is called "Shadow Foreshadow."
And what I'd like to tell you is we don't see shadow, and we don't see light too; we see the source of the light.
We see where it's bouncing, but we don't see [them] as they exist.
You know, that's why the night sky, we see the sky as dark, but it's filled with light all the time.
When it's bounced on the moon, we see it.
The same thing in the darkroom.
The little dust particle will again, reflect the light, and we realize the existence of light.
So we don't see dark, we don't see light, we don't see gravity, we don't see electricity.
So, I just started doing this work to inquire further about how to sculpt the space between this object and there.
Because, as a visual artist, if I'm seeing this and I'm seeing that -- but how to sculpt this, you know?
If we sculpt this, this has two reference points.
The skin of this is also representing this.
And skin at the other end also represents the floor.
I did this as an experiment of casting the shadow.
So this is a corrugated box and its shadow.
Then the second one -- the moment you bring any invisible into the visible world it will have all the characteristics of the visible existence.
So that produced a shadow.
Then I thought, okay, let me sculpt that.
Then, again, that becomes an object.
Again, throwing light, then the third one.
So what you see is nothing but shadow of a shadow of a shadow.
And then again, at that point, there is no shadow.
I thought, "Oh, good. Work is finished."
You can see the detail.
This is called "Gravity."
It's called "Breath." It's just two holes on the gallery wall.
It's a false wall, which contains like 110 cubic feet.
So that hole actually makes the air come out and go in.
So where it's happening, we can see, but what is happening will remain invisible only.
This is from the show called "Invisible," at Talwar Gallery.
This is called "Kaayam."
Detail.
And what I'd like to tell you, our senses are so limited -- we cannot hear everything, we cannot see everything.
We don't feel, "I am touching the air," but if the breeze is a little more faster, then I can feel it.
So all of our construction of reality is through these limited senses.
So my recourse was like, is there any way to use all this as just a symbol or a sign?
And to really get to the point, we should move beyond, you know, go to the other side of the wall, like in logic, like are invisible.
Because when we see someone walks, we see the footprint.
But if we're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it, you will miss the point because the actual journey happens between those footprints, and the footprints are nothing but passing time.
Thank you.

I'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are, how globalized we aren't, and why it's important to actually be accurate in making those kinds of assessments.
And the leading point of view on this, whether measured by number of books sold, mentions in media, or surveys that I've run with groups ranging from my students to delegates to the World Trade Organization, is this view that national borders really don't matter very much anymore, cross-border integration is close to complete, and we live in one world.
And what's interesting about this view is, again, it's a view that's held by pro-globalizers like Tom Friedman, from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted, but it's also held by anti-globalizers, who see this giant globalization tsunami that's about to wreck all our lives if it hasn't already done so.
The other thing I would add is that this is not a new view.
I'm a little bit of an amateur historian, so I've spent some time going back, trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing. And the best, earliest quote that I could find was one from David Livingstone, writing in the 1850s about how the railroad, the steam ship, and the telegraph were integrating East Africa perfectly with the rest of the world.
Now clearly, David Livingstone was a little bit ahead of his time, but it does seem useful to ask ourselves, "Just how global are we?"
before we think about where we go from here.
So the best way I've found of trying to get people to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat, may not even be close to flat, is with some data.
So one of the things I've been doing over the last few years is really compiling data on things that could either happen within national borders or across national borders, and I've looked at the cross-border component as a percentage of the total.
I'm not going to present all the data that I have here today, but let me just give you a few data points.
I'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow, one kind of flow of people, one kind of flow of capital, and, of course, trade in products and services.
So let's start off with plain old telephone service.
Of all the voice-calling minutes in the world last year, what percentage do you think were accounted for by cross-border phone calls?
Pick a percentage in your own mind.
The answer turns out to be two percent.
If you include Internet telephony, you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent, but it's nowhere near what people tend to estimate.
Or let's turn to people moving across borders.
One particular thing we might look at, in terms of long-term flows of people, is what percentage of the world's population is accounted for by first-generation immigrants?
Again, please pick a percentage.
Turns out to be a little bit higher.
It's actually about three percent.
Or think of investment. Take all the real investment that went on in the world in 2010.
What percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment?
Not quite ten percent.
And then finally, the one statistic that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen: the export-to-GDP ratio.
If you look at the official statistics, they typically indicate a little bit above 30 percent.
However, there's a big problem with the official statistics, in that if, for instance, a Japanese component supplier ships something to China to be put into an iPod, and then the iPod gets shipped to the U.S., that component ends up getting counted multiple times.
So nobody knows how bad this bias with the official statistics actually is, so I thought I would ask the person who's spearheading the effort to generate data on this, Pascal Lamy, the Director of the World Trade Organization, what his best guess would be of exports as a percentage of GDP, without the double- and triple-counting, and it's actually probably a bit under 20 percent, rather than the 30 percent-plus numbers that we're talking about.
So it's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that I talk about in my book, "World 3.0," that we're very, very far from the no-border effect benchmark, which would imply internationalization levels of the order of 85, 90, 95 percent.
So clearly, apocalyptically-minded authors have overstated the case.
But it's not just the apocalyptics, as I think of them, who are prone to this kind of overstatement.
I've also spent some time surveying audiences in different parts of the world on what they actually guess these numbers to be.
Let me share with you the results of a survey that Harvard Business Review was kind enough to run of its readership as to what people's guesses along these dimensions actually were.
So a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide.
First of all, there is a suggestion of some error.
Okay.
Second, these are pretty large errors. For four quantities whose average value is less than 10 percent, you have people guessing three, four times that level.
Even though I'm an economist, I find that a pretty large error.
And third, this is not just confined to the readers of the Harvard Business Review.
I've run several dozen such surveys in different parts of the world, and in all cases except one, where a group actually underestimated the trade-to-GDP ratio, people have this tendency towards overestimation, and so I thought it important to give a name to this, and that's what I refer to as globaloney, the difference between the dark blue bars and the light gray bars.
Especially because, I suspect, some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims, I think it's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to globaloney.
A couple of different reasons come to mind.
First of all, there's a real dearth of data in the debate.
Let me give you an example. When I first published some of these data a few years ago in a magazine called Foreign Policy, one of the people who wrote in, not entirely in agreement, was Tom Friedman. And since my article was titled "Why the World Isn't Flat," that wasn't too surprising.
What was very surprising to me was Tom's critique, which was, "Ghemawat's data are narrow."
And this caused me to scratch my head, because as I went back through his several-hundred-page book, I couldn't find a single figure, chart, table, reference or footnote.
So my point is, I haven't presented a lot of data here to convince you that I'm right, but I would urge you to go away and look for your own data to try and actually assess whether some of these hand-me-down insights that we've been bombarded with actually are correct.
So dearth of data in the debate is one reason.
A second reason has to do with peer pressure.
I remember, I decided to write my "Why the World Isn't Flat" article, because I was being interviewed on TV in Mumbai, and the interviewer's first question to me was, "Professor Ghemawat, why do you still believe that the world is round?" And I started laughing, because I hadn't come across that formulation before.
And as I was laughing, I was thinking, I really need a more coherent response, especially on national TV. I'd better write something about this.
But what I can't quite capture for you was the pity and disbelief with which the interviewer asked her question.
The perspective was, here is this poor professor.
He's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years.
He really has no idea as to what's actually going on in the world.
So try this out with your friends and acquaintances, if you like. You'll find that it's very cool to talk about the world being one, etc.
If you raise questions about that formulation, you really are considered a bit of an antique.
And then the final reason, which I mention, especially to a TED audience, with some trepidation, has to do with what I call "techno-trances."
If you listen to techno music for long periods of time, it does things to your brainwave activity.
Something similar seems to happen with exaggerated conceptions of how technology is going to overpower in the very immediate run all cultural barriers, all political barriers, all geographic barriers, because at this point I know you aren't allowed to ask me questions, but when I get to this point in my lecture with my students, hands go up, and people ask me, "Yeah, but what about Facebook?"
And I got this question often enough that I thought I'd better do some research on Facebook.
Because, in some sense, it's the ideal kind of technology to think about. Theoretically, it makes it as easy to form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door.
What percentage of people's friends on Facebook are actually located in countries other than where people we're analyzing are based?
The answer is probably somewhere between 10 to 15 percent.
Non-negligible, so we don't live in an entirely local or national world, but very, very far from the 95 percent level that you would expect, and the reason's very simple.
We don't, or I hope we don't, form friendships at random on Facebook. The technology is overlaid on a pre-existing matrix of relationships that we have, and those relationships are what the technology doesn't quite displace. Those relationships are why we get far fewer than 95 percent of our friends being located in countries other than where we are.
So does all this matter? Or is globaloney just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to globalization-related issues?
I want to suggest that actually, globaloney can be very harmful to your health.
First of all, recognizing that the glass is only 10 to 20 percent full is critical to seeing that there might be potential for additional gains from additional integration, whereas if we thought we were already there, there would be no particular point to pushing harder.
It's a little bit like, we wouldn't be having a conference on radical openness if we already thought we were totally open to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about at this conference.
So being accurate about how limited globalization levels are is critical to even being able to notice that there might be room for something more, something that would contribute further to global welfare.
Which brings me to my second point.
Avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization.
So I actually spend most of my "World 3.0" book working through a litany of market failures and fears that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate.
I'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today, so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what I have in mind.
Think of France and the current debate about immigration.
When you ask people in France what percentage of the French population is immigrants, the answer is about 24 percent. That's their guess.
Maybe realizing that the number is just eight percent might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue.
Or to take an even more striking example, when the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations did a survey of Americans, asking them to guess what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid, the guess was 30 percent, which is slightly in excess of the actual level — — of U.S. governmental commitments to federal aid.
The reassuring thing about this particular survey was, when it was pointed out to people how far their estimates were from the actual data, some of them — not all of them — seemed to become more willing to consider increases in foreign aid.
So foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up here, because if you think about it, what I've been talking about today is this notion -- very uncontroversial amongst economists -- that most things are very home-biased.
"Foreign aid is the most aid to poor people," is about the most home-biased thing you can find.
If you look at the OECD countries and how much they spend per domestic poor person, and compare it with how much they spend per poor person in poor countries, the ratio — Branko Milanovic at the World Bank did the calculations — turns out to be about 30,000 to one.
Now of course, some of us, if we truly are cosmopolitan, would like to see that ratio being brought down to one-is-to-one.
I'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress from where we are.
If we simply brought that ratio down to 15,000 to one, we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the Rio Summit 20 years ago that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on.
So in summary, while radical openness is great, given how closed we are, even incremental openness could make things dramatically better. Thank you very much.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/marisa_fick_jordan_shares_the_wonder_of_zulu_wire_art.html</url>
The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years.
But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire.
Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses.
So, here you can see the change from use -- starting to use contemporary materials.
These pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s.
In the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form, which came from a squatter camp outside Durban.
And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point, and started developing, really, and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design.
And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year.
Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide, so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us, and not only to supply the materials on bobbins, but to produce to our color specifications.
At the same time, I was thinking, well, there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products, away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary.
So I developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range -- that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market.
We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes, forms. The scale became very important, and it's become our pet project. It's successful, it's been running for 12 years. And we supply the Conran shops, and Donna Karan, and so it's kind of great.
This is our group, our main group of weavers.
They come on a weekly basis to Durban.
They all have bank accounts.
They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from.
It's a weekly turnaround of production.
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of.
And that's also modernized today, and it's supporting work for 300 weavers.
And the rest says it all.
Thank you very much.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_cobley_what_physics_taught_me_about_marketing.html</url>
So I work in marketing, which I love, but my first passion was physics, a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher, when I had a little less gray hair.
So he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us.
And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing.
So quick show of hands -- who studied some marketing in university?
Who studied some physics in university?
Pretty good. And at school?
Okay, lots of you.
So, hopefully this will bring back some happy, or possibly some slightly disturbing memories.
So, physics and marketing.
We'll start with something very simple -- Newton's Law: "The force equals mass times acceleration."
This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign.
But if we rearrange this formula quickly, we can get to acceleration equals force over mass, which means that for a larger particle -- a larger mass -- it requires more force to change its direction.
It's the same with brands: the more massive a brand, the more baggage it has, the more force is needed to change its positioning.
And that's one of the reasons why Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture rather than try to persuade the world that Andersen's could stand for something other than accountancy.
It explains why Hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners, and why companies like Unilever and P&amp;G keep brands separate, like Ariel and Pringles and Dove rather than having one giant parent brand.
So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object the more force is needed to change its direction.
The marketing is, the bigger a brand, the more difficult it is to reposition it.
So think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures.
Now, who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?
Getting a little more technical now.
So this says that it's impossible, by definition, to measure exactly the state -- i.e., the position -- and the momentum of a particle, because the act of measuring it, by definition, changes it.
So to explain that -- if you've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it, then the photon of light has momentum, which knocks the particle, so you don't know where it was before you looked at it.
By measuring it, the act of measurement changes it.
The act of observation changes it.
It's the same in marketing.
So with the act of observing consumers, changes their behavior.
Think about the group of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group, and almost none of them buy lots of junk food.
And yet, McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year.
Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets, who stuff their trolleys full of fresh green vegetables and fruit, but don't shop like that any other day.
And if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for porn on the Web, it's very few.
Yet, at Google, we know it's the number-one searched for category.
So luckily, the science -- no, sorry -- the marketing is getting easier.
Luckily, with now better point-of-sale tracking, more digital media consumption, you can measure more what consumers actually do, rather than what they say they do.
So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle, because the observation changes it.
The marketing is -- the message for marketing is -- that try to measure what consumers actually do, rather than what they say they'll do or anticipate they'll do.
So next, the scientific method -- an axiom of physics, of all science -- says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation, you can only disprove it.
What this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning, and it will strengthen it, but it will not conclusively prove it.
And only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water.
So if we take an example -- Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the Earth.
It only took one robust observation from Copernicus to blow that idea out of the water.
And there are parallels for marketing -- you can invest for a long time in a brand, but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers' belief.
Take BP -- they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand, but then one little accident.
Think about Toyota.
It was, for a long time, revered as the most reliable of cars, and then they had the big recall incident.
And Tiger Woods, for a long time, the perfect brand ambassador.
Well, you know the story.
So the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis, but it's easy to disprove it -- any hypothesis is shaky.
And the marketing is that not matter how much you've invested in your brand, one bad week can undermine decades of good work.
So be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups that can undermine your brand.
And lastly, to the slightly obscure world of entropy -- the second law of thermodynamics.
This says that entropy, which is a measure of the disorder of a system, will always increase.
The same is true of marketing.
If we go back 20 years, the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand.
But where we are today, things have changed.
You can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the Conservative Party did earlier this year with their election poster.
But then you lose control of it.
With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer, it's impossible to control where it goes.
Your brand starts being dispersed, it gets more chaotic.
It's out of your control.
I actually saw him speak -- he did a good job.
But while this may be unsettling for marketers, it's actually a good thing.
This distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people, more in with the people.
It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force, which is ultimately good for your brand.
So, the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase; it's a fundamental law.
The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed.
You can't fight it, so embrace it and find a way to work with it.
So to close, my teacher, Mr. Vutter, told me that physics is cool, and hopefully, I've convinced you that physics can teach all of us, even in the world of marketing, something special.
Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/caroline_phillips_hurdy_gurdy_for_beginners.html</url>
Now, since this is TEDGlobal, who can tell me what this is called in French?
I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy -- "vielle à roue."
And in Spanish, "zanfona."
And in Italian, "ghironda," okay?
Hurdy-gurdy, or wheel fiddle.
So, these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy.
The hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel to rub strings, like the bow of a violin, to produce music.
It has three different kinds of strings.
The first string is the drone string, which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe.
The second string is a melody string, which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano.
And the third string is pretty innovative.
It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique.
It activates what's called the buzzing bridge, or the dog.
When I turn the crank and I apply pressure, it makes a sound like a barking dog.
So all of this is pretty innovative, if you consider that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play it; one to turn the crank, and another person -- yes -- to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs.
Luckily, all of this changed a couple of centuries later.
So, one person could actually play and almost -- this is pretty heavy -- carry the hurdy-gurdy.
The hurdy-gurdy has been used, historically, through the centuries in mostly dance music because of the uniqueness of the melody combined with the acoustic boombox here.
And today, the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music -- traditional folk music, dance, contemporary and world music -- in the U.K., in France, in Spain and in Italy.
And this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [to order and receive it].
It's made by specialized luthiers, also in Europe.
And it's very difficult to tune.
So without further ado, would you like to hear it?
Caroline Phillips: I didn't hear you. Would you like to hear it?
CP: Okay.
There I go.
I'd like to sing in Basque, which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live, in the region in France and Spain.
[Basque] Thank you.
This is a song that I wrote based on traditional Basque rhythms.
And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel.
Thank you. Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/al_vernacchio_sex_needs_a_new_metaphor_here_s_one.html</url>
I'd like to talk to you today about a whole new way to think about sexual activity and sexuality education, by comparison.
If you talk to someone today in America about sexual activity, you'll find pretty soon you're not just talking about sexual activity.
You're also talking about baseball.
Because baseball is the dominant cultural metaphor that Americans use to think about and talk about sexual activity, and we know that because there's all this language in English that seems to be talking about baseball but that's really talking about sexual activity.
So, for example, you can be a pitcher or a catcher, and that corresponds to whether you perform a sexual act or receive a sexual act.
Of course, there are the bases, which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order, ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run, which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm, at least for the guy.
You can strike out, which means you don't get to have any sexual activity.
And if you're a benchwarmer, you might be a virgin or somebody who for whatever reason isn't in the game, maybe because of your age or because of your ability or because of your skillset.
A bat's a penis, and a nappy dugout is a vulva, or a vagina.
A glove or a catcher's mitt is a condom.
A switch-hitter is a bisexual person, and we gay and lesbian folks play for the other team.
And then there's this one: "if there's grass on the field, play ball."
And that usually refers to if a young person, specifically often a young woman, is old enough to have pubic hair, she's old enough to have sex with.
This baseball model is incredibly problematic.
It's sexist. It's heterosexist.
It's competitive. It's goal-directed.
And it can't result in healthy sexuality developing in young people or in adults.
So we need a new model.
I'm here today to offer you that new model.
And it's based on pizza.
Now pizza is something that is universally understood and that most people associate with a positive experience.
So let's do this.
Let's take baseball and pizza and compare it when talking about three aspects of sexual activity: the trigger for sexual activity, what happens during sexual activity, and the expected outcome of sexual activity.
So when do you play baseball?
You play baseball when it's baseball season and when there's a game on the schedule.
It's not exactly your choice.
So if it's prom night or a wedding night or at a party or if our parents aren't home, hey, it's just batter up.
Can you imagine saying to your coach, "Uh, I'm not really feeling it today, I think I'll sit this game out."
That's just not the way it happens.
And when you get together to play baseball, immediately you're with two opposing teams, one playing offense, one playing defense, somebody's trying to move deeper into the field.
That's usually a sign to the boy.
Somebody's trying to defend people moving into the field.
That's often given to the girl.
It's competitive.
We're not playing with each other.
We're playing against each other.
And when you show up to play baseball, nobody needs to talk about what we're going to do or how this baseball game might be good for us.
Everybody knows the rules.
You just take your position and play the game.
But when do you have pizza?
Well, you have pizza when you're hungry for pizza.
It starts with an internal sense, an internal desire, or a need.
"Huh. I could go for some pizza."
And because it's an internal desire, we actually have some sense of control over that.
I could decide that I'm hungry but know that it's not a great time to eat.
And then when we get together with someone for pizza, we're not competing with them, we're looking for an experience that both of us will share that's satisfying for both of us, and when you get together for pizza with somebody, what's the first thing you do?
You talk about it.
You talk about what you want.
You talk about what you like.
You may even negotiate it.
"How do you feel about pepperoni?"
"Not so much, I'm kind of a mushroom guy myself."
"Well, maybe we can go half and half."
And even if you've had pizza with somebody for a very long time, don't you still say things like, "Should we get the usual?"
"Or maybe something a little more adventurous?"
Okay, so when you're playing baseball, so if we talk about during sexual activity, when you're playing baseball, you're just supposed to round the bases in the proper order one at a time.
You can't hit the ball and run to right field.
That doesn't work.
And you also can't get to second base and say, "I like it here. I'm going to stay here."
No.
And also, of course, with baseball, there's, like, the specific equipment and a specific skill set.
Not everybody can play baseball. It's pretty exclusive.
Okay, but what about pizza?
When we're trying to figure out what's good for pizza, isn't it all about what's our pleasure?
There are a million different kinds of pizza.
There's a million different toppings.
There's a million different ways to eat pizza.
And none of them are wrong. They're different.
And in this case, difference is good, because that's going to increase the chance that we're having a satisfying experience.
And lastly, what's the expected outcome of baseball?
Well, in baseball, you play to win.
You score as many runs as you can.
There's always a winner in baseball, and that means there's always a loser in baseball.
But what about pizza?
Well, in pizza, we're not really -- there's no winning. How do you win pizza?
You don't. But you do look for, "Are we satisfied?"
And sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or on different days.
And we get to decide when we feel satisfied.
If we're still hungry, we might have some more.
If you eat too much, though, you just feel gross.
So what if we could take this pizza model and overlay it on top of sexuality education?
A lot of sexuality education that happens today is so influenced by the baseball model, and it sets up education that can't help but produce unhealthy sexuality in young people.
And those young people become older people.
But if we could create sexuality education that was more like pizza, we could create education that invites people to think about their own desires, to make deliberate decisions about what they want, to talk about it with their partners, and to ultimately look for not some external outcome but for what feels satisfying, and we get to decide that.
You may have noticed in the baseball and pizza comparison, under the baseball, it's all commands.
They're all exclamation points.
But under the pizza model, they're questions.
And who gets to answer those questions?
You do. I do.
So remember, when we're thinking about sexuality education and sexual activity, baseball, you're out.
Pizza is the way to think about healthy, satisfying sexual activity, and good, comprehensive sexuality education.
Thank you very much for your time.

<title>Al Vernacchio: Sex needs a new metaphor. Here's one ...</title>
<description>For some reason, says educator Al Vernacchio, the metaphors for talking about sex in the US all come from baseball -- scoring, getting to first base, etc. The problem is, this frames sex as a competition, with a winner and a loser. Instead, he suggests a new metaphor, one that's more about shared pleasure, discussion and agreement, fulfillment and enjoyment. Let's talk about … pizza.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/helen_fisher_tells_us_why_we_love_cheat.html</url>
I'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century, and perhaps in the next 10,000 years.
But I want to start with my work on romantic love, because that's my most recent work.
What I and my colleagues did was put 32 people, who were madly in love, into a functional MRI brain scanner.
17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted; and 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped.
And so I want to tell you about that first, and then go on into where I think love is going.
"What 'tis to love?" Shakespeare said.
I think our ancestors -- I think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago.
I started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was by looking at the last 45 years of research on -- just the psychological research -- and as it turns out, there's a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love.
The first thing that happens is what I call -- a person begins to take on what I call, "special meaning."
As a truck driver once said to me, he said, "The world had a new center, and that center was Mary Anne."
George Bernard Shaw said it a little differently.
He said, "Love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another."
And indeed, that's what we do.
And then you just focus on this person.
You can list what you don't like about them, but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do.
As Chaucer said, "Love is blind."
In trying to understand romantic love, I decided I would read poetry from all over the world, and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth-century China, because it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman.
It's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot -- their car is different from every other car in the parking lot.
Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party.
And in this case, a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat.
And it goes like this. It's by a guy called Yuan Chen: "I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat.
The night I brought you home, I watched you roll it out."
He became hooked on a sleeping mat, probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain, just like with you and me.
But anyway, not only does this person take on special meaning, you focus your attention on them.
You aggrandize them. But you have intense energy.
As one Polynesian said, he said, "I felt like jumping in the sky."
You're up all night. You're walking till dawn.
You feel intense elation when things are going well; mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly.
Real dependence on this person.
As one businessman in New York said to me, he said, "Anything she liked, I liked."
Simple. Romantic love is very simple.
You become extremely sexually possessive.
You know, if you're just sleeping with somebody casually, you don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else.
But the moment you fall in love, you become extremely sexually possessive of them.
I think that that is a Darwinian -- there's a Darwinian purpose to this.
The whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team.
But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving: an intense craving to be with a particular person, not just sexually, but emotionally.
You'd much rather -- it would be nice to go to bed with them, but you want them to call you on the telephone, to invite you out, etc., to tell you that they love you.
The other main characteristic is motivation.
The motor in your brain begins to crank, and you want this person.
And last but not least, it is an obsession.
When I put these people in the machine, before I put them in the MRI machine, I would ask them all kinds of questions.
But my most important question was always the same.
It was: "What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person?"
And indeed, they would say, "All day. All night. I can never stop thinking about him or her."
And then, the very last question I would ask them -- I would always have to work myself up to this question, because I am not a psychologist.
I don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation.
And my final question was always the same.
I would say, "Would you die for him or her?"
And, indeed, these people would say "Yes!"
as if I had asked them to pass the salt.
I was just staggered by it.
So we scanned their brains, looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph, with a distraction task in between.
So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state.
And we found activity in a lot of brain regions.
In fact, one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine.
And indeed, that's exactly what happens.
I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion.
In fact, I had always thought it was a series of emotions, from very high to very low.
But actually, it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind.
The kind of mind -- part of the mind -- when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate, when you want to win that promotion at work.
The motor of the brain. It's a drive.
And in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive.
You know, if you ask somebody to go to bed with you, and they say, "No, thank you," you certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression.
But certainly, around the world, people who are rejected in love will kill for it.
People live for love. They kill for love. They die for love.
They have songs, poems, novels, sculptures, paintings, myths, legends.
In over 175 societies, people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system.
I have come to think it's one of the most powerful brain systems on earth for both great joy and great sorrow.
And I've also come to think that it's one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction.
One is the sex drive: the craving for sexual gratification.
W.H. Auden called it an "intolerable neural itch," and indeed, that's what it is.
It keeps bothering you a little bit, like being hungry.
The second of these three brain systems is romantic love: that elation, obsession of early love.
And the third brain system is attachment: that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long-term partner.
And I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there, looking for a whole range of partners.
You know, you can feel it when you're just driving along in your car.
It can be focused on nobody.
I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time, thereby conserving mating time and energy.
And I think that attachment, the third brain system, evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being -- -- at least long enough to raise a child together as a team.
So with that preamble, I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends.
One of the last 10,000 years and the other, certainly of the last 25 years, that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems: lust, romantic love and deep attachment to a partner.
The first is women working, moving into the workforce.
I've looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations.
And everywhere in the world, 129 out of 130 of them, women are not only moving into the job market -- sometimes very, very slowly, but they are moving into the job market -- and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women in terms of economic power, health and education.
It's very slow.
For every trend on this planet, there's a counter-trend.
We all know of them, but nevertheless -- the Arabs say, "The dogs may bark, but the caravan moves on."
And, indeed, that caravan is moving on.
Women are moving back into the job market.
And I say back into the job market, because this is not new.
For millions of years, on the grasslands of Africa, women commuted to work to gather their vegetables.
They came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal.
The double income family was the standard.
And women were regarded as just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men.
In short, we're really moving forward to the past.
Then, women's worst invention was the plow.
With the beginning of plow agriculture, men's roles became extremely powerful.
Women lost their ancient jobs as collectors, but then with the industrial revolution and the post-industrial revolution they're moving back into the job market.
In short, they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago, 10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago.
We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal.
And it's going to have an impact.
I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community.
I'll only just say a couple of things, and then go on to sex and love.
There's a lot of gender differences; anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child.
I don't know why it is that they want to think that men and women are alike.
There's much we have in common, but there's a whole lot that we do not have in common.
We are -- in the words of Ted Hughes, "I think that we were built to be -- we're like two feet. We need each other to get ahead."
But we did not evolve to have the same brain.
And we're finding more and more and more gender differences in the brain.
I'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love.
One of them is women's verbal ability. Women can talk.
Women's ability to find the right word rapidly, basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen levels peak.
But even at menstruation, they're better than the average man.
Women can talk.
They've been doing it for a million years; words were women's tools.
They held that baby in front of their face, cajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words.
And, indeed, they're becoming a very powerful force.
Even in places like India and Japan, where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market, they're moving into journalism.
And I think that the television is like the global campfire.
We sit around it and it shapes our minds.
Almost always, when I'm on TV, the producers who call me, who negotiate what we're going to say, is a woman.
In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said, "To have a great writer is to have another government."
Today 54 percent of people who are writers in America are women.
It's one of many, many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market.
They've got incredible people skills, negotiating skills.
They're highly imaginative.
We now know the brain circuitry of imagination, of long-term planning.
They tend to be web thinkers.
Because the female parts of the brain are better connected, they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think, put them into more complex patterns, see more options and outcomes.
They tend to be contextual, holistic thinkers, what I call web thinkers.
Men tend to -- and these are averages -- tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous, focus on what they do, and move in a more step-by-step thinking pattern.
They're both perfectly good ways of thinking.
We need both of them to get ahead.
In fact, there's many more male geniuses in the world.
When the -- and there's also many more male idiots in the world.
When the male brain works well, it works extremely well.
And what I really think that we're doing is, we're moving towards a collaborative society, a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued and employed.
But in fact, women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life.
Foremost, women are starting to express their sexuality.
I'm always astonished when people come to me and say, "Why is it that men are so adulterous?"
And I say, "Why do you think more men are adulterous than women?"
"Oh, well -- men are more adulterous!"
And I say, "Who do you think these men are sleeping with?"
And -- basic math!
Anyway.
In the Western world, women start sooner at sex, have more partners, express less remorse for the partners that they do, marry later, have fewer children, leave bad marriages in order to get good ones.
We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression.
And, indeed, once again we're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago, because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today.
We're also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality.
They're now saying that the 21st century is going to be the century of what they call the "symmetrical marriage," or the "pure marriage," or the "companionate marriage."
This is a marriage between equals, moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit.
We're also seeing a rise of romantic love.
91 percent of American women and 86 percent of American men would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner, if they were not in love with that person.
People around the world, in a study of 37 societies, want to be in love with the person that they marry.
Indeed, arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life.
I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend.
The first one being women moving into the job market, the second one being the aging world population.
They're now saying that in America, that middle age should be regarded as up to age 85.
Because in that highest age category of 76 to 85, as much as 40 percent of people have nothing really wrong with them.
So we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age.
And I looked -- for one of my books, I looked at divorce data in 58 societies.
And as it turns out, the older you get, the less likely you are to divorce.
So the divorce rate right now is stable in America, and it's actually beginning to decline.
It may decline some more.
I would even say that with Viagra, estrogen replacement, hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women -- women have never been as interesting as they are now.
Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated, so interesting, so capable.
And so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages, that time is now.
However, there's always kinds of complications in this.
In these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment -- don't always go together.
They can go together, by the way.
That's why casual sex isn't so casual.
With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine.
Dopamine's associated with romantic love, and you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with.
With orgasm, then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin -- those are associated with attachment.
This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you've made love to them.
But these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment, aren't always connected to each other.
You can feel deep attachment to a long-term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else, while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners.
In short, we're capable of loving more than one person at a time.
In fact, you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else.
It's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do.
So I don't think, honestly, we're an animal that was built to be happy; we are an animal that was built to reproduce.
I think the happiness we find, we make.
And I think, however, we can make good relationships with each other.
So I want to conclude with two things.
I want to conclude with a worry -- I have a worry -- and with a wonderful story.
The worry is about antidepressants.
Over 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States.
And these drugs are going generic.
They are seeping around the world.
I know one girl who's been on these antidepressants, serotonin-enhancing -- SSRI, serotonin-enhancing antidepressants -- since she was 13.
She's 23. She's been on them ever since she was 13.
I've got nothing against people who take them short term, when they're going through something perfectly horrible.
They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else.
I would recommend it.
But more and more people in the United States are taking them long term.
And indeed, what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin.
And by raising levels of serotonin, you suppress the dopamine circuit.
Everybody knows that.
Dopamine is associated with romantic love.
Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit, but they kill the sex drive.
And when you kill the sex drive, you kill orgasm.
And when you kill orgasm, you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment.
The things are connected in the brain.
And when you tamper with one brain system, you're going to tamper with another.
I'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place.
So now -- -- thank you.
I want to end with a story. And then, just a comment.
I've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years.
I'm an identical twin; I am interested in why we're all alike.
Why you and I are alike, why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River are all alike.
And about a year ago, an Internet dating service, Match.com, came to me and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them.
I said, "I don't know anything about personality. You know?
I don't know. Do you think you've got the right person?"
They said, "Yes."
It got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another.
That's my current project; it will be my next book.
There's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another.
Timing is important. Proximity is important.
Mystery is important. You fall in love with somebody who's somewhat mysterious, in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain, probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love.
You fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your "love map," an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up.
And I also think that you gravitate to certain people, actually, with somewhat complementary brain systems.
And that's what I'm now contributing to this.
But I want to tell you a story about -- to illustrate.
I've been carrying on here about the biology of love.
I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it, too -- the magic of it.
It's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one of the -- probably a true story.
It was a graduate student at -- I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues -- Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook.
That's where we put our people in the MRI machine.
And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student, and she was not in love with him.
And they were all at a conference in Beijing.
And he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody, you can drive up the dopamine in the brain, and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love.
So he decided he'd put science to work, and he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him.
And sure enough -- I've never been in one, but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it's crazy and it's noisy and it's exciting.
And he figured that this would drive up the dopamine, and she would fall in love with him.
So off they go and she's squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time.
An hour later they get down off of the rickshaw, and she throws her hands up and she says, "Wasn't that wonderful?"
And, "Wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome!"
There's magic to love!
But I will end by saying that millions of years ago, we evolved three basic drives: the sex drive, romantic love and attachment to a long-term partner.
These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain.
They're going to survive as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called "this mortal coil."
Thank you.

<title>Helen Fisher: Why we love, why we cheat</title>
<description>Anthropologist Helen Fisher takes on a tricky topic – love – and explains its evolution, its biochemical foundations and its social importance. She closes with a warning about the potential disaster inherent in antidepressant abuse.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_attia_what_if_we_re_wrong_about_diabetes.html</url>
I'll never forget that day back in the spring of 2006.
I was a surgical resident at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, taking emergency call.
I got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer on her foot.
I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh as I pulled the curtain back to see her.
And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital.
That wasn't being asked.
The question that was being asked of me was a different one, which was, did she also need an amputation?
Now, looking back on that night, I'd love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman on that night with the same empathy and compassion I'd shown the 27-year-old newlywed who came to the E.R. three nights earlier with lower back pain that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer.
In her case, I knew there was nothing I could do that was actually going to save her life.
The cancer was too advanced.
But I was committed to making sure that I could do anything possible to make her stay more comfortable. I brought her a warm blanket and a cup of a coffee.
I brought some for her parents.
But more importantly, see, I passed no judgment on her, because obviously she had done nothing to bring this on herself.
So why was it that, just a few nights later, as I stood in that same E.R. and determined that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation, why did I hold her in such bitter contempt?
You see, unlike the woman the night before, this woman had type 2 diabetes.
She was fat.
And we all know that's from eating too much and not exercising enough, right?
I mean, how hard can it be?
As I looked down at her in the bed, I thought to myself, if you just tried caring even a little bit, you wouldn't be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you've never met about to amputate your foot.
Why did I feel justified in judging her?
I'd like to say I don't know.
But I actually do.
You see, in the hubris of my youth, I thought I had her all figured out.
She ate too much. She got unlucky.
She got diabetes. Case closed.
Ironically, at that time in my life, I was also doing cancer research, immune-based therapies for melanoma, to be specific, and in that world I was actually taught to question everything, to challenge all assumptions and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards.
Yet when it came to a disease like diabetes that kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma, I never once questioned the conventional wisdom.
I actually just assmed the pathologic sequence of events was settled science.
Three years later, I found out how wrong I was.
But this time, I was the patient.
Despite exercising three or four hours every single day, and following the food pyramid to the letter, I'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome.
Some of you may have heard of this.
I had become insulin-resistant.
You can think of insulin as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat, whether we burn it or store it.
This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo.
Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life.
And insulin resistance, as its name suggests, is when your cells get increasingly resistant to the effect of insulin trying to do its job.
Once you're insulin-resistant, you're on your way to getting diabetes, which is what happens when your pancreas can't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin.
Now your blood sugar levels start to rise, and an entire cascade of pathologic events sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease, cancer, even Alzheimer's disease, and amputations, just like that woman a few years earlier.
With that scare, I got busy changing my diet radically, adding and subtracting things most of you would find almost assuredly shocking.
I did this and lost 40 pounds, weirdly while exercising less.
I, as you can see, I guess I'm not overweight anymore.
More importantly, I don't have insulin resistance.
But most important, I was left with these three burning questions that wouldn't go away: How did this happen to me if I was supposedly doing everything right?
If the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me, was it possible it was failing someone else?
And underlying these questions, I became almost maniacally obsessed in trying to understand the real relationship between obesity and insulin resistance.
Now, most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance.
Logically, then, if you want to treat insulin resistance, you get people to lose weight, right?
You treat the obesity.
But what if we have it backwards?
What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all?
In fact, what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem, the tip of a proverbial iceberg?
I know it sounds crazy because we're obviously in the midst of an obesity epidemic, but hear me out.
What if obesity is a coping mechanism for a far more sinister problem going on underneath the cell?
I'm not suggesting that obesity is benign, but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils.
You can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity of ourselves to partition fuel, as I alluded to a moment ago, taking those calories that we take in and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately.
When we become insulin-resistant, the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state.
So now, when insulin says to a cell, I want you to burn more energy than the cell considers safe, the cell, in effect, says, "No thanks, I'd actually rather store this energy."
And because fat cells are actually missing most of the complex cellular machinery found in other cells, it's probably the safest place to store it.
So for many of us, about 75 million Americans, the appropriate response to insulin resistance may actually be to store it as fat, not the reverse, getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat.
This is a really subtle distinction, but the implication could be profound.
Consider the following analogy: Think of the bruise you get on your shin when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table.
Sure, the bruise hurts like hell, and you almost certainly don't like the discolored look, but we all know the bruise per se is not the problem.
In fact, it's the opposite. It's a healthy response to the trauma, all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread of infection to elsewhere in the body.
Now, imagine we thought bruises were the problem, and we evolved a giant medical establishment and a culture around treating bruises: masking creams, painkillers, you name it, all the while ignoring the fact that people are still banging their shins into coffee tables.
How much better would we be if we treated the cause -- telling people to pay attention when they walk through the living room -- rather than the effect?
Getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world.
Getting it wrong, and the pharmaceutical industry can still do very well for its shareholders but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins.
Cause and effect.
So what I'm suggesting is maybe we have the cause and effect wrong on obesity and insulin resistance.
Maybe we should be asking ourselves, is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity, at least in most people?
What if being obese is just a metabolic response to something much more threatening, an underlying epidemic, the one we ought to be worried about?
Let's look at some suggestive facts.
We know that 30 million obese Americans in the United States don't have insulin resistance.
And by the way, they don't appear to be at any greater risk of disease than lean people.
Conversely, we know that six million lean people in the United States are insulin-resistant, and by the way, they appear to be at even greater risk for those metabolic disease I mentioned a moment ago than their obese counterparts.
Now I don't know why, but it might be because, in their case, their cells haven't actually figured out the right thing to do with that excess energy.
So if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance, and you can be lean and have it, this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy for what's going on.
So what if we're fighting the wrong war, fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance?
Even worse, what if blaming the obese means we're blaming the victims?
What if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity are just wrong?
Personally, I can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore, let alone the luxury of certainty.
I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this, but I'm wide open to others.
Now, my hypothesis, because everybody always asks me, is this.
If you ask yourself, what's a cell trying to protect itself from when it becomes insulin resistant, the answer probably isn't too much food.
It's more likely too much glucose: blood sugar.
Now, we know that refined grains and starches elevate your blood sugar in the short run, and there's even reason to believe that sugar may lead to insulin resistance directly.
So if you put these physiological processes to work, I'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake of refined grains, sugars and starches that's driving this epidemic of obesity and diabetes, but through insulin resistance, you see, and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising.
When I lost my 40 pounds a few years ago, I did it simply by restricting those things, which admittedly suggests I have a bias based on my personal experience.
But that doesn't mean my bias is wrong, and most important, all of this can be tested scientifically.
But step one is accepting the possibility that our current beliefs about obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong and therefore must be tested.
I'm betting my career on this.
Today, I devote all of my time to working on this problem, and I'll go wherever the science takes me.
I've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore is pretend I have the answers when I don't.
I've been humbled enough by all I don't know.
For the past year, I've been fortunate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country, and the best part is, just like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals, we've done the same thing.
We've recruited a team of scientific rivals, the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses for what's at the heart of this epidemic.
Some think it's too many calories consumed.
Others think it's too much dietary fat.
Others think it's too many refined grains and starches.
But this team of multi-disciplinary, highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things.
First, this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer.
And two, if we're willing to be wrong, if we're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom with the best experiments science can offer, we can solve this problem.
I know it's tempting to want an answer right now, some form of action or policy, some dietary prescription -- eat this, not that — but if we want to get it right, we're going to have to do much more rigorous science before we can write that prescription.
Briefly, to address this, our research program is focused around three meta-themes, or questions.
First, how do the various foods we consume impact our metabolism, hormones and enzymes, and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms?
Second, based on these insights, can people make the necessary changes in their diets in a way that's safe and practical to implement?
And finally, once we identify what safe and practical changes people can make to their diet, how can we move their behavior in that direction so that it becomes more the default rather than the exception?
Just because you know what to do doesn't mean you're always going to do it.
Sometimes we have to put cues around people to make it easier, and believe it or not, that can be studied scientifically.
I don't know how this journey is going to end, but this much seems clear to me, at least: We can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients like I did.
Most of them actually want to do the right thing, but they have to know what that is, and it's got to work.
I dream of a day when our patients can shed their excess pounds and cure themselves of insulin resistance, because as medical professionals, we've shed our excess mental baggage and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently to go back to our original ideals: open minds, the courage to throw out yesterday's ideas when they don't appear to be working, and the understanding that scientific truth isn't final, but constantly evolving.
Staying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science.
If obesity is nothing more than a proxy for metabolic illness, what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy?
Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R.
seven years ago.
I wish I could speak with that woman again.
I'd like to tell her how sorry I am.
I'd say, as a doctor, I delivered the best clinical care I could, but as a human being, I let you down.
You didn't need my judgment and my contempt.
You needed my empathy and compassion, and above all else, you needed a doctor who was willing to consider maybe you didn't let the system down.
Maybe the system, of which I was a part, was letting you down.
If you're watching this now, I hope you can forgive me.

<title>Peter Attia: Is the obesity crisis hiding a bigger problem?</title>
<description>As a young surgeon, Peter Attia felt contempt for a patient with diabetes. She was overweight, he thought, and thus responsible for the fact that she needed a foot amputation. But years later, Attia received an unpleasant medical surprise that led him to wonder: is our understanding of diabetes right? Could the precursors to diabetes cause obesity, and not the other way around? A look at how assumptions may be leading us to wage the wrong medical war.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_ford_a_future_beyond_traffic_gridlock.html</url>
By birth and by choice, I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life, and for the past 30 years, I've worked at Ford Motor Company.
And for most of those years, I worried about, how am I going to sell more cars and trucks?
But today I worry about, what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks?
What happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles, triples, or even quadruples?
My life is guided by two great passions, and the first is automobiles.
I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company.
I thought it was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincoln and leave it in the driveway.
And I decided about that time, about age 10, that it would be really cool if I was a test driver.
So my parents would go to dinner.
They'd sit down; I'd sneak out of the house.
I'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway, and it was a blast.
And that went on for about two years, until -- I think I was about 12 -- my dad brought home a Lincoln Mark III.
And it was snowing that day.
So he and mom went to dinner, and I snuck out and thought it'd be really cool to do donuts or even some figure-eights in the snow.
My dad finished dinner early that evening.
And he was walking to the front hall and out the front door just about the same time I hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car -- and almost ended up in the front hall.
So it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while.
But I really began to love cars then.
And my first car was a 1975 electric-green Mustang.
And even though the color was pretty hideous, I did love the car, and it really cemented my love affair with cars that's continued on to this day.
But cars are really more than a passion of mine; they're quite literally in my blood.
My great grandfather was Henry Ford, and on my mother's side, my great grandfather was Harvey Firestone.
So when I was born, I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me.
But my great grandfather, Henry Ford, really believed that the mission of the Ford Motor Company was to make people's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them.
Because he believed that with mobility comes freedom and progress.
And that's a belief that I share.
My other great passion is the environment.
And as a young boy, I used to go up to Northern Michigan and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in and then later wrote about.
And it really struck me as the years went by, in a very negative way, when I would go to some stream that I'd loved, and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies, and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it.
And so even at a young age, that really resonated with me, and the whole notion of environmental preservation, at a very basic level, sunk in with me.
As a high-schooler, I started to read authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold and Edward Abbey, and I really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world.
But it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and trucks would ever be in conflict with nature.
And that was true until I got to college.
And when I got to college, you can imagine my surprise when I would go to class and a number of my professors would say that Ford Motor Company and my family was everything that was wrong with our country.
They thought that we were more interested, as an industry, in profits, rather than progress, and that we filled the skies with smog -- and frankly, we were the enemy.
I joined Ford after college, after some soul searching whether or not this is really the right thing to do.
But I decided that I wanted to go and see if I could affect change there.
And as I look back over 30 years ago, it was a little naive to think at that age that I could. But I wanted to.
And I really discovered that my professors weren't completely wrong.
In fact, when I got back to Detroit, my environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced by those in my own company, and certainly by those in the industry.
I had some very interesting conversations, as you can imagine.
There were some within Ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that I needed to stop hanging out with "environmental wackos."
I was considered a radical.
And I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists.
Of course, I had no intention of doing that, and I kept speaking out about the environment, and it really was the topic that we now today call sustainability.
And in time, my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today.
I mean, I think most people in the industry understand that we've got to get on with it.
And the good news is today we are tackling the big issues, of cars and the environment -- not only at Ford, but really as an industry.
We're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights.
And with new technology, we're reducing -- and I believe, someday we'll eliminate -- CO2 emissions.
We're starting to sell electric cars, which is great.
We're developing alternative powertrains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word -- economically, socially and environmentally.
And actually, although we've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do, I can see the day where my two great passions -- cars and the environment -- actually come into harmony.
But unfortunately, as we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem -- and as I said, we're not there yet; we've got a lot of work to do, but I can see where we will -- but even as we're in the process of doing that, another huge problem is looming, and people aren't noticing.
And that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened, just as the environment is.
The problem, put in its simplest terms, is one of mathematics.
Today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world, and within our lifetime, that number's going to grow to about nine billion.
And at that population level, our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth.
And with that growth comes some severe practical problems, one of which is our transportation system simply won't be able to deal with it.
When we look at the population growth in terms of cars, it becomes even clearer.
Today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide.
But with more people and greater prosperity around the world, that number's going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid century.
And this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before.
Now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives.
Today the average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams, and that's a huge waste of time and resources.
But that's nothing compared to what's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest.
Today the average driver in Beijing has a five-hour commute.
And last summer -- many of you probably saw this -- there was a hundred-mile traffic jam that took 11 days to clear in China.
In the decades to come, 75 percent of the world's population will live in cities, and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more.
So you can see the size of the issue that we're facing.
When you factor in population growth, it's clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow.
Frankly, four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars, and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam.
So, if we make no changes today, what does tomorrow look like?
Well I think you probably already have the picture.
Traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge, and they're really very, very inconvenient, but that's all they are.
But the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and health care, particularly to people that live in city centers.
And our quality of life is going to be severely compromised.
So what's going to solve this?
Well the answer isn't going to be more of the same.
My great grandfather once said before he invented the Model T, "If I had asked people then what they wanted, they would have answered, 'We want faster horses.'" So the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads.
When America began moving west, we didn't add more wagon trains, we built railroads.
And to connect our country after World War II, we didn't build more two-lane highways, we built the interstate highway system.
Today we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future.
We are going to build smart cars, but we also need to build smart roads, smart parking, smart public transportation systems and more.
We don't want to waste our time sitting in traffic, sitting at tollbooths or looking for parking spots.
We need an integrated system that uses real time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers.
And frankly, that's the kind of system that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable.
Now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world.
The city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another, and they go underneath the city streets.
And up above, you've got a series of pedestrian walkways.
On New York City's 34th Street, gridlock will soon be replaced with a connected system of vehicle-specific corridors.
Pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created, and all of this will cut down the average rush hour commute to get across town in New York from about an hour today at rush hour to about 20 minutes.
Now if you look at Hong Kong, they have a very interesting system called Octopus there.
It's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system.
So parking garages, buses, trains, they all operate within the same system.
Now shared car services are also springing up around the world, and these efforts, I think, are great.
They're relieving congestion, and they're frankly starting to save some fuel.
These are all really good ideas that will move us forward.
But what really inspires me is what's going to be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other.
Very soon, the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and GPS information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network.
Every morning I drive about 30 miles from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn, Michigan.
And every night I go home, my commute is a total crapshoot.
And I often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home.
But very soon we're going to see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other.
So if the car ahead of me on I-94 hits traffic, it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way.
And these systems are being tested right now, and frankly they're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon.
But the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless.
So just imagine: one day very soon, you're going to be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system.
So you get in your car, and as you get in your car, your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive -- no more driving around looking for one, which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel in today's cars in urban areas -- is looking for parking spots.
Or think about being in New York City and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone so you don't have to wait in the cold to hail one.
Or being at a future TED Conference and having your car talk to the calendars of everybody here and telling you all the best route to take home and when you should leave so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time.
This is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system.
So I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution to this enormous problem.
But as we found out with addressing CO2 issues, and also fossil fuels, there is no one silver bullet.
The solution is not going to be more cars, more roads or a new rail system; it can only be found, I believe, in a global network of interconnected solutions.
Now I know we can develop the technology that's going to make this work, but we've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions -- whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven't even thought of yet; our overall transportation-mix and infrastructure must support all the future options.
We need our best and our brightest to start entertaining this issue.
Companies, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity, as well as an enormous social problem.
And just as these groups embrace the green energy challenge -- and it's really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power, how much money and how much serious thought has, really over the last three years, just poured into the green energy field.
We need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gridlock.
But we need people like all of you in this room, leading thinkers.
I mean, frankly, I need all of you to think about how you can help solve this huge issue.
And we need people from all walks of life; not just inventors, we need policymakers and government officials to also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge.
This isn't going to be solved by any one person or one group.
It's going to really require a national energy policy, frankly for each country, because the solutions in each country are going to be different based upon income levels, traffic jams and also how integrated the systems already are.
But we need to get going, and we need to get going today.
And we must have an infrastructure that's designed to support this flexible future.
You know, we've come a long way.
Since the Model T, most people never traveled more than 25 miles from home in their entire lifetime.
And since then, the automobile has allowed us the freedom to choose where we live, where we work, where we play and frankly when we just go out and want to move around.
We don't want to regress and lose that freedom.
We're on our way to solving -- the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it, and that's the environmental issue, but I believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock.
Because in doing so, we're going to preserve what we've really come to take for granted, which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world.
And it frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this.
Because, if you can envision, as I do, a future of zero emissions and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today, that's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow.
I believe we're at our best when we're confronted with big issues.
This is a big one, and it won't wait.
So let's get started now.
Thank you.

<title>Bill Ford: A future beyond traffic gridlock</title>
<description>Bill Ford is a car guy -- his great-grandfather was Henry Ford, and he grew up inside the massive Ford Motor Co. So when he worries about cars' impact on the environment, and about our growing global gridlock problem, it's worth a listen. His vision for the future of mobility includes "smart roads," even smarter public transport and going green like never before.</description>

Hello. Actually, that's "hello" in Bauer Bodoni for the typographically hysterical amongst us.
One of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the Big wants -- the "Big" being the organization, the system, the country -- and what the "Small" wants -- the individual, the person.
And how do you bring those two things together?
Charlie Ledbetter, yesterday, I thought, talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers, to bring people into the process of creating things.
And that's what I want to talk about today.
So, bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big, I think, is something that we believe in -- something I believe in, and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at Ideo.
I call this first chapter -- for the Brits in the room -- the "Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious."
Often, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face that you kind of miss them. And I think, a lot of times, what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go, "Duh! You know, look what's really going on."
And rather than talk about it in the theory, I think I'm just going to show you an example.
We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota to describe to them what their patient experience was.
And I think they were expecting -- they'd worked with lots of consultants before -- I think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart with thousands of bubbles and systemic this, that and the other, and all kinds of mappy stuff.
Or even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thing with WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever.
The first thing we actually shared with them was this.
I'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve.
This is 59 seconds into the film.
This is a minute 59.
3:19.
I think something happens. I think a head may appear in a second.
5:10.
5:58.
6:20.
We showed them the whole cut, and they were all completely, what is this?
And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day, all you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience.
And just putting yourself in the position of the patient -- this is Christian, who works with us at Ideo.
He just lay in the hospital bed, and, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time.
That's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital.
And they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.
Oh, my goodness. So, looking at the situation from the point of view of the person out -- as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in -- was, for these guys, quite a revelation.
And so, that was a really catalytic thing for them.
So they snapped into action.
They said, OK, it's not about systemic change.
It's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do.
It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference.
So we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact.
The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley, so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor, you could actually have a conversation with them.
You could, kind of, see them in your rear-view mirror, so it created a tiny human interaction.
Very small example of something that they could do.
Interestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action -- said, OK, we embrace this. What can we do?
The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling.
Which I thought was really -- I showed this to my mother recently.
I think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator.
It's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.
Not particularly the world's best design solution for those of us who are real, sort of, hard-core designers, but nonetheless, a fabulous empathic solution for people.
Things that they started doing themselves -- like changing the floor going into the patient's room so that it signified, "This is my room. This is my personal space" -- was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem.
So you went from public space to private space.
And another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses -- which I love -- was they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards, then they put them on one wall of the patient's room, and they put this sticker there.
So that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick in that room, which was lovely.
So, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact.
I thought that was a really, really nice example.
So this is not particularly a new idea, kind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution.
It's a history of invention based around this.
I'm going to read this because I want to get these names right.
Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter -- came down on a Saturday morning, saw her daughter watching the test card, waiting for programs to come on one morning and from that came Sesame Street.
Malcolm McLean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship.
And he invented the shipping container.
George de Mestral -- this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock -- was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs, sort of little prickly things, and from that came Velcro.
And finally, for the Brits, Percy Shaw -- this is a big British invention -- saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road, when he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye.
So there's a whole series of just using your eyes, seeing things for the first time, seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities.
Second one, without sounding overly Zen, and this is a quote from the Buddha: "Finding yourself in the margins, looking to the edges of things, is often a really interesting place to start."
Blinkered vision tends to produce, I think, blinkered solutions.
So, looking wide, using your peripheral vision, is a really interesting place to look for opportunity.
Again, another medical example here.
We were asked by a device producer -- we did the Palm Pilot and the Treo.
We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo -- they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics.
This was a device that a nurse uses when they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital.
They'll ask the nurses to input data.
And they had this vision of the nurse, kind of, clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly, sort of, gadget-lustish.
When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place -- and I'll explain this in a second -- it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing.
When you're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine -- which was the procedure that this device's data was about; it was for pain management -- you're shit scared; you're freaking out.
And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did, was hold the patient's hand to comfort them. Human gesture -- which made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible.
So, the thing that we designed, much less sexy but much more human and practical, was this.
So, it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination, but it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand.
So, again, going back to this -- the idea that a tiny human gesture dictated the design of this product.
And I think that's really, really important.
So, again, this idea of workarounds.
We use this phrase "workarounds" a lot, sort of, looking around us. I was actually looking around the TED and just watching all of these kind of things happen while I've been here.
This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life -- and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential -- is something that we look at a lot.
We wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it, called "Thoughtless Acts?"
It's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do, which have huge intention and huge opportunity.
Why do we all follow the line in the street?
This is a picture in a Japanese subway.
People consciously follow things even though, why, we don't know.
Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence?
Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to.
We don't know why, but we do.
Why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle?
Again, we're sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions.
And we're always saying to our clients: "You should look at this stuff.
This stuff is really important. This stuff is really vital."
This is people designing their own experiences.
You can draw from this.
We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street, that it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there.
It's there for our use, on some level.
So, again, we sort of co-opt our environment to do all these different things.
We co-opt other experiences -- we take one item and transfer it to another.
And this is my favorite one. My mother used to say to me, "Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to."
But, of course, we all do. We all follow each other every day.
So somebody assumes that because somebody else has done something, that's permission for them to do the same thing.
And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time.
I mean, shopping bag equals "parking meter out of order."
And we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now.
We all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we're doing.
Third section is this idea of not knowing, of consciously putting yourself backwards.
I talk about unthinking situations all the time.
Sort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh.
A friend of mine was a designer at IKEA, and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children.
This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.
Hammer it together. Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me, because they're impossible to assemble.
But big selling bookcase. How do we replicate this for children?
The reality is when you actually watch children, children don't think about things like storage in linear terms.
Children assume permission in a very different way.
Children live on things. They live under things.
They live around things, and so their spatial awareness relationship, and their thinking around storage is totally different.
So the first thing you have to do -- this is Graham, the designer -- is, sort of, put yourself in their shoes. And so, here he is sitting under the table.
So, what came out of this?
This is the storage system that he designed.
So what is this? I hear you all ask. No, I don't.
It's this, and I think this is a particularly lovely solution.
So, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation.
It's a completely empathic solution -- apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it.
But a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary, and I think that's one of the things.
And putting yourself in the position of the person, and I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again from this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel?
And then use that information to fuel solutions?
And I think that's what this is very much about.
Last section: green armband. We've all got them.
It's about this really.
I mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win.
Again, that's one of the themes that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference is: Where do we start? How do we start? What do we do to start?
So, again, we were asked to design a water pump for a company called ApproTEC, in Kenya.
They're now called KickStart.
And, again, as designers, we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form.
And that was completely irrelevant.
When you put yourself in the position of these people, things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle, become much more relevant than the form of it. The way it's produced, it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods and indigenous materials.
So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user.
We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world.
So what seems like a very clunky product is, in fact, incredibly useful.
It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster -- you pump up and down on it.
Children can use it. Adults can use it. Everybody uses it.
It's turning these guys -- again, one of the themes -- it's turning them into entrepreneurs.
These guys are using this very successfully.
And for us, it's been great because it's won loads of design awards.
So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company, the needs of the individuals in the company, to feel good about a product we were actually designing, and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for.
There it is, pumping water from 30 feet.
So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning.
We've made a donation on everybody's behalf here to kick start, no pun intended, their next project.
Because, again, I think, sort of, putting our money where our mouth is, here.
We feel that this is an important gesture.
So we've handed out bracelets. Small is the new big.
I hope you'll all wear them.
So that's it. Thank you.

Contagious is a good word.
Even in the times of H1N1, I like the word.
Laughter is contagious. Passion is contagious.
Inspiration is contagious.
We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers.
But for me, what was contagious about all of them was that they were infected by something I call the "I Can" bug.
So, the question is, why only them?
In a country of a billion people and some, why so few?
Is it luck? Is it chance?
Can we all not systematically and consciously get infected?
So, in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story.
I got infected when I was 17, when, as a student of the design college, I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas, challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me.
And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt, and how contagious that feeling was.
I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.
So, when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab, a lab to prototype and refine a design process that could consciously infect the mind with the "I Can" bug.
And I uncovered that if learning is embedded in real-world context, that if you blur the boundaries between school and life, then children go through a journey of "aware," where they can see the change, "enable," be changed, and then "empower," lead the change.
And that directly increased student wellbeing.
Children became more competent, and less helpless.
But this was all common sense.
So, I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at Riverside.
A little background: when my grade five was learning about child rights, they were made to roll incense sticks, agarbattis, for eight hours to experience what it means to be a child laborer.
It transformed them. What you will see is their journey, and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world.
That's them rolling.
And in two hours, after their backs were broke, they were changed.
And once that happened, they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished.
And look at Ragav, that moment when his face changes because he's been able to understand that he has shifted that man's mindset.
And that can't happen in a classroom.
So, when Ragav experienced that he went from "teacher told me," to "I am doing it." And that's the "I Can" mindshift.
And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured.
But we had parents who said, "Okay, making our children good human beings is all very well, but what about math and science and English?
Show us the grades."
And we did. The data was conclusive.
When children are empowered, not only do they do good, they do well, in fact very well, as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over 2,000 schools in India, Riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India in math, English and science.
So, it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside.
So, on August 15th, Independence Day, 2007, the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad.
Now it was not about Riverside school.
It was about all children. So, we were shameless.
We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation, the police, the press, businesses, and basically said, "When are you going to wake up and recognize the potential that resides in every child?
When will you include the child in the city?
Basically, open your hearts and your minds to the child."
So, how did the city respond?
Since 2007 every other month the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children and childhood.
Here was a city telling its child, "You can."
A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad.
[Unclear] So, the busiest streets closed down.
We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us.
It gets taken over by children.
They are skating. They are doing street plays.
They are playing, all free, for all children.
Atul Karwal: aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier.
And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city.
Kiran Bir Sethi: And the city will give free time.
And Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world.
Geet Sethi: When a city gives to the children, in the future the children will give back to the city.
K And because of that, Ahmedabad is known as India's first child-friendly city.
So, you're getting the pattern. First 200 children at Riverside.
Then 30,000 children in Ahmedabad, and growing.
It was time now to infect India.
So, on August 15th, again, Independence Day, 2009, empowered with the same process, we empowered 100,000 children to say, "I can."
How? We designed a simple toolkit, converted it into eight languages, and reached 32,000 schools.
We basically gave children a very simple challenge.
We said, take one idea, anything that bothers you, choose one week, and change a billion lives.
And they did. Stories of change poured in from all over India, from Nagaland in the east, to Jhunjhunu in the west, from Sikkim in the north, to Krishnagiri in the south.
Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems.
Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street to alcoholism, and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages in Rajasthan.
I mean, it was incredible.
Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children and say, "You can," then they will.
Infection in India.
This is in Rajasthan, a rural village.
Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write.
K First time, a rally and a street play in a rural school -- unheard of -- to tell their parents why literacy is important.
Look at what their parents says.
This program is wonderful.
We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write.
I am so happy that my students did this campaign.
In the future, I will never doubt my students' abilities.
See? They have done it.
K An inner city school in Hyderabad.
Girl: 581. This house is 581 ...
We have to start collecting from 555.
K Girls and boys in Hyderabad, going out, pretty difficult, but they did it.
Even though they are so young, they have done such good work.
First they have cleaned the society, then it will be Hyderabad, and soon India.
It was a revelation for me. It doesn't strike me that they had so much inside them.
Girl: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you, for a very good cause, the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids.
Are you ready, ladies and gentlemen? Audience: Yes!
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!
K So, the charter of compassion starts right here.
Street plays, auctions, petitions.
I mean, they were changing lives.
It was incredible.
So, how can we still stay immune?
How can we stay immune to that passion, that energy, that excitement?
I know it's obvious, but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change, Gandhiji.
70 years ago, it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of "We can."
So, today who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in India?
Last I heard, the preamble still said, "We, the people of India," right?
So, if not us, then who?
If not now, then when?
Like I said, contagious is a good word.
Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/norman_foster_s_green_agenda.html</url>
As an architect you design for the present, with an awareness of the past, for a future which is essentially unknown.
The green agenda is probably the most important agenda and issue of the day.
And I'd like to share some experience over the last 40 years -- we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year -- and to explore and to touch on some observations about the nature of sustainability.
How far you can anticipate, what follows from it, what are the threats, what are the possibilities, the challenges, the opportunities?
I think that -- I've said in the past, many, many years ago, before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda, that it wasn't about fashion -- it was about survival.
But what I never said, and what I'm really going to make the point is, that really, green is cool.
I mean, all the projects which have, in some way, been inspired by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle, in a way celebrating the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life.
I rarely actually quote anything, so I'm going to try and find a piece of paper if I can, [in] which somebody, at the end of last year, ventured the thought about what for that individual, as a kind of important observer, analyst, writer -- a guy called Thomas Friedman, who wrote in the Herald Tribune, about 2006.
He said, "I think the most important thing to happen in 2006 was that living and thinking green hit Main Street.
We reached a tipping point this year where living, acting, designing, investing and manufacturing green came to be understood by a critical mass of citizens, entrepreneurs and officials as the most patriotic, capitalistic, geo-political and competitive thing they could do.
Hence my motto: green is the new red, white and blue."
And I asked myself, in a way, looking back, "When did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear?"
And I think it was July 20, 1969, when, for the first time, man could look back at planet Earth.
And, in a way, it was Buckminster Fuller who coined that phrase.
And before the kind of collapse of the communist system, I was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts in Space City and other places in Russia.
And interestingly, as I think back, they were the first true environmentalists.
They were filled with a kind of pioneering passion, fired about the problems of the Aral Sea.
And at that period it was -- in a way, a number of things were happening.
Buckminster Fuller was the kind of green guru -- again, a word that had not been coined.
He was a design scientist, if you like, a poet, but he foresaw all the things that are happening now.
It's another subject. It's another conversation.
You can go back to his writings: it's quite extraordinary.
It was at that time, with an awareness fired by Bucky's prophecies, his concerns as a citizen, as a kind of citizen of the planet, that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time.
And it's a number of projects.
I select this one because it was 1973, and it was a master plan for one of the Canary Islands.
And this probably coincided with the time when you had the planet Earth's sourcebook, and you had the hippie movement.
And there are some of those qualities in this drawing, which seeks to sum up the recommendations.
And all the components are there which are now in common parlance, in our vocabulary, you know, 30-odd years later: wind energy, recycling, biomass, solar cells.
And in parallel at that time, there was a very kind of exclusive design club.
People who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of Dieter Rams, and the objects that he would create for the company called Braun.
This is going back the mid-'50s, '60s.
And despite Bucky's prophecies that everything would be miniaturized and technology would make an incredible style -- access to comfort, to amenities -- it was very, very difficult to imagine that everything that we see in this image, would be very, very stylishly packaged.
And that, and more besides, would be in the palm of your hand.
And I think that that digital revolution now is coming to the point where, as the virtual world, which brings so many people together here, finally connects with the physical world, there is the reality that that has become humanized, so that digital world has all the friendliness, all the immediacy, the orientation of the analog world.
Probably summed up in a way by the stylish or alternative available here, as we generously had gifted at lunchtime, the [unclear], which is a further kind of development -- and again, inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel.
A very, very beautiful object.
So, something which in [the] '50s, '60s was very exclusive has now become, interestingly, quite inclusive.
And the reference to the iPod as iconic, and in a way evocative of performance, delivery -- quite interesting that [in] the beginning of the year 2007, the Financial Times commented that the Detroit companies envy the halo effect that Toyota has gained from the Prius as the hybrid, energy-conscious vehicle, which rivals the iPod as an iconic product.
And I think it's very tempting to, in a way, seduce ourselves -- as architects, or anybody involved with the design process -- that the answer to our problems lies with buildings.
Buildings are important, but they're only a component of a much bigger picture.
In other words, as I might seek to demonstrate, if you could achieve the impossible, the equivalent of perpetual motion, you could design a carbon-free house, for example.
That would be the answer.
Unfortunately, it's not the answer.
It's only the beginning of the problem.
You cannot separate the buildings out from the infrastructure of cites and the mobility of transit.
For example, if, in that Bucky-inspired phrase, we draw back and we look at planet Earth, and we take a kind of typical, industrialized society, then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings, 44 percent, transport, 34 percent, and industry.
But again, that only shows part of the picture.
If you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport, in other words, the transport of people, which is 26 percent, then 70 percent of the energy consumption is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together.
So the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the cities, of which the buildings are a part.
For example, if you take, and you make a comparison between a recent kind of city, what I'll call, simplistically, a North American city -- and Detroit is not a bad example, it is very car dependent.
The city goes out in annular rings, consuming more and more green space, and more and more roads, and more and more energy in the transport of people between the city center -- which again, the city center, as it becomes deprived of the living and just becomes commercial, again becomes dead.
If you compared Detroit with a city of a Northern European example -- and Munich is not a bad example of that, with the greater dependence on walking and cycling -- then a city which is really only twice as dense, is only using one-tenth of the energy.
In other words, you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous.
So basically, if you wanted to generalize, you can demonstrate that as the density increases along the bottom there, that the energy consumed reduces dramatically.
Of course you can't separate this out from issues like social diversity, mass transit, the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance, the quality of civic spaces.
But again, you can see Detroit, in yellow at the top, extraordinary consumption, down below Copenhagen.
And Copenhagen, although it's a dense city, is not dense compared with the really dense cities.
In the year 2000, a rather interesting thing happened.
You had for the first time mega-cities, [of] 5 million or more, which were occurring in the developing world.
And now, out of typically 46 cities, 33 of those mega-cities are in the developing world.
So you have to ask yourself -- the environmental impact of, for example, China or India.
If you take China, and you just take Beijing, you can see on that traffic system, and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles.
In other words, if you put onto the roads, as is currently happening, 1,000 new cars every day -- statistically, it's the biggest booming auto market in the world -- and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing.
And that urbanization is extraordinary, accelerated pace.
So, if we think of the transition in our society of the movement from the land to the cities, which took 200 years, then that same process is happening in 20 years.
In other words, it is accelerating by a factor of 10.
And quite interestingly, over something like a 60-year period, we're seeing the doubling in life expectancy, over that period where the urbanization has trebled.
If I pull back from that global picture, and I look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology -- which, as a tool, is a tool for designers, and I cite our own experience as a company, and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects -- then how do you measure that change of technology?
How does it affect the design of buildings?
And particularly, how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy, create less pollution and are more socially responsible?
That story, in terms of buildings, started in the late '60s, early '70s.
The one example I take is a corporate headquarters for a company called Willis and Faber, in a small market town in the northeast of England, commuting distance with London.
And here, the first thing you can see is that this building, the roof is a very warm kind of overcoat blanket, a kind of insulating garden, which is also about the celebration of public space.
In other words, for this community, they have this garden in the sky.
So the humanistic ideal is very, very strong in all this work, encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here, where you can see greenery, you can see sunlight, you have a connection with nature.
And nature is part of the generator, the driver for this building.
And symbolically, the colors of the interior are green and yellow.
It has facilities like swimming pools, it has flextime, it has a social heart, a space, you have contact with nature.
Now this was 1973.
In 2001, this building received an award.
And the award was about a celebration for a building which had been in use over a long period of time.
And the people who'd created it came back: the project managers, the company chairmen then.
And they were saying, you know, "The architects, Norman was always going on about designing for the future, and you know, it didn't seem to cost us any more.
So we humored him, we kept him happy."
The image at the top, what it doesn't -- if you look at it in detail, really what it is saying is you can wire this building.
This building was wired for change.
So, in 1975, the image there is of typewriters.
And when the photograph was taken, it's word processors.
And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology.
We were fortunate, because in a way our building was future-proofed.
It anticipated change, even though those changes were not known.
Round about that design period leading up to this building, I did a sketch, which we pulled out of the archive recently.
And I was saying, and I wrote, "But we don't have the time, and we really don't have the immediate expertise at a technical level."
In other words, we didn't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building.
And that would be to create a kind of three-dimensional bubble -- a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate, would breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads.
Notwithstanding the fact that the building, as a green building, is very much a pioneering building.
And if I fast-forward in time, what is interesting is that the technology is now available and celebratory.
The library of the Free University, which opened last year, is an example of that.
And again, the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality.
And a combination of devices here, the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks, and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin, which enables the building to be ventilated, to consume dramatically less energy, and where it's really working with the forces of nature.
And what is interesting is that this is hugely popular by the people who use it.
Again, coming back to that thing about the lifestyle, and in a way, the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit.
So it's not a kind of sacrifice, quite the reverse.
I think it's a great -- it's a celebration.
And you can measure the performance, in terms of energy consumption, of that building against a typical library.
If I show another aspect of that technology then, in a completely different context -- this apartment building in the Alps in Switzerland.
Prefabricated from the most traditional of materials, but that material -- because of the technology, the computing ability, the ability to prefabricate, make high-performance components out of timber -- very much at the cutting edge.
And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology, the ability to plot points in the sky and to transmit, to transfer that information now, directly into the factory.
So if you cross the border -- just across the border -- a small factory in Germany, and here you can see the guy with his computer screen, and those points in space are communicated.
And on the left are the cutting machines, which then, in the factory, enable those individual pieces to be fabricated and plus or minus very, very few millimeters, to be slotted together on site.
And then interestingly, that building to then be clad in the oldest technology, which is the kind of hand-cut shingles.
One quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish.
And again, the way in which that works as a building, for those of us who can enjoy the spaces, to live and visit there.
If I made the leap into these new technologies, then how did we -- what happened before that?
I mean, you know, what was life like before the mobile phone, the things that you take for granted?
Well, obviously the building still happened.
I mean, this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of 1979, which opened in 1985, with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of this space here.
And in the absence of computers, you have to physically model.
So for example, we would put models under an artificial sky.
For wind tunnels, we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air, and the many kilometers of cable and so on.
And the turning point was probably, in our terms, when we had the first computer.
And that was at the time that we sought to redesign, reinvent the airport.
This is Terminal Four at Heathrow, typical of any terminal -- big, heavy roof, blocking out the sunlight, lots of machinery, big pipes, whirring machinery.
And Stansted, the green alternative, which uses natural light, is a friendly place: you know where you are, you can relate to the outside.
And for a large part of its cycle, not needing electric light -- electric light, which in turn creates more heat, which creates more cooling loads and so on.
And at that particular point in time, this was one of the few solitary computers.
And that's a little image of the tree of Stansted.
Not going back very far in time, 1990, that's our office.
And if you looked very closely, you'd see that people were drawing with pencils, and they were pushing, you know, big rulers and triangles.
It's not that long ago, 17 years, and here we are now.
I mean, major transformation.
Going back in time, there was a lady called Valerie Larkin, and in 1987, she had all our information on one disk.
Now, every week, we have the equivalent of 84 million disks, which record our archival information on past, current and future projects.
That reaches 21 kilometers into the sky.
This is the view you would get, if you looked down on that.
But meanwhile, as you know, wonderful protagonists like Al Gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature, set in the context of that, interestingly, those buildings which are celebratory and very, very relevant to this place.
Our Reichstag project, which has a very familiar agenda, I'm sure, as a public place where we sought to, in a way, through a process of advocacy, reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians, public space. And maybe its hidden agenda, an energy manifesto -- something that would be free, completely free of fuel as we know it.
So it would be totally renewable.
And again, the humanistic sketch, the translation into the public space, but this very, very much a part of the ecology.
But here, not having to model it for real.
Obviously the wind tunnel had a place, but the ability now with the computer to explore, to plan, to see how that would work in terms of the forces of nature: natural ventilation, to be able to model the chamber below, and to look at biomass.
A combination of biomass, aquifers, burning vegetable oil -- a process that, quite interestingly, was developed in Eastern Germany, at the time of its dependence on the Soviet Bloc.
So really, retranslating that technology and developing something which was so clean, it was virtually pollution-free.
You can measure it again.
You can compare how that building, in terms of its emission in tons of carbon dioxide per year -- at the time that we took that project, over 7,000 tons -- what it would have been with natural gas and finally, with the vegetable oil, 450 tons.
I mean, a 94 percent reduction -- virtually clean.
We can see the same processes at work in terms of the Commerce Bank -- its dependence on natural ventilation, the way that you can model those gardens, the way they spiral around.
But again, very much about the lifestyle, the quality -- something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work.
And again, we can measure the reduction in terms of energy consumption.
There is an evolution here between the projects, and Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further -- the project in the city in London.
And this sequence shows the buildup of that model.
But what it shows first, which I think is quite interesting, is that here you see the circle, you see the public space around it.
What are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site?
If, for example, you seek to do a building which goes right to the edge of the pavement, it's the same amount of space.
And finally, you profile this, you cut grooves into it.
The grooves become the kind of green lungs which give views, which give light, ventilation, make the building fresher.
And you enclose that with something that also is central to its appearance, which is a mesh of triangulated structures -- again, in a long connection evocative of some of those works of Buckminster Fuller, and the way in which triangulation can increase performance and also give that building its sense of identity.
And here, if we look at a detail of the way that the building opens up and breathes into those atria, the way in which now, with a computer, we can model the forces, we can see the high pressure, the low pressure, the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing.
So it also has the ability, all the time, regardless of the direction of the wind, to be able to make the building fresh and efficient.
And unlike conventional buildings, the top of the building is celebratory.
It's a viewing place for people, not machinery.
And the base of the building is again about public space.
Comparing it with a typical building, what happens if we seek to use such design strategies in terms of really large-scale thinking?
And I'm just going to give two images out of a kind of company research project.
It's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying.
The level is dropping, rather like the Aral Sea.
And the Dead Sea is obviously much lower than the oceans and seas around it.
So there has been a project which rescues the Dead Sea by creating a pipeline, a pipe, sometimes above the surface, sometimes buried, that will redress that, and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba into the Dead Sea.
And our translation of that, using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years, is to say, what if that, instead of being just a pipe, what if it is a lifeline?
What if it is the equivalent, depending on where you are, of the Grand Canal, in terms of tourists, habitation, desalination, agriculture?
In other words, water is the lifeblood.
And if you just go back to the previous image, and you look at this area of volatility and hostility, that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together in a united cause, in terms of something that would be genuinely green and productive in the widest sense.
Infrastructure at that large scale is also inseparable from communication.
And whether that communication is the virtual world or it is the physical world, then it's absolutely central to society.
And how do we make more legible in this growing world, especially in some of the places that I'm talking about -- China, for example, which in the next ten years will create 400 new airports.
Now what form do they take?
How do you make them more friendly at that scale?
Hong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age, because you always have a point of reference.
So what happens when we take that and you expand that further into the Chinese society?
And what is interesting is that that produces in a way perhaps the ultimate mega-building.
It is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment.
250 -- excuse me, 50,000 people working 24 hours, seven days.
Larger by 17 percent than every terminal put together at Heathrow -- built -- plus the new, un-built Terminal Five.
And the challenge here is a building that will be green, that is compact despite its size and is about the human experience of travel, is about friendly, is coming back to that starting point, is very, very much about the lifestyle.
And perhaps these, in the end, as celebratory spaces.
As Hubert was talking over lunch, as we sort of engaged in conversation, talked about this, talked about cities.
Hubert was saying, absolutely correctly, "These are the new cathedrals."
And in a way, one aspect of this conversation was triggered on New Year's Eve, when I was talking about the Olympic agenda in China in terms of its green ambitions and aspirations.
And I was voicing the thought that -- it just crossed my mind that New Year's Eve, a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007 -- that maybe, you know, the future was the most powerful, innovative sort of nation.
The way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say, "We put a man on the moon."
You know, who is going to say that we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels, with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes, and so on.
And that's a concerted platform.
It's more than one device, you know, it's renewable.
And I voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year, I thought that the inspiration was more likely to come from those other, larger countries out there -- the Chinas, the Indias, the Asian-Pacific tigers.
Thank you very much.

<title>Norman Foster: My green agenda for architecture</title>
<description>Architect Norman Foster discusses his own work to show how computers can help architects design buildings that are green, beautiful and "basically pollution-free." From the 2007 DLD Conference, Munich; www.dld-conference.com</description>
<keywords>architecture,cities,green</keywords>
<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/rogier_van_der_heide_why_light_needs_darkness.html</url>
There's a beautiful statement on the screen that says, "Light creates ambiance, and light is also the expression of structure."
Well that was not by me.
That was, of course, by Le Corbusier, the famous architect.
And here you can see what he meant in one of his beautiful buildings -- the chapel Notre Dame du Haut, Ronchamp -- where he creates this light that he could only make because there's also dark.
And I think that is the quintessence of this 18-minute talk -- that there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well-being without proper darkness.
So this is how we normally would light our offices.
We have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much lux and of great uniformity.
This is how we create uniform lighting from one wall to the other in a regular grid of lamps.
And that is quite different from what I just showed you from Le Corbusier.
If we would apply these codes and standards to the Pantheon in Rome, it would never have looked like this, because this beautiful light feature can only appear because there is also darkness in that same building.
And the same is more or less what Santiago Calatrava said when he said, "Light: I make it in my buildings for comfort."
And he didn't mean the comfort of a five-course dinner as opposed to a one-course meal, but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people.
He meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun.
And he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky, and where you can experience the sun, that give us a better life in the built environment, just because of the relevance of light in its brightness and also in its shadows.
What it all boils down to is, of course, the sun.
And this image of the sun may suggest that the sun is something evil and aggressive, but we should not forget that all energy on this planet actually comes from the sun, and light is only a manifestation of that energy.
The sun is for dynamics, for color changes.
The sun is for beauty in our environment, like in this building -- the High Museum in Atlanta, which has been created by Renzo Piano from Italy, together with Arup Lighting, a brilliant team of lighting designers, who created a very subtle modulation of light across the space, responding to what the sun does outside, just because of all these beautiful openings in the roof.
So in an indirect way, you can see the sun.
And what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum.
They created this shade that you can see here, which actually covers the sun, but opens up to the good light from the sky.
And here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models, with quantitative, as well as qualitative, methods to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture.
They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way.
As you can see here, there's some direct light on the floor, but they could easily figure out where that comes from.
And they allow people in that building to really enjoy the sun, the good part of the sun.
And enjoying the sun can be in many different ways, of course.
It can be just like this, or maybe like this, which is rather peculiar, but this is in 1963 -- the viewing of a sun eclipse in the United States.
And it's just a bit bright up there, so these people have found a very intriguing solution.
This is, I think, a very illustrative image of what I try to say -- that the beautiful dynamics of sun, bringing these into the building, creates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives.
And this is all about darkness as much as it is about lightness, of course, because otherwise you don't see these dynamics.
As opposed to the first office that I showed you in the beginning of the talk, this is a well-known office, which is the White Group.
They are in green energy consulting, or something like that.
And they really practice what they preach because this office doesn't have any electric lighting at all.
It has only on one side this big, big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range.
So it can be very dim over there, and you do your work, and it can be very bright over there, and you do your work.
But actually the human eye turns out to be remarkably adaptable to all these different light conditions that together create an environment that is never boring and that is never dull, and therefore helps us to enhance our lives.
I really owe a short introduction of this man to you.
This is Richard Kelly who was born 100 years ago, which is the reason I bring him up now, because it's kind of an anniversary year.
In the 1930s, Richard Kelly was the first person to really describe a methodology of modern lighting design.
And he coined three terms, which are "focal glow," "ambient luminescence" and "play of the brilliants" -- three very distinctly different ideas about light in architecture that all together make up this beautiful experience.
So you begin with focal glow.
He meant something like this -- where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around.
Or something like this, which is the lighting design he did for General Motors, for the car showroom.
And you enter that space, and you feel like, "Wow! This is so impressive," just because of this focal point, this huge light source in the middle.
To me it is something from theatre, and I will get back to that a little bit later.
It's the spotlight on the artist that helps you to focus.
It could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and lights up a patch of the land, highlighting it compared to the dim environment.
lighting the merchandise and creating accents that help you to get around.
Ambient luminescence is something very different.
Richard Kelly saw it as something infinite, something without any focus, something where all details actually dissolve in infinity.
And I see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to relax and to contemplate.
It could also be something like this: the National Museum of Science in London, where this blue is embracing all the exhibitions and galleries And then finally, Kelly's play of brilliants attitude, that really some play of the skyline of Hong Kong, or perhaps the chandelier in the opera house, or in the theater here, which is a decoration, the icing on the cake, something playful, something that is just an addition to the architectural environment, I would say.
These three distinct elements, together, make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better.
And we can only create these out of darkness.
And I will explain that further.
And I guess that is something that Richard Kelly, here on the left, was explaining to Ludwig Mies Van der Rohe.
And behind them, you see that Seagram Building that later turned into an icon of modern lighting design.
Those times, there were some early attempts also for light therapy already.
You can see here a photo from the United States Library of Medicine, where people are put in the sun to get better.
It's a little bit of a different story, this health aspect of light, than what I'm telling you today.
In today's modern medicine, there is a real understanding of light in an almost biochemical way.
And there is the idea that, when we look at things, it is the yellow light that helps us the most, that we are the most sensitive for.
But our circadian rhythms, which are the rhythms that help us to wake and sleep and be alert and relaxed and so forth and so on, they are much more triggered by blue light.
And by modulating the amount of blue in our environment, we can help people to relax, or to be alert, to fall asleep, or to stay awake.
And that is how, maybe in the near future, light can help hospitals to make people better sooner, recover them quicker.
Maybe in the airplane, we can overcome jet lag like that.
Perhaps in school, we can help children to learn better because they concentrate more on their work.
And you can imagine a lot more applications.
But I would like to talk further about the combination of light and darkness as a quality in our life.
So light is, of course, for social interaction also -- to create relationships with all the features around us.
It is the place where we gather around when we have to say something to each other.
And it is all about this planet.
But when you look at this planet at night, it looks like this.
And I think this is the most shocking image in my talk today.
Because all this light here goes up to the sky.
It never reaches the ground where it was meant for.
It never is to the benefit of people.
It only spoils the darkness.
So at a global scale, it looks like this.
And, I mean, that is quite amazing, what you see here -- how much light goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground.
Because if we look at the Earth the way it should be, it would be something like this very inspiring image where darkness is for our imagination and for contemplation and to help us to relate to everything.
The world is changing though, and urbanization is a big driver of everything.
I took this photo two weeks ago in Guangzhou, and I realized that 10 years ago, there was nothing like this, of these buildings.
It was just a much smaller city, and the pace of urbanization is incredible and enormous.
And we have to understand these main questions: How do people move through these new urban spaces?
How do they share their culture?
How do we tackle things like mobility?
And how can light help there?
Because the new technologies, they seem to be in a really interesting position to contribute to the solutions of urbanization and to provide us with better environments.
It's not that long ago that our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps.
And of course, we had the metal halide lamps and fluorescent lamps Now we have LED, but here you see the latest one, and you see how incredibly small it is.
And this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity because this tiny, tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it.
And we can actually leave it out where it's not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness.
So that is a really interesting proposition, I think, and a new way of lighting the architectural environment with our well-being in mind.
The problem is though that I wanted to explain to you how this really works -- but I can have four of these on my finger, so you would not to be able to really see them.
So I asked our laboratory to do something about it, and they said, "Well, we can do something."
They created for me the biggest LED in the world especially for TEDx in Amsterdam.
So here it is.
It's the same thing as you can see over there -- just 200 times bigger.
And I will very quickly show you how it works.
So just to explain.
Now, every LED that is made these days gives blue light.
Now this is not very pleasant and comfortable.
And for that reason, we cover the LED with a phosphor cap.
And the phosphor is excited by the blue and makes the light white and warm and pleasant.
And then when you add the lens to that, you can bundle the light and send it to wherever you need it without any need to spill any light to the sky or anywhere else.
So you can preserve the darkness and make the light.
I just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works.
Thank you.
We can go further.
So we have to rethink the way we light our cities.
We have to think again about light as a default solution.
Why are all these motorways permanently lit?
Is it really needed?
Can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness?
Can we be more gentle with light?
Like here -- this is a very low light level actually.
Can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create, so they really want to connect with it, like here?
Or can we create simply sculptures that are very inspiring to be in and to be around?
And can we preserve the darkness?
Because to find a place like this today on Earth is really very, very challenging.
And to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult.
Even in the oceans, we are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for animal life to have a much greater well-being.
And it's known that migrating birds, for example, get very disoriented because of these offshore platforms.
And we discovered that, when we make those lights green, the birds, they actually go the right way.
They are not disturbed anymore.
And it turns out once again that spectral sensitivity is very important here.
In all of these examples, I think, we should start making the light out of darkness, and use the darkness as a canvas -- like the visual artists do, like Edward Hopper in this painting.
I think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting.
I think, when I see it, I start to think, who are those people?
Where have they come from? Where are they going?
What just happened? What will be happening in the next five minutes?
And it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light.
Edward Hopper was a real master in creating the narration by working with light and dark.
And we can learn from that and create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments.
We can do that in commercial spaces like this.
And you can still also go outside and enjoy the greatest show in the universe, which is, of course, the universe itself.
So I give you this wonderful, informative image of the sky, ranging from the inner city, where you may see one or two stars and nothing else, all the way to the rural environments, where you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance of the constellations and the stars.
In architecture, it works just the same.
By appreciating the darkness when you design the light, you create much more interesting environments that truly enhance our lives.
This is the most well-known example, Tadao Ando's Church of Light.
But I also think of Peter Zumthor's spa in Vals, where light and dark, in very gentle combinations, alter each other to define the space.
Or Richard McCormack's Southern tube station in London, where you can really see the sky, even though you are under the ground.
And finally I want to point out that a lot of this inspiration comes from theater.
And I think it's fantastic that we are today experiencing TEDx in a theater for the first time because I think we really owe to the theater a big thanks.
It wouldn't be such an inspiring scenography without this theater.
And I think the theater is a place where we truly enhance life with light.
Thank you very much.

<title>Rogier van der Heide: Why light needs darkness</title>
<description>Lighting architect Rogier van der Heide offers a beautiful new way to look at the world -- by paying attention to light . Examples from classic buildings illustrate a deeply thought-out vision of the play of light around us. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/anil_gupta_india_s_hidden_hotbeds_of_invention.html</url>
I bring to you a message from tens of thousands of people -- in the villages, in the slums, in the hinterland of the country -- who have solved problems through their own genius, without any outside help.
When our home minister announces a few weeks ago a war on one third of India, about 200 districts that he mentioned were ungovernable, he missed the point.
The point that we have been stressing for the last 21 years, the point that people may be economically poor, but they're not poor in the mind.
In other words, the minds on the margin are not the marginal minds.
That is the message, which we started 31 years ago.
And what did it start?
Let me just tell you, briefly, my personal journey, which led me to come to this point.
In '85, '86, I was in Bangladesh advising the government and the research council there how to help scientists work on the lands, on the fields of the poor people, and how to develop research technologies, which are based on the knowledge of the people.
I came back in '86.
I had been tremendously invigorated by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country, which had 60 percent landlessness but amazing creativity.
I started looking at my own work: The work that I had done for the previous 10 years, almost every time, that people had shared.
Now, I was paid in dollars as a consultant, and I looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself: "Is there a line in my return, which shows how much of this income has gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible?
Was it because I'm brilliant that I'm getting this reward, or because of the revolution?
Is it that I write very well?
Is it that I articulate very well?
Is it that I analyze the data very well?
Is it because I'm a professor, and, therefore, I must be entitled to this reward from society?"
I tried to convince myself that, "No, no, I have worked for the policy changes.
You know, the public policy will become more responsive to the needs of the poor, and, therefore I think it's okay."
But it appeared to me that all these years that I'd been working on exploitation -- exploitation by landlords, by moneylenders, by traders -- gave me an insight that probably I was also an exploiter, because there was no line in my income tax return which showed this income accrued because of the brilliance of the people -- those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me -- and nothing ever went back to them.
So much so, that much of my work till that time was in the English language.
The majority of the people from whom I learned didn't know English.
So what kind of a contributor was I?
I was talking about social justice, and here I was, a professional who was pursuing the most unjust act -- of taking knowledge from the people, making them anonymous, getting rent from that knowledge by sharing it and doing consultancy, writing papers and publishing them in the papers, getting invited to the conferences, getting consultancies and whatever have you.
So then, a dilemma rose in the mind that, if I'm also an exploiter, then this is not right; life cannot go on like that.
And this was a moment of great pain and trauma because I couldn't live with it any longer.
So I did a review of ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research, wrote, read about 100 papers.
And I came to the conclusion that while dilemma is unique, dilemma is not unique; the solution had to be unique.
And one day -- I don't know what happened -- while coming back from the office towards home, maybe I saw a honey bee or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee, life would be wonderful.
What the honey bee does: it pollinates, takes nectar from the flower, pollinates another flower, cross-pollinates.
And when it takes the nectar, the flowers don't feel shortchanged.
In fact, they invite the honey bees through their colors, and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves.
These are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network: that whenever we learn something from people it must be shared with them in their language.
They must not remain anonymous.
And I must tell you that after 20 years, I have not made one percent of change in the professional practice of this art.
That is a great tragedy -- which I'm carrying still with me and I hope that all of you will carry this with you -- that the profession still legitimizes publication of knowledge of people without attributing them by making them anonymous.
The research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences or Research Councils of the U.K.
or of Indian Councils of Science Research do not require that whatever you learn from people, you must share back with them.
We are talking about an accountable society, a society that is fair and just, and we don't even do justice in the knowledge market.
And India wants to be a knowledge society.
How will it be a knowledge society?
So, obviously, you cannot have two principles of justice, one for yourself and one for others.
It must be the same.
You cannot discriminate.
You cannot be in favor of your own values, which are at a distance from the values that you espouse.
So, fairness to one and to the other is not divisible.
Look at this picture.
Can you tell me where has it been taken from, and what is it meant for? Anybody?
I'm a professor; I must quiz you.
Anybody? Any guess at all?
Pardon?
Anil Gupta: But what has it been used for? What has it been used for?
Pardon?
You know, you're so right. We must give him a hand, because this man knows how insensitive our government is.
Look at this. This is the site of the government of India.
It invites tourists to see the shame of our country.
I'm so sorry to say that.
Is this a beautiful picture or is it a terrible picture?
It depends upon how you look at the life of the people.
If this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles, you cannot be celebrating that.
We should be doing something about it.
And let me tell you, with all the science and technology at our command, millions of women still carry water on their heads.
And we do not ask this question.
You must have taken tea in the morning.
Think for a minute.
The leaves of the tea, plucked from the bushes; you know what the action is? The action is: The lady picks up a few leaves, puts them in the basket on the backside.
Just do it 10 times; you will realize the pain in this shoulder.
And she does it a few thousand times every day.
The rice that you ate in the lunch, and you will eat today, is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture, millions of them, every season, in the paddy season, when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water.
And feet in the water will develop fungus, infections, and that infection pains because then other insects bite that point.
And every year, 99.9 percent of the paddy is transplanted manually.
No machines have been developed.
So the silence of scientists, of technologists, of public policy makers, of the change agent, drew our attention that this is not on, this is not on; this is not the way society will work.
This is not what our parliament would do. You know, we have a program for employment: One hundred, 250 million people have to be given jobs for 100 days by this great country.
Doing what? Breaking stones, digging earth.
So we asked a question to the parliament: Do poor have heads?
Do poor have legs, mouth and hands, but no head?
So Honey Bee Network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich.
And what has happened?
An anonymous, faceless, nameless person gets in contact with the network, and then gets an identity.
This is what Honey Bee Network is about.
And this network grew voluntarily, continues to be voluntary, and has tried to map the minds of millions of people of our country and other parts of the world who are creative.
They could be creative in terms of education, they may be creative in terms of culture, they may be creative in terms of institutions; but a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity, the innovations, either in terms of contemporary innovations, or in terms of traditional knowledge.
And it all begins with curiosity.
It all begins with curiosity.
This person, whom we met -- and you will see it on the website, www.sristi.org -- this tribal person, he had a wish.
And he said, "If my wish gets fulfilled" -- somebody was sick and he had to monitor -- "God, please cure him.
And if you cure him, I will get my wall painted."
And this is what he got painted.
Somebody was talking yesterday about Maslowian hierarchy.
There could be nothing more wrong than the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment.
Kabir, Rahim, all the great Sufi saints, they were all poor people, and they had a great reason.
Please do not ever think that only after meeting your physiological needs and other needs can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment.
Any person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment, only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something.
Look at this.
We saw it in Shodh Yatra. Every six months we walk in different parts of the country.
I've walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years.
So on the wayside we found these dung cakes, which are used as a fuel.
Now, this lady, on the wall of the dung cake heap, has made a painting.
That's the only space she could express her creativity.
And she's so marvelous.
Look at this lady, Ram Timari Devi, on a grain bin. In Champaran, we had a Shodh Yatra and we were walking in the land where Gandhiji went to hear about the tragedy, pain of indigo growers.
Bhabi Mahato in Purulia and Bankura.
Look at what she has done.
The whole wall is her canvas. She's sitting there with a broom.
Is she an artisan or an artist?
Obviously she's an artist; she's a creative person.
If we can create markets for these artists, we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones.
They will be paid for what they are good at, not what they're bad at.
Look at what Rojadeen has done.
In Motihari in Champaran, there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack and, obviously, there's a limited market for tea.
Every morning you have tea, as well as coffee.
So he thought, why don't I convert a pressure cooker into a coffee machine?
So this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees.
People bring their own cooker, he attaches a valve and a steam pipe, and now he gives you espresso coffee.
Now, this is a real, affordable coffee percolator that works on gas.
Look at what Sheikh Jahangir has done.
A lot of poor people do not have enough grains to get ground.
So this fellow is bringing a flour-grinding machine on a two-wheeler.
If you have 500 grams, 1000, one kilogram, he will grind it for it for you; the flourmill will not grind such a small quantity.
Please understand the problem of poor people.
They have needs which have to be met efficiently in terms of energy, in terms of cost, in terms of quality.
They don't want second-standard, second-quality outputs.
But to be able to give them high-quality output you need to adapt technology to their needs.
And that is what Sheikh Jahangir did.
But that's not enough, what he did. Look at what he did here.
If you have clothes, and you don't have enough time to wash them, he brought a washing machine to your doorstep, mounted on a two-wheeler.
So here's a model where a two-wheeler washing machine ...
He is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep.
You bring your water, you bring your soap, I wash the clothes for you. Charge 50 paisa, one rupee for you per lot, and a new business model can emerge.
Now, what we need is, we need people who will be able to scale them up.
Look at this.
It looks like a beautiful photograph.
But you know what it is? Can anybody guess what it is?
Somebody from India would know, of course.
It's a tawa.
It's a hot plate made of clay.
Now, what is the beauty in it?
When you have a non-stick pan, it costs about, maybe, 250 rupees, five dollars, six dollars.
This is less than a dollar and this is non-stick; it is coated with one of these food-grade materials.
And the best part is that, while you use a costly non-stick pan, you eat the so-called Teflon or Teflon-like material because after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone?
It has gone in your stomach. It was not meant for that.
You know? But here in this clay hot plate, it will never go into your stomach.
So it is better, it is safer; it is affordable, it is energy-efficient.
In other words, solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper, need not be, so-called, jugaad, need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement.
They have to be better, they have to be more efficient, they have to be affordable.
And that is what Mansukh Bhai Prajapati has done.
He has designed this plate with a handle.
And now with one dollar, you can afford a better alternative than the people market is offering you.
This lady, she developed a herbal pesticide formulation.
We filed the patent for her, the National Innovation Foundation.
And who knows? Somebody will license this technology and develop marketable products, and she would get revenue.
Now, let me mention one thing: I think we need a polycentric model of development, where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country, in different parts of the world, would solve the needs of locality in a very efficient and adaptive manner.
Higher the local fit, greater is the chance of scaling up.
In the scaling up, there's an inherent inadequacy to match the needs of the local people, point by point, with the supply that you're making.
So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch?
Things can scale up, and they have scaled up.
For example, cell phones: We have 400 million cellphones in this country.
Now, it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone, only three options on the cellphone.
It has 300 options, I'm paying for 300; I'm using only three but I'm willing to live with it, therefore it is scaling up.
But if I had to get a match to match, obviously, I would need a different design of a cellphone.
So what we're saying is that scalability should not become an enemy of sustainability.
There must be a place in the world for solutions that are only relevant for a locality, and yet, one can be able to fund them.
One of the greatest studies that we've been finding is that many times investors would ask this question -- "What is a scalable model?" -- as if the need of a community, which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places, has no legitimate right to get them for free because it's not part of a larger scale.
So either you sub-optimize your needs to a larger scale or else you remain out.
Now, the eminent model, the long-tail model tells you that small sales of a large number of books, for example, having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model.
And we must find a mechanism where people will pool in the portfolio, will invest in the portfolio, where different innovations will go to a small number of people in their localities, and yet, the overall platform of the model will become viable.
Look at what he is doing.
Saidullah Sahib is an amazing man.
At the age of 70, he is linking up something very creative.
Saidullah Sahib: I couldn't wait for the boat.
I had to meet my love.
My desperation made me an innovator.
Even love needs help from technology.
Innovation is the light of my wife, Noor.
New inventions are the passion of my life.
My technology.
AG: Saidulluh Sahib is in Motihari, again in Champaran.
Wonderful human being, but he stills sells, at this age, honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood, because we haven't been able to convince the water park people, the lake people, in [unclear] operations.
And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people in Mumbai -- where there was a flood a few years ago and people had to walk 20 kilometers, wading in the water -- that, look, you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office because you can then go to those lanes where your buses will not go, where your transport will not go.
So we have not yet cracked the problem of making it available as a rescue device, as a vending device during the floods in eastern India, when you have to deliver things to people in different islands where they're marooned.
But the idea has a merit. The idea has a merit.
What has Appachan done? Appachan, unfortunately, is no more, but he has left behind a message.
A very powerful message Appachan: I watch the world wake up every day.
It's not that a coconut fell on my head, and I came upon this idea.
With no money to fund my studies, I scaled new heights.
Now, they call me the local Spiderman.
My technology.
AG: Many of you might not realize and believe that we have sold this product internationally -- what I call a G2G model, grassroots to global.
And a professor in the University of Massachusetts, in the zoology department, bought this climber because she wanted to study the insect diversity of the top of the tree canopy.
And this device makes it possible for her to take samples from a larger number of palms, rather than only a few, because otherwise she had to make a big platform and then climb her [unclear] would climb on that.
So, you know, we are advancing the frontiers of science.
Remya Jose has developed ...
you can go to the YouTube and find India Innovates and then you will find these videos.
Innovation by her when she was in class 10th: a washing machine-cum-exercising machine.
Mr. Kharai who is a physically challenged person, one and a half foot height, only.
But he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and flexibility.
This innovation is from the slums of Rio.
And this person, Mr. Ubirajara.
We were talking about, my friends in Brazil, how we scale up this model in China and Brazil.
And we have a very vibrant network in China, particularly, but also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world.
This stand on the front wheel, you will not find on any cycle.
India and China have the largest number of cycles.
But this innovation emerged in Brazil.
The point is, none of us should be parochial, none of us should be so nationalistic to believe that all good ideas will come only from our country.
No, we have to have the humility to learn from knowledge of economically poor people, wherever they are.
And look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations: cycle that's a sprayer, cycle that generates energy from the shocks on the road.
I can't change the condition of the road, but I can make the cycle run faster.
That is what Kanak Das has done.
And in South Africa, we had taken our innovators, and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa as to how innovation can become a means of liberation from the drudgery that people have.
And this is a donkey cart which they modified.
There's an axle here, of 30, 40 kg, serving no purpose.
Remove it, the cart needs one donkey less.
This is in China. This girl needed a breathing apparatus.
These three people in the village sat down and decided to think, "How do we elongate the life of this girl of our village?"
They were not related to her, but they tried to find out, "How can we use ... " They used a cycle, they put together a breathing apparatus.
And this breathing apparatus now saved the life, and she's very welcome.
There's a whole range of innovations that we have.
A car, which runs on compressed air with six paisa per kilometer.
Assam, Kanak Gogoi.
And you would not find this car in U.S. or Europe, but this is available in India.
Now, this lady, she used to do the winding of the yarn for Pochampally Saree.
In one day, 18,000 times, she had to do this winding to generate two sarees.
This is what her son has done after seven years of struggle.
She said, "Change your profession."
He said, "I can't. This is the only thing I know, but I'll invent a machine, which will solve your problem."
And this is what he did, a sewing machine in Uttar Pradesh.
So, this is what SRISTI is saying: "Give me a place to stand, and I will move the world."
I will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children for creativity, a whole range of things.
We have sold things all over the world, from Ethiopia to Turkey to U.S. to wherever.
Products have gone to the market, a few.
These are the people whose knowledge made this Herbavate cream for eczema possible.
And here, a company which licensed this herbal pesticide put a photograph of the innovator on the packing so that every time a user uses it, it asks the user, "You can also be an innovator.
If you have an idea, send it back to us."
So, creativity counts, knowledge matters, innovations transform, incentives inspire.
And incentives: not just material, but also non-material incentives.
Thank you.

<title>Anil Gupta: India's hidden hotbeds of invention</title>
<description>Anil Gupta is on the hunt for the developing world's unsung inventors -- indigenous entrepreneurs whose ingenuity, hidden by poverty, could change many people's lives. He shows how the Honey Bee Network helps them build the connections they need -- and gain the recognition they deserve.</description>
<keywords>creativity,entrepreneur,innovation,invention,poverty</keywords>
<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/dean_kamen_on_inventing_and_giving.html</url>
As you pointed out, every time you come here, you learn something.
This morning, the world's experts from I guess three or four different companies on building seats, I think concluded that ultimately, the solution is, people shouldn't sit down.
I could have told them that.
Yesterday, the automotive guys gave us some new insights.
They pointed out that, I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today, they will be steering cars by wire, without all that mechanical stuff.
That's reassuring.
They then pointed out that there'd be, sort of, the other controls by wire, to get rid of all that mechanical stuff.
That's pretty good, but why not get rid of the wires?
Then you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it.
I would love to talk about the technology, and sometime, in what's past the 15 minutes, I'll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here about what's in here.
But if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first, it would be that from the time we started building this, the big idea wasn't the technology.
It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the iBOT for the disabled community.
The big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation.
And maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this, I'll be happy to give it to you in different forms.
You never know what strikes the fancy of whom, but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world.
And Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts.
What I don't think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied.
For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns.
So, the car -- the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal; it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage.
It was half as long.
And it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance, in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan, because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses, and a million of them urinating and doing other things, and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable.
So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy.
It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm, or their farm to a town, or from a town to a city.
It all made sense, with 91 percent of the people living there.
By the 1950s, we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world, the highway system.
And it is certainly a wonder.
And by the way, as I take shots at old technologies, I want to assure everybody, and particularly the automotive industry -- who's been very supportive of us -- that I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes, or cars.
But think about where the world is today.
50 percent of the global population now lives in cities.
That's 3.2 billion people.
We've solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today.
500 years ago, sailing ships started getting reliable enough; we found a new continent.
150 years ago, locomotives got efficient enough, steam power, that we turned the continent into a country.
Over the last hundred years, we started building cars, and then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way, and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that.
But during that entire process, more and more people have been born, and more and more people are moving to cities.
China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half.
And so, nobody, I think, would argue that airplanes, in the last 50 years, have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood.
And if you just look at how technology has been applied, we've solved all the long-range, high-speed, high-volume, large-weight problems of moving things around.
Nobody would want to give them up.
And I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane, or my helicopter, or my Humvee, or my Porsche.
I love them all. I don't keep any of them in my living room.
The fact is, the last mile is the problem, and half the world now lives in dense cities.
And people spend, depending on who they are, between 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot.
I think there's -- I don't know what data would impress you, but how about, 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States.
Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air, and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices, particularly sitting in cities.
And again, I say that not to attack any industry, I think -- I really do -- I love my airplane, and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient, both from an engineering point of view, an energy consumption point of view, and a utility point of view.
And we all love our cars, and I do.
The problem is, you get into the city and you want to go four blocks, it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive.
It's not sustainable.
If -- in China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles; 1.7 million people used cars.
If five percent of that population became, quote, middle class, and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks -- it isn't sustainable environmentally; it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil -- and it's not sustainable politically.
I mean, what are we fighting over right now?
We can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over right now?
So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile, and it was dumb luck. We were working on iBOTs, but once we made this, we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis. You don't need the water.
Or snowmobiles. You don't need the snow.
Or skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things.
And every one of those industries, by the way -- just golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry.
But rather than go license this off, which is what we normally do, it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology, but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems, but has somehow come to accept that cities -- which, right back from ancient Greece on, were meant to walk around, cities that were architected and built for people -- now have a footprint that, while we've solved every other transportation problem -- and it's like Moore's law.
I mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon, then on a railroad, then an airplane.
Every other form of transportation's been improved.
In 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities.
They've gotten bigger; they're spread out.
The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city -- Wilshire Boulevard, or Fifth Avenue, or Tokyo, or Paris -- the most expensive real estate is their downtowns.
65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars.
The 20 largest cities in the world.
So you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities?
What if you could make them fun, attractive, clean, environmentally friendly?
What if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this, as that last link to mass transit, to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want, and then have our cities energized again?
We thought it would be really neat to do that, and one of the problems we really were worried about is: how do we get legal on the sidewalk?
Because technically I've got motors; I've got wheels -- I'm a motor vehicle.
I don't look like a motor vehicle.
I have the same footprint as a pedestrian; I have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space.
I took this down to Ground Zero, and knocked my way through crowds for an hour.
I'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two, and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices.
We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter, and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff.
Or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle.
We've been so concerned about that, we went to the Postmaster General of the United States, as the first person we ever showed on the outside, and said, "Put your people on it. Everybody trusts their postman.
And they belong on the sidewalks, and they'll use it seriously."
He agreed. We went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat, carrying 70 pounds of stuff. They love it.
And I can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket.
So we've been working really, really hard, but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what's important, and how to apply the technology.
We went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to let us design and build these things, and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted.
So, I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want.
And yes, it's really fun, and yes, you should all go out and try it.
But if I could ask you to do one thing, it's not to think about it as a piece of technology, but just imagine that, although we all understand somehow that it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine, which can go 60 miles an hour, that can bring you everywhere you want to go, and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile, and it's broken, and it doesn't work.
One of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted, happened out here in California.
A few weeks ago, after we launched it, we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach, zipping up and back, and he's marveling at the technology, and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by, and skateboarders are zipping by, and a little old lady -- I mean, if you looked in the dictionary, a little old lady -- came by me -- and now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now -- and she just stops, and the camera is there, and she looks up at me and says, "Can I try that?"
And what was I -- you know, how are you going to say anything?
And so I said, "Sure."
So I get off, and she gets on, and with a little bit of the usual, ah, then she turns around, and she goes about 20 feet, and she turns back around, and she's all smiles.
And she comes back to me and she stops, and she says, "Finally, they made something for us."
And the camera is looking down at her.
I'm thinking, "Wow, that was great -- -- please lady, don't say another word."
And the camera is down at her, and this guy has to put the microphone in her face, said, "What do you mean by that?"
And I figured, "It's all over now," and she looks up and she says, "Well," she's still watching these guys go; she says, "I can't ride a bike," no, she says, "I can't use a skateboard, and I've never used roller blades," she knew them by name; she says, "And it's been 50 years since I rode a bicycle."
Then she looks up, she's looking up, and she says, "And I'm 81 years old, and I don't drive a car anymore.
I still have to get to the store, and I can't carry a lot of things."
And it suddenly occurred to me, that among my many fears, were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it -- it was that, fundamentally, you believe there's pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left, the sidewalks in these cities.
When you look at the 36 inches of legal requirement for sidewalk, then the eight foot for the parked car, then the three lanes, and then the other eight feet -- it's -- that little piece is all that's there.
But she looks up and says this, and it occurs to me, well, kids aren't going to mind these things, and they don't vote, and business people and then young adults aren't going to mind these things -- they're pretty cool -- so I guess subliminally I was worried that it's the older population that's going to worry.
So, having seen this, and having worried about it for eight years, the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys, call AARP, get an appointment right away.
We've got to show them this thing.
And they took it to Washington; they showed them; and they're going to be involved now, watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities, like Atlanta, where we're doing trials to see if it really can, in fact, help re-energize their downtown.
The bottom line is, whether you believe the United Nations, or any of the other think tanks -- in the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planet will be in cities.
In Asia alone, it will be over a billion people.
They learned to start with cell phones.
They didn't have to take the 100-year trip we took.
They start at the top of the technology food chain.
We've got to start building cities and human environments where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense, rich, green-space environment, without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it.
Cars were not meant for parallel parking; they're wonderful machines to go between cities, but just think about it: we've solved all the long-range, high-speed problems.
The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals.
You do it in your sneakers.
Not much has changed.
If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times -- a 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes.
Your choice, when living in a city, if it's now 10 minutes -- because at 30 minutes you want an alternative, whether it's a bus, a train -- we've got to build an infrastructure -- a light rail -- or you're going to keep parking those cars.
But if you could put a pin in most cities, and imagine how far you could, if you had the time, walk in one half-hour, it's the city.
If you could make it fun, and make it eight or 10 minutes, you can't find your car, un-park your car, move your car, re-park your car and go somewhere; you can't get to a cab or a subway.
We could change the way people allocate their resources, the way this planet uses its energy, make it more fun.
And we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right.
That's Segway. This is a Stirling cycle engine; this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing.
This little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity.
Yes, it could be attached to this, and yes, on a kilogram of propane, you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose.
Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it'll burn any fuel, because some of you might be skeptical about the capability of this to have an impact, where most of the world you can't simply plug into your 120-volt outlet.
We've been working on this, actually, as an alternative energy source, starting way back with Johnson &amp; Johnson, to run an iBOT, because the best batteries you could get -- 10 watt-hours per kilogram in lead, 20 watt-hours per kilogram nickel-cadmium, 40 watt-hours per kilogram in nickel-metal hydride, 60 watt-hours per kilogram in lithium, 8,750 watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline -- which is why nobody drives electric cars.
But, in any event, if you can burn it with the same efficiency -- because it's external combustion -- as your kitchen stove, if you can burn any fuel, it turns out to be pretty neat.
It makes just enough electricity to, for instance, do this, which at night is enough electricity, in the rest of the world, as Mr. Holly -- Dr. Holly -- pointed out, can run computers and a light bulb.
But more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say, you're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency.
It doesn't matter much -- it says if you get 200 watts of electricity, you'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat.
If you wanted to boil water and re-condense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour, it takes about 25, a little over 25.3 kilowatt -- 25,000 watts of continuous power -- to do it.
That's so much energy, you couldn't afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way.
Certainly, in the rest of the world, your choice is to devastate the place, turning everything that will burn into heat, or drink the water that's available.
The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water.
Depending on whose numbers you believe, it's between 60 and 85,000 people per day.
We don't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world.
We need water.
And women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it, or watching their kids die.
We figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing, with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat, then using a little bit of the electricity control that process, and for 450 watts, which is a little more than half of its waste heat, it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it.
So if we put this box on here in a few years, could we have a solution to transportation, electricity, and communication, and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds?
I don't know, but we'll try it.
I better shut up.

I'd like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo, who was put to sleep a couple of days ago, because he got too old.
But apparently he was a very nice dog and he always let the cat sleep in the dog bed.
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. I'm just a'walking my dog, singing my song, strolling along. Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong. My life was lonely and blue. Yeah, I was sad as a sailor, I was an angry 'un too. Then there was you -- appeared when I was entangled with youth and fear, and nerves jingle jangled, vermouth and beer were getting me mangled up. But then I looked in your eyes and I was no more a failure. You looked so wacky and wise. And I said, "Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I'm just a'walking my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong." Yeah, it's just me and my dog, singing our song, strolling along. 'Cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt, and I don't care what the politicians spout. If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound, and find yourself a hound, and make that doggie proud, 'cause that's what it's all about. Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. My life was tragic and sad. I was the archetypal loser. I was a pageant gone bad. And then there was you -- on time, and wagging your tail in the cutest mime that you was in jail. I said, "Woof, be mine!" and you gave a wail and then I was no longer alone. And I was no more a boozer. We'll make the happiest home. And I said, "Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I'm just a'walking my dog, singing my song, strolling along." Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun.

In December of 2010, the city of Apatzingán in the coastal state of Michoacán, in Mexico, awoke to gunfire.
For two straight days, the city became an open battlefield between the federal forces and a well-organized group, presumably from the local criminal organization, La Familia Michoacana, or the Michoacán family.
The citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire but also explosions and burning trucks used as barricades across the city, so truly like a battlefield.
After these two days, and during a particularly intense encounter, it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana, Nazario Moreno, was killed.
In response to this terrifying violence, the mayor of Apatzingán decided to call the citizens to a march for peace.
The idea was to ask for a softer approach to criminal activity in the state.
And so, the day of the scheduled procession, thousands of people showed up.
As the mayor was preparing to deliver the speech starting the march, his team noticed that, while half of the participants were appropriately dressed in white, and bearing banners asking for peace, the other half was actually marching in support of the criminal organization and its now-presumed-defunct leader.
Shocked, the mayor decided to step aside rather than participate or lead a procession that was ostensibly in support of organized crime.
And so his team stepped aside.
The two marches joined together, and they continued their path towards the state capital.
This story of horrific violence followed by a fumbled approach by federal and local authorities as they tried to engage civil society, who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization, is a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today, where we see that our current understanding of drug violence and what leads to it is probably at the very least incomplete.
If you decided to spend 30 minutes trying to figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico by, say, just researching online, the first thing you would find out is that while the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal, there are some that are more and there are some that are much less equal than others, because you will quickly find out that in the past six years anywhere between 60 and 100,000 people have lost their lives in drug-related violence.
To put these numbers in perspective, this is eight times larger than the number of casualties in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.
It's also shockingly close to the number of people who have died in the Syrian civil war, which is an active civil war.
This is happening just south of the border.
Now as you're reading, however, you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly become numb to the numbers of deaths, because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers of faceless, nameless dead people.
Implicitly or explicitly, there is a narrative that all the people who are dying were somehow involved in the drug trade, and we infer this because they were either tortured or executed in a professional manner, or, most likely, both.
And so clearly they were criminals because of the way they died.
And so the narrative is that somehow these people got what they were deserved.
They were part of the bad guys.
And that creates some form of comfort for a lot of people.
However, while it's easier to think of us, the citizens, the police, the army, as the good guys, and them, the narcos, the carteles, as the bad guys, if you think about it, the latter are only providing a service to the former.
Whether we like it or not, the U.S. is the largest market for illegal substances in the world, accounting for more than half of global demand.
It shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico that is its only route of access from the South, and so, as the former dictator of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz, used to say, "Poor Mexico, so far from God and so close to the United States."
The U.N. estimates that there are 55 million users of illegal drugs in the United States.
Using very, very conservative assumptions, this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side of anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars.
If we assume that the narcos only have access to the wholesale part, which we know is false, that still leaves you with yearly revenues of anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars.
To put these numbers in perspective, Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.
And it so happens that this is a product that, because of its nature, a business model to address this market requires you to guarantee to your producers that their product will be reliably placed in the markets where it is consumed.
And the only way to do this, because it's illegal, is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors that are used to transport drugs.
Hence the violence.
If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence, you will see that it almost perfectly aligns with the most efficient routes of transportation from the south to the north.
is that they're trying to protect their business.
It's not only a multi-billion dollar market, but it's also a complex one.
For example, the coca plant is a fragile plant that can only grow in certain latitudes, and so it means that a business model to address this market requires you to have decentralized, international production, that by the way needs to have good quality control, because people need a good high that is not going to kill them and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it.
And so that means they need to secure production and quality control in the south, and you need to ensure that you have efficient and effective distribution channels in the markets where these drugs are consumed.
I urge you, but only a little bit, because I don't want to get you in trouble, to just ask around and see how difficult it would be to get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it, whenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S., and some of you may be surprised to know that there are many dealers that offer a service where if you send them a text message, they guarantee delivery of the drug in 30 minutes or less.
Think about this for a second.
Think about the complexity of the distribution network that I just described.
It's very difficult to reconcile this with the image of faceless, ignorant goons that are just shooting each other, very difficult to reconcile.
Now, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you, an effective organization requires an integrated strategy that includes a good organizational structure, good incentives, a solid identity and good brand management.
This leads me to the second thing that you would learn in your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico.
Because you would quickly realize, and maybe be confused by the fact, that there are three organizations that are constantly named in the articles.
You will hear about Los Zetas, the Knights Templar, which is the new brand for the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning, and the Sinaloa Federation.
You will read that Los Zetas is this assortment of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter and they silence the press, and this is somewhat true, or mostly true.
But this is the result of a very careful branding and business strategy.
You see, Los Zetas is not just this random assortment of individuals, but was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel, that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico.
When that corridor became contested, they decided that they wanted to recruit a professional enforcement arm.
So they recruited Los Zetas: an entire unit of elite paratroopers from the Mexican Army.
They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel, so much so that at some point, they decided to just take over the operations, which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets, because they grow up.
Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason, they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution in the most profitable markets like cocaine, but what they did have, and this is again based on their military origin, was a perfectly structured chain of command with a very clear hierarchy and a very clear promotion path that allowed them to supervise and operate across many, many markets very effectively, which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do.
And so because they didn't have access to the more profitable drug markets, this pushed them and gave them the opportunity to diversify into other forms of crime.
That includes kidnapping, prostitution, local drug dealing and human trafficking, including of migrants that go from the south to the U.S.
So what they currently run is truly and quite literally a franchise business.
They focus most of their recruiting on the army, and they very openly advertise for better salaries, better benefits, better promotion paths, not to mention much better food, than what the army can deliver.
The way they operate is that when they arrive in a locality, they let people know that they are there, and they go to the most powerful local gang and they say, "I offer you to be the local representative of the Zeta brand."
If they agree -- and you don't want to know what happens if they don't -- they train them and they supervise them on how to run the most efficient criminal operation for that town, in exchange for royalties.
This kind of business model obviously depends entirely on having a very effective brand of fear, and so Los Zetas carefully stage acts of violence that are spectacular in nature, especially when they arrive first in a city, but again, that's just a brand strategy.
I'm not saying they're not violent, but what I am saying is that even though you will read that they are the most violent of all, when you count, when you do the body count, they're actually all the same.
In contrast to them, the Knights Templar that arose in Michoacán emerged in reaction to the incursion of the Zetas into the state of Michoacán.
Michoacán is a geographically strategic state because it has one of the largest ports in Mexico, and it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico, which then gives you direct access to the U.S.
The Knights Templar realized very quickly that they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone, and so they developed a strategy as a social enterprise.
They brand themselves as representative of and protecting of the citizens of Michoacán against organized crime.
Their brand of social enterprise means that they require a lot of civic engagement, so they invest heavily in providing local services, like dealing with home violence, going after petty criminals, treating addicts, and keeping drugs out of the local markets where they are, and, of course, protecting people from other criminal organizations.
Now, they kill a lot of people too, but when they kill them, they provide very careful narratives and descriptions for why they did them, through newspaper insertions, YouTube videos, and billboards that explain that the people who were killed were killed because they represented a threat not to us, as an organization, of course, but to you, as citizens.
And so we're actually here to protect you.
They, as social enterprises do, have created a moral and ethical code that they advertise around, and they have very strict recruiting practices.
And here you have the types of explanations that they provide for some of their actions.
They have actually retained access to the profitable drug trade, but the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoacán, and they control the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas, they leverage that to, for example, trade copper from Michoacán that is legally created and legally extracted with illegal ephedrine from China which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines that they produce, and then they have partnerships with larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation that place their products in the U.S.
Finally, the Sinaloa Federation.
When you read about them, you will often read about them with an undertone of reverence and admiration, because they are the most integrated and the largest of all the Mexican organizations, and, many people argue, the world.
They started as just sort of a transport organization that specialized in smuggling between the U.S.
and the Mexican borders, but now they have grown into a truly integrated multinational that has partnerships in production in the south and partnerships in global distribution across the planet.
They have cultivated a brand of professionalism, business acumen and innovation.
They have designed new drug products and new drug processes.
They have designed narco-tunnels that go across the border, and you can see that these are not "The Shawshank Redemption" types.
They have invented narco-submarines and boats that are not detected by radar.
They have invented drones to transport drugs, catapults, you name it.
One of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation actually made it to the Forbes list.
[#701 Joaquin Guzman Loera] Like any multinational would, they have specialized and focused only in the most profitable part of the business, which is high-margin drugs like cocaine, heroine, methamphetamines.
Like any traditional Latin American multinational would, the way they control their operations is through family ties.
When they're entering a new market, they send or, if they're partnering with a new organization, they create a family tie, either through marriages or other types of ties.
Like any other multinational would, they protect their brand by outsourcing the more questionable parts of the business model, like for example, when they have to engage in violence against other criminal organizations, they recruit gangs and other smaller players to do the dirty work for them, and they try to separate their operations and their violence and be very discrete about this.
To further strengthen their brand, they actually have professional P.R. firms that shape how the press talks about them.
They have professional videographers on staff.
They have incredibly productive ties with the security organizations on both sides of the border.
And so, differences aside, what these three organizations share is on the one hand, a very clear understanding that institutions cannot be imposed from the top, but rather they are built from the bottom up one interaction at a time.
They have created extremely coherent structures that they use to show the inconsistencies in government policies.
And so what I want you to remember from this talk are three things.
is actually the result of a huge market demand and an institutional setup that forces the servicing of this market to necessitate violence to guarantee delivery routes.
The second thing I want you to remember is that these are sophisticated, coherent organizations and analyzing them and treating them as such is probably a much more useful approach.
The third thing I want you to remember is that even though we're more comfortable with this idea of "them," a set of bad guys separated from us, we are actually accomplices to them, either through our direct consumption or through our acceptance of the inconsistency between our policies of prohibition and our actual behavior of tolerance or even encouragement of consumption.
These organizations service, recruit from, and operate within our communities, so necessarily, they are much more integrated within them than we are comfortable acknowledging.
And so to me the question is not whether these dynamics will continue the way they have.
We see that the nature of this phenomenon guarantees that they will.
The question is whether we are willing to continue our support of a failed strategy based on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignorance at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young.
Thank you.

<title>Rodrigo Canales: The deadly genius of drug cartels</title>
<description>Up to 100,000 people died in drug-related violence in Mexico in the last 6 years. We might think this has nothing to do with us, but in fact we are all complicit, says Yale professor Rodrigo Canales in this unflinching talk that turns conventional wisdom about drug cartels on its head.

I'd like to speak about technology trends, which is something that many of you follow -- but we also follow, for related reasons.
Obviously, being a technology magazine, technology trends are something that we write about and need to know about.
But also it's part of being any monthly magazine -- you live in the future. And we have a long lead-time.
We have to plan issues many months in advance; we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months, nine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business.
We also, like a lot of companies, create a product that's based on technology trends.
In this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky, some entertainment. But the concept's quite the same.
And so we have to understand not only why tech's important, where it's going, but also, very importantly, when -- the timing is everything.
And it's interesting, when you look at the predictions made during the peak of the boom in the 1990s, about e-commerce, or Internet traffic, or broadband adoption, or Internet advertising, they were all right -- they were just wrong in time.
Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later.
But the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations is obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything.
You've probably seen something like this before.
This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve, which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan.
And just for fun, we put a bunch of technologies on it, to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak, or whether they were about to crash into the trough of disillusionment, or rise back in the slope of enlightenment, etc.
And this is one way to do technology forecasting: get a sense of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn.
We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important; we'll typically do it twice. Once, we want to do it first.
We want to be the first to do it, for the geeks who appreciate that, we'll catch it right there at the technology-trigger.
You can see in 1997, we put Linux on the cover.
But then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologies are going to hit the mainstream, and they're going to burst out.
And then it's time to do it again. Last year.
And that's one way that we try to time technology trends.
I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that I call my "grand unified theory of predicting the future," but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future.
It's based on the presumption, the observation even, that all important technologies go through four stages in their life -- at least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages.
And at each one of these stages, can be seen as a collision -- a collision with something else -- for example, a critical price-line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point.
And these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be, and maybe how you can do something about it.
The first is the critical price.
The first stage in a technology's advance is that it'll fall below a critical price.
After it falls below a critical price, it will tend, if it's successful, to rise above a critical mass, a penetration.
Many technologies, at that point, displace another technology, and that's another important point.
And then finally, a lot of technologies commoditize.
Towards the end of their life, they become nearly free.
Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it; it's an opportunity for the technology to change.
And even if you missed, you know, the first boom of Wi-Fi -- you know, Wi-Fi did the critical price, it did the critical mass, but hasn't done displacement yet, and hasn't done free yet -- there's still more opportunity in that.
I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this by telling the story of the DVD, which is a technology which has done all of these.
The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998, it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold.
And it started to take off. And you can see that the units started to trend up, the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off.
The next thing it hit, a year later, was critical mass. In this case, 20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household.
And what's interesting here is that something else took off along with it: home-theater units.
Suddenly you have a DVD in the house; you've got high-quality digital video; you have a reason to have a big-screen television; you have a reason for Dolby 5.1 surround-sound.
And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them, and bring the rest of your entertainment in.
What's interesting also is -- note that Netflix was founded in 1999.
Reed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment, that was an inflection point that he could do something with.
The next phase it hit was displacement.
You can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR.
And here too, you can see the implications in the world at large.
Netflix was right -- the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD in a way that the video-rental stores couldn't.
Among the DVD's many assets is that it's very small; you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply.
That gave an advantage; that was an implication of the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody.
And then finally, DVDs are approaching free.
There's a company called Apex, a no-name Chinese firm, who has, several times in the past year, been the number-one DVD seller in America. Their average price, for last year, was 48 dollars.
You're aware of the perhaps apocryphal Wal-Mart stampede over the 30-dollar DVD.
But they're getting very, very cheap, and look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper, the premium brands, the Sonys and such, are losing market share, and the no-names, the Apexes, are gaining them.
They're being commodified, and that's what happens when things go to zero. It's a tough market out there.
Now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology, these four stages of technology's life.
I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there, just technologies on our radar -- and I'll use this lens, these four, as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development.
They're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there -- they're just examples of technologies that are in each one of these periods.
But I think that the implications of them approaching these crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about.
Start with gene sequencing.
As you probably know, gene sequencing -- in a large part, because it's built on computers -- is falling in price at a kind of a Moore's Law-like level.
It is now possible -- will be possible, and if Craig Venter indeed comes today, he may tell you something about this -- to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year.
That's as opposed to billions just a few years ago.
You know, our ability to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer.
What's interesting is that at the same time, the number of genes that we're discovering is rising very quickly.
Each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test.
There will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply, if you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic.
Here's another technology that's approaching a critical price.
This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails.
In January 2000, the price was 10,000 dollars, or 27 dollars a day.
The generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere, and the effect was just dramatic on pricing.
Today it's less than 50 cents a day.
And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity, if you look at the correlation between these two, as the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treat goes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 -- two million in sub-Saharan Africa.
And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that.
Linux is another good example.
Now we've switched to critical mass.
These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass.
If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent.
Interestingly, it's done a crossover before, but not the crossovers that matter.
The crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue.
But you can look and see the direction those lines are going, you can see that at the 20 percent, it's now taken seriously.
It's not just for the geeks any more.
That is, I imagine, what people in Redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about.
Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars.
I don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic.
And if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 -- and I don't think this is a crazy forecast -- they'll be two percent of auto sales.
Two percent isn't 20 percent, but in the car business, which is slow moving, that's huge; that's arrival.
At two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere.
And what's interesting about the hybrids taking off is you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry.
It's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years.
And once you have electric motors, you can do anything: you can change the structure of the car in any way you want.
You can have regenerative braking; you can have drive-by-wire; you can have replaceable body shapes -- it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid, but it can lead to a whole new era of the car.
Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about.
Again, it's kind of coming out of nowhere; it's a little hard to use right now.
There's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype.
Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year; they already have nearly four million registered users -- that's critical mass.
And the same thing's happening on the carrier side.
You're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional telecom standards. This is a tipping point -- if Malcolm's here, forgive me -- and it's going to change the economics, and the speed, and the players in the industry.
It's going to look a little bit like that.
And finally, free. Free is really, really interesting.
Free is something that comes with digital, because the reproduction costs are essentially free. It comes with IP, because it's such an efficient protocol. It comes with fiber optics, because there's so much bandwidth.
Free is really, you know, the gift of Silicon Valley to the world.
It's an economic force; it's a technical force.
It's a deflationary force, if not handled right.
It is abundance, as opposed to scarcity.
Free is probably the most interesting thing.
And here you have just the number of songs that can be stored on a hard drive.
You know, there could be a film's [unclear] there, but it's basically, every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element, the physical element, of songs off the table.
And you've seen the numbers.
I mean, you know, the music industry is imploding in front of our very eyes, and Hollywood's worried as well.
They're facing a force that they haven't faced before.
And their response is draconian, and not necessarily the one that's going to get them out of this.
And finally, I'll give you one last example of free -- perhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics -- their abundance tends to make things free.
This is the price of a phone call to India per minute.
And what's interesting is that it was just 1990 when it was more than two dollars a minute.
India had, still has, a regulated phone system and so did we.
It was surprisingly non-innovative, moved very slowly, but then there was just so much fiber out there, you couldn't hold back, and look how quickly the price fell.
It's seven cents a minute, in many cases.
And the consequence of cheap phone calling, free phone calling, to India, is the pissed-off programmer, is the outsourcing.
It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization and one of the most powerful economic tools that we're seeing in our world today.
The force of India, and then China, and any other country that can contact our markets and will work with our companies -- because the communications are free -- is just beginning to be felt.
And I think that's probably one of the most important technology trends that we're looking at today.
Thank you.

<title>Chris Anderson : Technology's long tail</title>
<description>Chris Anderson, the editor of &lt;em&gt;WIRED&lt;/em&gt;, explores the four key stages of any viable technology: setting the right price, gaining market share, displacing an established technology and, finally, becoming ubiquitous.</description>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/jacqueline_novogratz_a_third_way_to_think_about_aid.html</url>
Clearly, we're living in a moment of crisis.
Arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us, and yet I stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive.
Because of some of technologies we've been talking about.
Because of the resources, the skills, and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world, with the mindset to create change.
And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen, who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower, but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.
And by definition, every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul, a global citizen.
You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another.
And no matter what country you live or work in, you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of, even in their most ordinariness.
Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty, how best we release their energies.
On the one hand, we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.
And on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid.
And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.
We call it patient capital.
The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent in Africa since 1970 and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption?
They use Mobutu as metaphor.
And their policy prescription is to make government more accountable, focus on the capital markets, invest, don't give anything away.
On the other side, as I said, there are those who say the problem is that we need more money.
That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out and we'll hand a lot of aid, but when it comes to our poor brethren, we want little to do with it.
They point to the successes of aid: the eradication of smallpox, and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.
Both sides are right.
And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.
Even more problematic, they're not listening to poor people themselves.
After 25 years of working on issues of poverty and innovation, it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented individuals on the planet than low-income people.
They must navigate markets daily, making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens, to move their way through society, and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family, they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.
And so we need both the market and we need aid.
Patient capital works between, and tries to take the best of both.
It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy, thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity, but as individual customers, consumers, clients, people who want to make decisions in their own lives.
Patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk, a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment, to use the market as the best listening device that we have, and the expectation of below-market returns, but outsized social impact.
It recognizes that the market has its limitation, and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people.
Now, entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons.
First, they tend to work in markets where people make one, two, three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level.
Second, the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure -- no roads to speak of, sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption.
Third, they are often creating markets.
Even if you're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages, it is something new.
And so many low-income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time, takes a lot of patience.
It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.
Not only to build the systems, the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way, but to connect those business to other markets, to governments, to corporations -- real partnerships if we want to get to scale.
I want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation.
In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur named Amitabha Sadangi from India, who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.
And he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether, despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in India make under a dollar a day.
They were creating subsidies either for large farms, or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use, rather than that the farmers wanted to use.
At the same time Amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in Israel.
It was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant.
And it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers, because these systems were both too expensive, and they were constructed for fields that were too large.
The average small village farmer works on two acres or less.
And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves, because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have.
And he used three fundamental principles.
The first one was miniaturization.
The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre, even if he had two, because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.
Second, it had to be extremely affordable.
In other words, that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest, or else they wouldn't take the risk.
And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls infinitely expandable.
What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre, the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth.
As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization, has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average, but this didn't happen overnight.
In fact, when you go back to the beginning, there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day, that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.
And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants to research, to experiment, to fail, to innovate and try again.
And when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers, that's when patient capital could come in.
And we helped him build a company, for profit, that would build on IDE's knowledge, and start looking at sales and exports, and be able to tap into other kinds of capital.
Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.
And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.
And while, again, you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in India into Pakistan, just to get the permits, over time we were able to start a company with Dr. Sono, who runs a large community development organization in the Thar Desert, which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.
And though that company has just started, our assumption is that there too we'll see the impact on millions.
But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation.
We're starting to see these happening all around the world.
In Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing has worked in partnership with us, with UNICEF, with the Global Fund, to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women.
And they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets for Africans around the world.
Lifespring Hospital is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India to bring quality, affordable maternal health care to low-income women, and it's been so successful that it's currently building a new hospital every 35 days.
And 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to reinvent a completely broken industry, building an ambulance service in Bombay that would use the technology of Google Earth, a sliding scale pricing system so that all people could have access, and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form of corruption.
So that in the terrorist attacks of November they were the first responder, and are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.
They've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances, and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in India.
This idea of scale is critical.
Because we're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed have reached at least a quarter million people.
But that's obviously not enough.
And it's where the idea of partnership becomes so important.
Whether it's by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets, government itself, or partner with major corporations, there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.
President Obama understands that.
He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund to focus on what works in this country, and look at how we can scale it.
And I would submit that it's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations, not only for their country, but ones that we can use in the developed world as well.
Invest financial assistance, but also management assistance.
And then measure the returns, both from a financial perspective and from a social impact perspective.
When we think about new approaches to aid, it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan.
We've had a rocky relationship with that country and, in all fairness, the United States has not always been a very reliable partner.
But again I would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen.
And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund, we could use this time to invest not directly in government, though we would have government's blessing, nor in international experts, but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country.
People like Rashani Zafar, who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country, and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.
And Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way called incremental housing, where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers into safe, affordable community housing.
Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation that are building schools across the country.
It's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the Taliban.
I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now, and those of you who've also worked there can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population, and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.
President Kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.
I would say that the converse is true.
That these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day, provide real pathways to hope.
And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan, while we need to strengthen the judiciary, build greater stability, we also need to think about lifting those leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world.
On one of my last visits to Pakistan, I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.
And we left Karachi one morning before dawn.
It was about 115 degrees.
And we drove for eight hours along this moonscape-like landscape with very little color, lots of heat, very little discussion, because we were exhausted.
And finally, at the end of the journey, I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.
And as we got closer, its significance became apparent.
That there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall.
Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life.
His name was Raja, and he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father.
And he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he hadn't taken his 12 children and 50 grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about 50 cents a day.
Because he was building these crops.
And with the money he earned he could stay this year.
And for the first time ever in three generations, his children would go to school.
We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.
And he said, "Of course I will.
Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore."
When we think about solutions to poverty, we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity.
Because at the end of the day, dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.
And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity.
Because that is where dignity really starts.
Martin Luther King said that love without power is anemic and sentimental, and that power without love is reckless and abusive.
Our generation has seen both approaches tried, and often fail.
But I think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power.
For that is what we'll need, as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us, and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.
The time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.
I can only talk from my own experience, but in eight years of running Acumen fund, I've seen the power of patient capital.
Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking, but to truly build systems that have created more than 25,000 jobs and delivered tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on the planet.
I know it works.
But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.
And so I urge you, in whatever sector you work, in whatever job you do, to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start from the perspective of those we're trying to help.
Rather than what we think that they might need.
It will take embracing the world with both arms.
And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability, with a sense of integrity and perseverance.
And yet these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generations.
And there is so much good that we can do.
Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert.
Thank you.

<title>Jacqueline Novogratz: A third way to think about aid</title>

Over the past couple of days as I've been preparing for my speech, I've become more and more nervous about what I'm going to say and about being on the same stage as all these fascinating people.
Being on the same stage as Al Gore, who was the first person I ever voted for.
And -- So I was getting pretty nervous and, you know, I didn't know that Chris sits on the stage, and that's more nerve wracking.
But then I started thinking about my family.
I started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great-grandfather, and I realized that I had all of these Teds going through my blood stream -- -- that I had to consider this "my element."
So, who am I?
Chris kind of mentioned I started a company with my husband.
We have about 125 people internationally.
If you looked in the book, you saw this, which I really was appalled by.
And because I wanted to impress you all with slides, since I saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs, I made a graph that moves, and I talk about the makeup of me.
So, besides this freakish thing, this is my science slide. This is math, and this is science; this is genetics.
This is my grandmother, and this is where I get this mouth.
I'm a blogger, which, probably to a lot of you, means different things.
You may have heard about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha, where a blogger talked about how you hack, or break into, a Kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen, and it spread all over. Kryptonite had to adjust the lock, and they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns.
You may have heard about Rathergate, which was basically the result of bloggers realizing that the "th" in 111 is not typesetted on an old typewriter; it's on Word.
Bloggers exposed this, or they worked hard to expose this.
You know, blogs are scary. This is what you see.
I see this, and I'm sure scared -- and I swear on stage -- shitless about blogs, because this is not something that's friendly.
But there are blogs that are changing the way we read news and consume media, and, you know, these are great examples. These people are reaching thousands, if not millions, of readers, and that's incredibly important.
During the hurricane, you had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog, updating it frequently. This was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools.
You have my friend, who has a blog on digital -- on PDRs, personal recorders.
He makes enough money, just by running ads, to support his family up in Oregon.
That's all he does now, and this is something that blogs have made possible.
And then you have something like this, which is Interplast.
It's a wonderful organization of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it.
Children with cleft palates will get it, and they document their story. This is wonderful.
I am not that caring.
I talk about myself. That's what I am. I'm a blogger.
I have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing, and I am an expert on this person, and so I write about it.
And -- the short story about my blog: it started in 2001. I was 23.
I wasn't happy with my job, because I was a designer, but I wasn't being really stimulated.
I was an English major in college. I didn't have any use for it, but I missed writing. So, I started to write a blog and I started to create things like these little stories.
This was an illustration about my camp experience when I was 11 years old, and how I went to a YMCA camp -- Christian camp -- and basically by the end, I had made my friends hate me so much that I hid in a bunk. They couldn't find me.
They sent a search party, and I overheard people saying they wish I had killed myself, jumped off Bible Peak.
You can laugh, this is OK.
This is me.
This is what happened to me.
And when I started my blog it was really this one goal -- I said, I am not going to be famous to the world, but I could be famous to people on the Internet.
And I set a goal. I said, "I'm going to win an award," because I had never won an award in my entire life.
And I said, "I'm going to win this award -- the South by Southwest Weblog award."
And I won it. I reached all of these people, and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life everyday.
And then I wrote a post about a banjo.
I wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo -- a $300 banjo, which is a lot of money, and I don't play instruments; I don't know anything about music.
I like music, and I like banjos, and I think I probably heard Steve Martin playing, and I said, "I could do that."
And I said to my husband, I said, "Ben, can I buy a banjo?" And he's like, "No."
And my husband -- this is my husband, who is very hot -- he won an award for being hot -- -- he told me, "You cannot buy a banjo.
You're just like your dad," who "collects" instruments.
And I wrote a post about how I was so mad at him; he was such a tyrant because he would not let me buy this banjo.
And those people who know me understood my joke.
This is Mena, this is how I make a joke at people.
Because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant: this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog.
And if he knew I was showing this right now -- I put this in today -- he would kill me.
But the thing was, I wrote this, and my friends read it, and they're like, "Oh, that Mena, she wrote a post about, you know, wanting a stupid thing and being stupid."
But I got emails from people that said, "Oh my God, your husband is such an asshole.
How much money does he spend on beer in a year?
You could take that money and buy your banjo.
Why don't you open a separate account?"
I've been with him since I was 17 years old. We've never had a separate bank account.
They said, "Separate your bank account -- spend your money; spend his money. That's it."
And then I got people saying, "Leave him."
And -- I was like, "OK, what, who are these people?
And why are they reading this?"
And I realized: I don't want to reach these people.
I don't want to write for this public audience.
And I started to kill my blog slowly.
I'm like, I don't want to write this anymore, and I slowly and slowly -- And I did tell personal stories from time to then.
I wrote this one, and I put this up because of Einstein today.
And I'm going to get choked up, because this is my first pet, and she passed away two years ago.
And I decided to break from, "I don't really write about my public life," because I wanted to give her a little memorial.
But anyways.
It's these sort of personal stories. You know, you read the blogs about politics, or about media, and gossip and all these things.
These are out there, but it's more of the personal that interests me, and this is -- this is who I am.
You see Norman Rockwell. And you have art critics say, "Norman Rockwell is not art.
Norman Rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms, and this is not something to be considered high art."
And I think this is one of the most important things to us as humans.
These things resonate with us, and, if you think about blogs, you think of high art blogs, the history paintings about, you know, all biblical stories, and then you have this.
These are the blogs that interest me: the people who just tell stories.
One story is about this baby, and his name is Odin.
His father was a blogger.
And he was writing his blog one day, and his wife gave birth to her baby at 25 weeks.
And he never expected this.
One day it was normal; the next day it was hell.
And this is a one-pound baby.
So Odin was documented every single day.
Pictures were taken every day: day one, day two ...
You have day nine -- they're talking about his apnea; day 39 -- he gets pneumonia.
His baby is so small, and I've never encountered such a just -- a disturbing image, but just -- just so heartfelt.
You're reading this as this happens, so on day 55, everybody reads that he's having failures: breathing failures and heart failures, and it's slowing down, and you don't know what to expect.
But then it gets better. Day 96 he goes home.
And you see this post.
That's not something that you're going to see in a paper or a magazine but this is something that this person feels, and people are excited about it.
Twenty-eight comments. That's not a huge amount of people reading, but 28 people matter.
And today he is a healthy baby, who, if you read his blog -- it's Snowdeal.org, his father's blog -- he is taking pictures of him still, because he is still his son and he is, I think, at his age level right now because he had received such great treatment from the hospital.
So, blogs.
So what? You've probably heard these things before.
We talked about the WELL, and we talked about all these sort of things throughout our online history.
But I think blogs are basically just an evolution, and that's where we are today.
It's this record of who you are, your persona.
You have your Google search where you say, "Hey, what is Mena Trott?"
And then you find these things and you're happy or unhappy.
But then you also find people's blogs, and those are the records of people who are writing daily -- not necessarily about the same topic, but things that interest them.
And we talk about the world flattens as being this panel, and I am very optimistic.
Whenever I think about blogs I'm like, "Oh, we've got to reach all these people."
Millions and hundreds of millions and billions of people.
You know, we're getting into China, we want to be there, but you know, there are so many people who won't have the access to write a blog.
But to see something like the $100 computer is amazing, because it's a -- blogging software is simple.
We have a successful company because of timing, and because of perseverance, but it's simple stuff -- it's not rocket science.
And so, that's an amazing thing to consider.
So, the life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important.
We started with a slide of my Teds, and I had to add this slide, because I knew that the minute I showed this, my mom -- my mom will see this deck somehow, because she does read my blog -- and she'll say, "Why wasn't there a picture of me?"
This is my mom. So, I have all of the people that I know of.
But this is basically the extent of the family that I know in terms of my direct line.
I showed a Norman Rockwell painting before, and this one I grew up with, looking at constantly.
I would spend hours looking at just the connections, saying, "Oh, the little kid up at the top has red hair; so does that first generation up there."
And just these little things.
This is not science, but this was enough for me to be really so interested in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line.
So, that has always influenced me.
I have this record, this 1910 census of another Grabowski -- that's my maiden name -- and there's a Theodore, because there's always a Theodore.
This is all I have. I have a couple of facts about somebody.
I have their date of birth, and their age, and what they did in their household, if they spoke English, and that's it. That's all I know of these people.
And it's pretty sad, because I only go back five generations, and then it's it. I don't even know what happens on my mom's side, because she's from Cuba and I don't have that many things.
And just doing this I spent time in the archives -- that's another thing why my husband's a saint -- I spent time in the Washington archives, just sitting there, looking for these things. Now it's online, but he sat through that.
And so you have this record and, you know, this is my great-great-grandmother.
This is the only picture I have. And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs; to think about the people who are on those $100 computers talking about who they are, sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing.
Another photo that has greatly influenced me, or a series of photos, is this project that's done by an Argentinean man and his wife.
And he's basically taking a picture of his family everyday for the past, what is '76 -- 20, oh my God, I'm '77 -- 29 years? Twenty-nine years.
There was a joke, originally, about my graph that I left out, which is: you see all this math? I'm just happy I was able to add it up to 100, because that's my skill set.
So you have these people aging, and now this is them today, or last year, and that's a powerful thing to have, to be able to track this.
I wish that I would have this of my family.
I know that one day my children will be wondering -- or my grandchildren, or my great-grandchildren, if I ever have children -- what I am going to -- who I was, so I do something that's very narcissistic: I am a blogger -- that is an amazing thing for me, because it captures a moment in time everyday.
I take a picture of myself -- I've been doing this since last year -- every single day.
And, you know, it's the same picture; it's basically the same person.
Only a couple of people read it. I don't write this for this audience; I'm showing it now, but I would go insane if this was really public.
About four people probably read it, and they tell me, you know, "You haven't updated" -- I'm probably going to get people telling me I haven't updated -- but this is something that's amazing, because I can go back to a day -- I can go back to April 2005, and say, what was I doing this day? I look at it, I know exactly.
It's this visual cue that is so important to what we do.
I put the bad pictures up too, because there are bad pictures.
And I remember instantly: I am in Germany in this -- I had to go for a one-day trip.
I was sick, and I was in a hotel room, and I wanted not to be there. And so you see these things.
It's not just always smiling. Now I've kind of evolved it, so I have this look.
If you look at my driver's license I have the same look, and it's -- it's -- a pretty disturbing thing but it's something that is really important.
And the last story I really want to tell is this story, because this is probably the one that means the most to me in all of what I'm doing.
And I'll probably get choked up, because I tend to when I talk about this.
So, this woman, her name was Emma, and she was a blogger on our service, TypePad. And she was a beta tester, so she was there right when we opened -- you know, there were 100 people -- and she wrote about her life dealing with cancer.
She was writing and writing and writing, and we all started reading it, because we had so few blogs on the service, we could keep track of everyone.
And she was writing one day, and, you know, then she disappeared for a little bit.
And her sister came on, and she said that Emma had passed away. And all of our support staff who had talked to her were really emotional, and it was a very hard day at the company.
And this was one of those instances where I realized how much blogging affects our relationship, and flattening this sort of world.
That this woman is in England, and she lives -- she lived a life where she was talking about what she was doing.
But the big thing that really influenced us was, her sister wrote to me, and she said, you know, and she wrote on this blog, that -- writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing that had happened to her, and being able to talk to people, being able to share what was going on, and being able to write and receive comments.
And that was amazing -- to be able to know that we had empowered that, and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing, and that the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary, that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs, that we can be people who are open, and wanting to help and talk to people.
That was an amazing thing.
And -- and so I printed out her -- or I sent a PDF of her blog to her family, and they passed it out at her memorial service, and even in her obituary, they mentioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life.
And that's a huge thing.
So, this is her legacy, and I think that my call to action to all of you is: you know, think about blogs, think about what they are, think about what you've thought of them, and then actually do it, because it's something that is really going to change our lives.
So, thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/barbara_block_tagging_tuna_in_the_deep_ocean.html</url>
I've been fascinated for a lifetime by the beauty, form and function of giant bluefin tuna.
Bluefin are warmblooded like us.
They're the largest of the tunas, the second-largest fish in the sea -- bony fish.
They actually are a fish that is endothermic -- powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal.
That's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
You can see in its shape and its streamlined design it's powered for ocean swimming.
It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins, gets lift, powers its movements with a lunate tail.
It's actually got a naked skin for most of its body, so it reduces friction with the water.
This is what one of nature's finest machines.
Now, bluefin were revered by Man for all of human history.
For 4,000 years, we fished sustainably for this animal, and it's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago.
Bluefin are in cave paintings in France.
They're on coins that date back 3,000 years.
This fish was revered by humankind.
It was fished sustainably till all of time, except for our generation.
Bluefin are pursued wherever they go -- there is a gold rush on Earth, and this is a gold rush for bluefin.
There are traps that fish sustainably up until recently.
And yet, the type of fishing going on today, with pens, with enormous stakes, is really wiping bluefin ecologically off the planet.
Now bluefin, in general, goes to one place: Japan.
Some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin.
They're delectable muscle, rich in fat -- absolutely taste delicious.
And that's their problem; we're eating them to death.
Now in the Atlantic, the story is pretty simple.
Bluefin have two populations: one large, one small.
The North American population is fished at about 2,000 ton.
The European population and North African -- the Eastern bluefin tuna -- is fished at tremendous levels: 50,000 tons over the last decade almost every year.
The result is whether you're looking at the West or the Eastern bluefin population, there's been tremendous decline on both sides, as much as 90 percent if you go back with your baseline to 1950.
For that, bluefin have been given a status equivalent to tigers, to lions, to certain African elephants and to pandas.
These fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months.
They were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago, despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of CITES I.
And if it's tunas you don't care about, perhaps you might be interested that international long lines and pursing chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks, sharks, marlin, albatross.
These animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries.
The challenge we face is that we know very little about tuna, and everyone in the room knows what it looks like when an African lion takes down its prey.
I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed.
This tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room.
It's the 21st century, but we really have only just begun to really study our oceans in a deep way.
Technology has come of age that's allowing us to see the Earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely.
And we've got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works.
Most of us from the ship -- even I -- look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea.
We don't know where the structure is.
We can't tell where are the watering holes like we can on an African plain.
We can't see the corridors, and we can't see what it is that brings together a tuna, a leatherback and an albatross.
We're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot.
The reasons these challenges are great is that technically it's difficult to go to sea.
It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf, the entire Pacific realm.
It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it.
And then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU, getting up close to a blue whale and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays, an engineering challenge we've yet to really overcome.
So the story of our team, a dedicated team, is fish and chips.
We basically are taking the same satellite phone parts, or the same parts that are in your computer, chips.
We're putting them together in unusual ways, and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before.
And for the first time, we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset.
Now, I've been working with tunas for over 15 years.
I have the privilege of being a partner with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
We've actually taken a sliver of the ocean, put it behind glass, and we together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display.
When the veil of bubbles lifts every morning, we can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean, one of the only places on Earth you can see giant bluefin swim by.
We can see in their beauty of form and function, their ceaseless activity.
They're flying through their space, ocean space.
And we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty.
Behind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
Here, for over 14 or 15 years, we've actually brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity.
We'd been studying these fish, but first we had to learn how to husbandry them.
What do they like to eat?
What is it that they're happy with?
We go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin -- it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful.
And then, better yet, we've got our own version of tuna whisperers, our own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton, who can take a big tuna and in one motion, put it into an envelope of water, so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea.
Jeff and Jason there, are scientists who are going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill, a flume.
And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan, but it's staying in place.
We're actually measuring its oxygen consumption, its energy consumption.
We're taking this data and building better models.
And when I see that tuna -- this is my favorite view -- I begin to wonder: how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did?
So take a look at that animal.
That's the closest you'll probably ever get.
Now, the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean.
So in a program called Tag-A-Giant we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada, from Corsica to Spain.
We've fished with many nations around the world in an effort to basically put electronic computers inside giant tunas.
We've actually tagged 1,100 tunas.
And I'm going to show you three clips, because I tagged 1,100 tunas.
It's a very hard process, but it's a ballet.
We bring the tuna out, we measure it.
A team of fishers, captains, scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes.
We put water over its gills, give it oxygen.
And then with a lot of effort, after tagging, putting in the computer, making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment, we send this fish back into the sea.
And when it goes, we're always happy.
We see a flick of the tail.
And from our data that gets collected, when that tag comes back, because a fisher returns it for a thousand-dollar reward, we can get tracks beneath the sea for up to five years now, on a backboned animal.
Now sometimes the tunas are really large, such as this fish off Nantucket.
But that's about half the size of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged.
It takes a human effort, a team effort, to bring the fish in.
In this case, what we're going to do is put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna.
This tag rides on the tuna, senses the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish, detach, float to the surface and send back to Earth-orbiting satellites position data estimated by math on the tag, pressure data and temperature data.
And so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag.
Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive.
These tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in North America.
They are some of our finest instruments, our new technology in the ocean today.
One community in general has given more to help us than any other community.
And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina.
There are two villages, Harris and Morehead City, every winter for over a decade, held a party called Tag-A-Giant, and together, fishers worked with us to tag 800 to 900 fish.
In this case, we're actually going to measure the fish.
We're going to do something that in recent years we've started: take a mucus sample.
Watch how shiny the skin is; you can see my reflection there.
And from that mucus, we can get gene profiles, we can get information on gender, checking the pop-up tag one more time, and then it's out in the ocean.
And this is my favorite.
With the help of my former postdoc, Gareth Lawson, this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna.
This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean.
The warm is the Gulf Stream, the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine.
That's where the tuna wants to go -- it wants to forage on schools of herring -- but it can't get there. It's too cold.
But then it warms up, and the tuna pops in, gets some fish, maybe comes back to home base, goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina and then on to the Bahamas.
And my favorite scene, three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico.
Three tunas tagged.
Astronomically, we're calculating positions.
They're coming together. That could be tuna sex -- and there it is.
That is where the tuna spawn.
So from data like this, we're able now to put the map up, and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging.
And now we're showing that tunas on the western side go to the eastern side.
So two populations of tunas -- that is, we have a Gulf population, one that we can tag -- they go to the Gulf of Mexico, I showed you that -- and a second population.
Living amongst our tunas -- our North American tunas -- are European tunas that go back to the Med.
On the hot spots -- the hope spots -- they're mixed populations.
And so what we've done with the science is we're showing the International Commission, building new models, showing them that a two-stock no-mixing model -- to this day, used to reject the CITES treaty -- that model isn't the right model.
This model, a model of overlap, is the way to move forward.
So we can then predict where management places should be.
Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean are places where the single species, the single population, can be captured.
These become forthright in places we need to protect.
The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is, I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish, because they manage their fisheries well, they're doing a good job.
But in the international realm, where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild, these are the places that we have to make hope spots in.
That's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna.
Now in a second project called Tagging of Pacific Pelagics, we took on the planet as a team, those of us in the Census of Marine Life.
And, funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others, we were able to actually go in, in our project -- we're one of 17 field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators, not just tunas.
So what we've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska, met salmon shark on their home territory, followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that, if we take a salmon and put it on a line, we can actually take up a salmon shark -- This is the cousin of the white shark -- and very carefully -- note, I say "very carefully," -- we can actually keep it calm, put a hose in its mouth, keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag.
That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message.
And that shark leaping there, if you look carefully, has an antenna.
It's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon, sending home its data.
Salmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag.
But there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution on an ocean of temperature -- warm colors are warmer.
Salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into Monterey.
Now right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones are a white shark team led by Scott Anderson -- there -- and Sal Jorgensen.
They can throw out a target -- it's a carpet shaped like a seal -- and in will come a white shark, a curious critter that will come right up to our 16-ft. boat.
It's a several thousand-pound animal.
And we'll wind in the target.
And we'll place an acoustic tag that says, "OMSHARK 10165," or something like that, acoustically with a ping.
And then we'll put on a satellite tag that will give us the long-distance journeys with the light-based geolocation algorithms solved on the computer that's on the fish.
So in this case, Sal's looking at two tags there, and there they are: the white sharks of California going off to the white shark cafe and coming back.
We also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues, blue sharks.
And now, together, what we can see on this ocean of color that's temperature, we can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks.
We have white sharks and blue sharks.
For the first time, an ecoscape as large as ocean-scale, showing where the sharks go.
The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable: three teams tagged 1,700 tunas, bluefin, yellowfin and albacore all at the same time -- carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out, pick up juvenile tunas, put in the tags that actually have the sensors, stick out the tuna and then let them go.
They get returned, and when they get returned, here on a NASA numerical ocean you can see bluefin in blue go across their corridor, returning to the Western Pacific.
Our team from UCSC has tagged elephant seals with tags that are glued on their heads, that come off when they slough.
These elephant seals cover half an ocean, take data down to 1,800 feet -- amazing data.
And then there's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters wearing tuna tags, light-based tags, that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back, journeys of 35,000 nautical miles we had never seen before.
But now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small, we can actually see these journeys.
Same thing with Laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes, up to the same zone the tunas use.
You can see why they might be caught.
Then there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande tagging leatherbacks that go right past where we are.
And Scott Benson's team that showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia all the way to Monterey.
So what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are.
We can actually see how they're using ecospaces as large as an ocean.
And from this information, we can begin to map the hope spots.
So this is just three years of data right here -- and there's a decade of this data.
We see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on.
So what we're able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots, 4,000 deployments, a huge herculean task, 2,000 tags in an area, shown here for the first time, off the California coast, that appears to be a gathering place.
And then for sort of an encore from these animals, they're helping us.
They're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters.
They're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles.
Those are seals from many countries being released who are sampling underneath the ice sheets and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality on both poles.
This data, when visualized, is captivating to watch.
We still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data.
And then, as these animals swim and give us the information that's important to climate issues, we also think it's critical to get this information to the public, to engage the public with this kind of data.
We did this with the Great Turtle Race -- tagged turtles, brought in four million hits.
And now with Google's Oceans, we can actually put a white shark in that ocean.
And when we do and it swims, we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from California to Hawaii.
But maybe Mission Blue can fill in that ocean that we can't see.
We've got the capacity, NASA has the ocean.
We just need to put it together.
So in conclusion, we know where Yellowstone is for North America; it's off our coast.
We have the technology that's shown us where it is.
What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue is increasing the biologging capacity.
How is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere?
And then finally -- to basically get the message home -- maybe use live links from animals such as blue whales and white sharks.
Make killer apps, if you will.
A lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge.
Let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone.
That way we do away with a few internet myths.
So we can save the bluefin tuna.
We can save the white shark.
We have the science and technology.
Hope is here. Yes we can.
We need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans.
Thank you.

Hi there. I'm Hasan. I'm an artist.
And usually when I tell people I'm an artist, they just look at me and say, "Do you paint?"
or "What kind of medium do you work in?"
Well most of my work that I work with is really a little bit about methodologies of working rather than actually a specific discipline or a specific technique.
So what I'm really interested in is creative problem solving.
And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago.
So let me show you a little of that.
So it started over here.
And this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002.
I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas.
And as I was coming back, well I was taken by the FBI, met by an FBI agent, and went into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions -- "Where were you? What were you doing? Who were you talking with?
Why were you there? Who pays for your trips?" -- all these little details.
And then literally just out of nowhere, the guy asks me, "Where were you September 12th?"
And when most of us get asked, "Where were you September 12th?"
or any date for that fact, it's like, "I don't exactly remember, but I can look it up for you."
So I pulled out my little PDA, and I said, "Okay, let's look up my appointments for September 12th."
I had September 12th -- from 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., I paid my storage bill.
From 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time.
From 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., I taught my intro class, 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., I taught my advanced class.
"Where were you the 11th?" "Where were you the 10th?"
"Where were you the 29th? the 30th?"
"Where were you October 5th?"
We read about six months of my calendar.
And I don't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records of what I did.
But good thing I did, because I don't look good in orange.
So he asked me -- "So this storage unit that you paid the rent on, what did you have in it?"
This was in Tampa, Florida, so I was like, "Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida.
Furniture that I can't fit in my ratty apartment.
Just assorted garage sale junk, because I'm a pack rat."
And he looks at me really confused and says, "No explosives?"
I was like, "No, no. I'm pretty certain there were no explosives.
And if there were, I would have remembered that one."
And he's still a little confused, but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes realizes I'm not exactly a terrorist threat.
And so we're sitting there, and eventually after about an hour, hour and a half of just going back and forth, he says, "Okay, I have enough information here.
I'm going to pass this onto the Tampa office. They're the ones who initiated this.
They'll follow up with you, and we'll take care of it."
I was like, "Great."
So I got home and the phone rings, and a man introduced himself.
Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa where I spent six months of my life -- back and forth, not six months continuously.
By the way, you folks know that in the United States, you can't take photographs of federal buildings, but Google can do it for you.
So to the folks from Google, thank you.
So I spent a lot of time in this building.
Questions like: "Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act that may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation?"
And you also have to consider the state of mind you're in when you're doing this.
You're basically face-to-face with someone that essentially decides life or death.
Or questions such as -- actually, during the polygraph, which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them -- one of the polygraph questions was ...
well the first one was, "Is your name Hasan?" "Yes."
"Are we in Florida?" "Yes." "Is today Tuesday?" "Yes."
Because you have to base it on a yes or no.
Then, of course, the next question is: "Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"
I work at a university.
So I was like, "Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly."
But they said, "Okay, aside from what we had discussed, do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"
So at the end of six months of this and nine consecutive polygraphs, they said, "Hey, everything's fine."
I was like, "I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys all along.
I know everything's fine."
So they're looking at me really odd.
And it's like, "Guys, I travel a lot."
This is with the FBI.
And I was like, "All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo, and here we go all over again."
And there was a sincere concern there.
And he was like, "You know, if you get into trouble, give us a call -- we'll take care of it."
So ever since then, before I would go anywhere, I would call the FBI.
I would tell them, "Hey guys, this is where I'm going. This is my flight.
Northwest flight seven coming into Seattle on March 12th" or whatever.
A couple weeks later, I'd call again, let them know.
It wasn't that I had to, but I chose to.
Just wanted to say, "Hey guys.
Don't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves."
"I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee.
Just letting you know. Heads up."
And so I just kept doing this over and over and over.
And then the phone calls turned into emails, and the emails got longer and longer and longer ...
with pictures, with travel tips.
Then I'd make websites.
And then I built this over here. Let me go back to it over here.
So I actually designed this back in 2003.
So this kind of tracks me at any given moment.
I wrote some code for my mobile phone.
Basically, what I decided is okay guys, you want to watch me, that's cool.
But I'll watch myself. It's okay.
You don't have to waste your energy or your resources.
And I'll help you out.
So in the process, I start thinking, well what else might they know about me?
Well they probably have all my flight records, so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online.
So you can see, Delta 1252 going from Kansas City to Atlanta.
And then you see, these are some of the meals that I've been fed on the planes.
This was on Delta 719 going from JFK to San Francisco.
See that? They won't let me on a plane with that, but they'll give it to me on the plane.
These are the airports that I hang out in, because I like airports.
That's Kennedy airport, May 19th, Tuesday.
This is in Warsaw.
Singapore. You can see, they're kind of empty.
These images are shot really anonymously to the point where it could be anyone.
But if you can cross-reference this with the other data, then you're basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent and putting it all together.
And when you're in a situation where you have to justify every moment of your existence, you're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner.
At the time that this was going on, the last thing on my mind was "art project."
I was certainly not thinking, hey, I got new work here.
But after going through this, after realizing, well what just happened?
And after piecing together this, this and this, this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this, and it actually became this project.
So these are the stores that I shop in -- some of them -- because they need to know.
This is me buying some duck flavored paste at the Ranch 99 in Daly City on Sunday, November 15th.
At Coreana Supermarket buying my kimchi because I like kimchi.
And I bought some crabs too right around there, and some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville.
And laundry too. Laundry detergent at West Oakland -- East Oakland, sorry.
And then my pickled jellyfish at the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route 18 in East Brunswick.
Now if you go to my bank records, it'll actually show something from there, so you know that, on May 9th, that I bought $14.79 in fuel from Safeway Vallejo.
So not only that I'm giving this information here and there, but now there's a third party, an independent third party, my bank, that's verifying that, yes indeed, I was there at this time.
So there's points, and these points are actually being cross-referenced.
And there's a verification taking place.
Sometimes they're really small purchases.
So 34 cents foreign transaction fee.
All of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts, and everything pops up right away.
Sometimes there's a lot of information.
This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was.
And then sometimes you get this.
Sometimes you just get this, just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City, January 22nd.
And I can tell you exactly who I was with, where I was, because this is what I had to do with the FBI.
I had to tell them every little detail of everything.
I spend a lot of time on the road.
This is a parking lot in Elko, Nevada off of Route 80 at 8:01 p.m. on August 19th.
I spend a lot of time in gas stations too -- empty train stations.
So there's multiple databases.
And there's thousands and thousands and thousands of images.
There's actually 46,000 images right now on my site, and the FBI has seen all of them -- at least I trust they've seen all of them.
And then sometimes you don't get much information at all, you just get this empty bed.
And sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information.
So you get something like this.
This, by the way, is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California -- Vietnamese sandwich.
So there's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations, empty gas stations.
These are some of the meals that I've been cooking at home.
So how do you know these are meals eaten at home?
Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times.
So again, you have to do some detective work here.
So sometimes the databases get so specific.
These are all tacos eaten in Mexico City near a train station on July fifth to July sixth.
At 11:39 a.m. was this one.
At 1:56 p.m. was this one. At 4:59 p.m. was this one.
So I time-stamp my life every few moments.
Every few moments I shoot the image.
Now it's all done on my iPhone, and it all goes straight up to my server, and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together.
They need to know where I'm doing my business, because they want to know about my business.
So on December 4th, I went here.
And on Sunday, June 14th at 2009 -- this was actually about two o'clock in the afternoon in Skowhegan, Maine -- this was my apartment there.
So what you're basically seeing here If you go to my site, there's tons of things.
And really, it's not the most user-friendly interface.
It's actually quite user-unfriendly.
And one of the reasons, also being part of the user-unfriendliness, is that everything is there, but you have to really work through it.
So by me putting all this information out there, what I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything.
But in this barrage of noise that I'm putting out, I actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life.
And you know very little about me actually.
And really so I've come to the conclusion that the way you protect your privacy, particularly in an era where everything is cataloged and everything is archived and everything is recorded, there's no need to delete information anymore.
So what do you do when everything is out there?
Well you have to take control over it.
And if I give you this information directly, it's a very different type of identity than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces.
The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies -- they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information, or restricted access to information.
And the reason their information has any value is, well, because no one else has access to it.
And by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you, the information that the FBI has has no value, so thus devaluing their currency.
And I understand that, on an individual level, it's purely symbolic.
But if 300 million people in the U.S.
started doing this, we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up.
Because it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything.
And we're getting to that.
When I first started this project, people were looking at me and saying, "Why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing, where you're at?
Why are you posting these photos?"
This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere and 750 million people were posting status messages or poking people.
So in a way, I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete.
I'm still doing this project, but it is obsolete, because you're all doing it.
This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis, whether we're aware of it or not.
So we're creating our own archives and so on.
And you know, some of my friends have always said, "Hey, you're just paranoid. Why are you doing this?
Because no one's really watching.
No one's really going to bother you."
So one of the things that I do is I actually look through my server logs very carefully.
Because it's about surveillance.
I'm watching who's watching me.
And I came up with these.
So these are some of my sample logs.
And just little bits and pieces, and you can see some of the things there.
And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see.
So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by -- Department of Homeland Security.
You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by.
I actually moved very close to them. I live right down the street from them now.
Central Intelligence Agency.
Executive Office of the President.
Not really sure why they show up, but they do.
I think they kind of like to look at art.
And I'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields.
Hasan, just curious.
You said, "Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone," but actually you do take the pictures and put on information.
So how many hours of the day does that take?
HE: Almost none.
It's no different than sending a text.
It's no different than checking an email.
It's one of those things, we got by just fine before we had to do any of those.
So it's just become another day.
I mean, when we update a status message, we don't really think about how long that's going to take.
So it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks, send, and then it's done.
And everything's automated at the other end.
On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage, the FBI gets crazy?
HE: Well it goes to the last point that I was at.
So it holds onto the very last point.
So if I'm on a 12-hour flight, you'll see the last airport that I departed from.
Hasan, thank you very much.

So if someone asked you for the three words that would sum up your reputation, what would you say?
How would people describe your judgment, your knowledge, your behaviors, in different situations?
Today I'd like to explore with you why the answer to this question will become profoundly important in an age where reputation will be your most valuable asset.
I'd like to start by introducing you to someone whose life has been changed by a marketplace fueled by reputation.
Sebastian Sandys has been a bed and breakfast host on Airbnb since 2008.
I caught up with him recently, where, over the course of several cups of tea, he told me how hosting guests from all over the world has enriched his life.
More than 50 people have come to stay in the 18th-century watchhouse he lives in with his cat, Squeak.
Now, I mention Squeak because Sebastian's first guest happened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen, and she promised that she would refrain from leaving a bad review on one condition: he got a cat.
And so Sebastian bought Squeak to protect his reputation.
Now, as many of you know, Airbnb is a peer-to-peer marketplace that matches people who have space to rent with people who are looking for a place to stay in over 192 countries.
The places being rented out are things that you might expect, like spare rooms and holiday homes, but part of the magic is the unique places that you can now access: treehouses, teepees, airplane hangars, igloos.
If you don't like the hotel, there's a castle down the road that you can rent for 5,000 dollars a night.
It's a fantastic example of how technology is creating a market for things that never had a marketplace before.
Now let me show you these heat maps of Paris to see how insanely fast it's growing.
This image here is from 2008.
The pink dots represent host properties.
Even four years ago, letting strangers stay in your home seemed like a crazy idea.
Now the same view in 2010.
And now, 2012.
There is an Airbnb host on almost every main street in Paris.
Now, what's happening here is people are realizing the power of technology to unlock the idling capacity and value of all kinds of assets, from skills to spaces to material possessions, in ways and on a scale never possible before.
It's an economy and culture called collaborative consumption, and, through it, people like Sebastian are becoming micro-entrepreneurs.
They're empowered to make money and save money from their existing assets.
But the real magic and the secret source behind collaborative consumption marketplaces like Airbnb isn't the inventory or the money.
It's using the power of technology to build trust between strangers.
This side of Airbnb really hit home to Sebastian last summer during the London riots.
He woke up around 9, and he checked his email and he saw a bunch of messages all asking him if he was okay.
Former guests from around the world had seen that the riots were happening just down the street, and wanted to check if he needed anything.
Sebastian actually said to me, he said, "Thirteen former guests contacted me before my own mother rang."
Now, this little anecdote gets to the heart of why I'm really passionate about collaborative consumption, and why, after I finished my book, I decided I'm going to try and spread this into a global movement.
Because at its core, it's about empowerment.
It's about empowering people to make meaningful connections, connections that are enabling us to rediscover a humanness that we've lost somewhere along the way, by engaging in marketplaces like Airbnb, like Kickstarter, like Etsy, that are built on personal relationships versus empty transactions.
Now the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us back to old market principles and collaborative behaviors that are hard-wired in all of us.
They're just being reinvented in ways that are relevant for the Facebook age.
We're literally beginning to realize that we have wired our world to share, swap, rent, barter or trade just about anything. We're sharing our cars on WhipCar, our bikes on Spinlister, our offices on Loosecubes, our gardens on Landshare. We're lending and borrowing money from strangers on Zopa and Lending Club.
We are trading lessons on everything from sushi-making to coding on Skillshare, and we're even sharing our pets on DogVacay.
Now welcome to the wonderful world of collaborative consumption that's enabling us to match wants with haves in more democratic ways.
Now, collaborative consumption is creating the start of a transformation in the way we think about supply and demand, but it's also a part of a massive value shift underway, where instead of consuming to keep up with the Joneses, people are consuming to get to know the Joneses.
But the key reason why it's taking off now so fast is because every new advancement of technology increases the efficiency and the social glue of trust to make sharing easier and easier.
Now, I've looked at thousands of these marketplaces, and trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients.
Let me give you an example.
Meet 46-year-old Chris Mok, who has, I bet, the best job title here of SuperRabbit.
Now, four years ago, Chris lost his job, unfortunately, as an art buyer at Macy's, and like so many people, he struggled to find a new one during the recession.
And then he happened to stumble across a post about TaskRabbit.
Now, the story behind TaskRabbit starts like so many great stories with a very cute dog by the name of Kobe.
Now what happened was, in February 2008, Leah and her husband were waiting for a cab to take them out for dinner, when Kobe came trotting up to them and he was salivating with saliva.
They realized they'd run out of dog food.
Kevin had to cancel the cab and trudge out in the snow.
Now, later that evening, the two self-confessed tech geeks starting talking about how cool it would be if some kind of eBay for errands existed.
Six months later, Leah quit her job, and TaskRabbit was born.
At the time, she didn't realize that she was actually hitting on a bigger idea she later called service networking.
It's essentially about how we use our online relationships to get things done in the real world.
Now the way TaskRabbit works is, people outsource the tasks that they want doing, name the price they're willing to pay, and then vetted Rabbits Yes, there's actually a four-stage, rigorous interview process that's designed to find the people that would make great personal assistants and weed out the dodgy Rabbits.
Now, there's over 4,000 Rabbits across the United States and 5,000 more on the waiting list.
Now the tasks being posted are things that you might expect, like help with household chores or doing some supermarket runs.
I actually learned the other day that 12 and a half thousand loads of laundry have been cleaned and folded through TaskRabbit.
But I love that the number one task posted, over a hundred times a day, is something that many of us have felt the pain of doing: yes, assembling Ikea furniture.
It's brilliant. Now, we may laugh, but Chris here is actually making up to 5,000 dollars a month running errands around his life.
And 70 percent of this new labor force were previously unemployed or underemployed.
I think TaskRabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption are like lemonade stands on steroids. They're just brilliant.
Now, when you think about it, it's amazing, right, that over the past 20 years, we've evolved from trusting people online to share information to trusting to handing over our credit card information, and now we're entering the third trust wave: connecting trustworthy strangers to create all kinds of people-powered marketplaces.
I actually came across this fascinating study by the Pew Center this week that revealed that an active Facebook user is three times as likely as a non-Internet user to believe that most people are trustworthy.
Virtual trust will transform the way we trust one another face to face.
Now, with all of my optimism, and I am an optimist, comes a healthy dose of caution, or rather, an urgent need to address some pressing, complex questions.
How to ensure our digital identities reflect our real world identities? Do we want them to be the same?
How do we mimic the way trust is built face-to-face online?
How do we stop people who've behaved badly in one community doing so under a different guise?
In a similar way that companies often use some kind of credit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan, or the rate of a mortgage, marketplaces that depend on transactions between relative strangers need some kind of device to let you know that Sebastian and Chris are good eggs, and that device is reputation.
Reputation is the measurement of how much a community trusts you.
Let's just take a look at Chris.
You can see that over 200 people have given him an average rating over 4.99 out of 5.
There are over 20 pages of reviews of his work describing him as super-friendly and fast, and he's reached level 25, the highest level, making him a SuperRabbit.
Now — -- I love that word, SuperRabbit.
And interestingly, what Chris has noted is that as his reputation has gone up, so has his chances of winning a bid and how much he can charge.
In other words, for SuperRabbits, reputation has a real world value.
Now, I know what you might be thinking.
Well, this isn't anything new. Just think of power sellers on eBay or star ratings on Amazon.
The difference today is that, with every trade we make, comment we leave, person we flag, badge we earn, we leave a reputation trail of how well we can and can't be trusted.
And it's not just the breadth but the volume of reputation data out there that is staggering.
Just consider this: Five million nights have been booked on Airbnb in the past six months alone.
30 million rides have been shared on Carpooling.com.
This year, two billion dollars worth of loans will go through peer-to-peer lending platforms.
This adds up to millions of pieces of reputation data on how well we behave or misbehave.
Now, capturing and correlating the trails of information that we leave in different places is a massive challenge, but one we're being asked to figure out.
What the likes of Sebastian are starting to rightfully ask is, shouldn't they own their reputation data?
Shouldn't the reputation that he's personally invested on building on Airbnb mean that it should travel with him from one community to another?
What I mean by this is, say he started selling second-hand books on Amazon. Why should he have to start from scratch?
It's a bit like when I moved from New York to Sydney.
It was ridiculous. I couldn't get a mobile phone plan because my credit history didn't travel with me.
I was essentially a ghost in the system.
Now I'm not suggesting that the next stage of the reputation economy is about adding up multiple ratings into some kind of empty score.
People's lives are too complex, and who wants to do that?
I also want to be clear that this isn't about adding up tweets and likes and friends in a clout-like fashion.
Those guys are measuring influence, not behaviors that indicate our trustworthiness.
But the most important thing that we have to keep in mind is that reputation is largely contextual.
Just because Sebastian is a wonderful host does not mean that he can assemble Ikea furniture.
The big challenge is figuring out what data makes sense to pull, because the future's going to be driven by a smart aggregation of reputation, not a single algorithm.
It's only a matter of time before we'll be able to perform a Facebook- or Google-like search and see a complete picture of someone's behaviors in different contexts over time.
I envision a realtime stream of who has trusted you, when, where and why, your reliability on TaskRabbit, your cleanliness as a guest on Airbnb, the knowledge that you display on Quora or [unclear], they'll all live together in one place, and this will live in some kind of reputation dashboard that will paint a picture of your reputation capital.
Now this is a concept that I'm currently researching and writing my next book on, and currently define as the worth of your reputation, your intentions, capabilities and values across communities and marketplaces.
This isn't some far-off frontier.
There are actually a wave of startups like Connect.Me and Legit and TrustCloud that are figuring out how you can aggregate, monitor and use your online reputation.
Now, I realize that this concept may sound a little Big Brother to some of you, and yes, there are some enormous transparency and privacy issues to solve, but ultimately, if we can collect our personal reputation, we can actually control it more, and extract the immense value that will flow from it.
Also, more so than our credit history, we can actually shape our reputation.
Just think of Sebastian and how he bought the cat to influence his.
Now privacy issues aside, the other really interesting issue I'm looking at is how do we empower digital ghosts, people [who] for whatever reason, are not active online, but are some of the most trustworthy people in the world?
How do we take their contributions to their jobs, their communities and their families, and convert that value into reputation capital?
Ultimately, when we get it right, reputation capital could create a massive positive disruption in who has power, trust and influence.
A three-digit score, your traditional credit history, that only 30 percent of us actually know what it is, will no longer be the determining factor in how much things cost, what we can access, and, in many instances, limit what we can do in the world.
Indeed, reputation is a currency that I believe will become more powerful than our credit history in the 21st century.
Reputation will be the currency that says that you can trust me.
Now the interesting thing is, reputation is the socioeconomic lubricant that makes collaborative consumption work and scale, but the sources it will be generated from, and its applications, are far bigger than this space alone.
Let me give you one example from the world of recruiting, where reputation data will make the résumé seem like an archaic relic of the past.
Four years ago, tech bloggers and entrepreneurs Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood, decided to start something called Stack Overflow.
Now, Stack Overflow is basically a platform where experienced programmers can ask other good programmers highly detailed technical questions on things like tiny pixels and chrome extensions.
This site receives five and a half thousand questions a day, and 80 percent of these receive accurate answers.
Now users earn reputation in a whole range of ways, but it's basically by convincing their peers they know what they're talking about.
Now a few months after this site launched, the founders heard about something interesting, and it actually didn't surprise them.
What they heard was that users were putting their reputation scores on the top of their résumés, and that recruiters were searching the platform to find people with unique talents.
Now thousands of programmers today are finding better jobs this way, because Stack Overflow and the reputation dashboards provide a priceless window into how someone really behaves, and what their peers think of them.
But the bigger principle of what's happening behind Stack Overflow, I think, is incredibly exciting.
People are starting to realize that the reputation they generate in one place has value beyond the environments from which it was built.
You know, it's very interesting.
When you talk to super-users, whether that's SuperRabbits or super-people on Stack Overflow, or Uberhosts, they all talk about how having a high reputation unlocks a sense of their own power.
On Stack Overflow, it creates a level playing field, enabling the people with the real talent to rise to the top.
On Airbnb, the people often become more important than the spaces. On TaskRabbit, it gives people control of their economic activity.
Now at the end of my tea with Sebastian, he told me how, on a bad, rainy day, when he hasn't had a customer in his bookstore, he thinks of all the people around the world who've said something wonderful about him, and what that says about him as a person.
He's turning 50 this year, and he's convinced that the rich tapestry of reputation he's built on Airbnb will lead him to doing something interesting with the rest of his life.
You know, there are only a few windows in history where the opportunity exists to reinvent part of how our socioeconomic system works.
We're living through one of those moments.
I believe that we are at the start of a collaborative revolution that will be as significant as the Industrial Revolution.
In the 20th century, the invention of traditional credit transformed our consumer system, and in many ways controlled who had access to what.
In the 21st century, new trust networks, and the reputation capital they generate, will reinvent the way we think about wealth, markets, power and personal identity, in ways we can't yet even imagine.
Thank you very much.

You all know the truth of what I'm going to say.
I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the French Revolution.
What's changed is we now can look at the evidence, we can compare societies, more and less equal societies, and see what inequality does.
I'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links I'm going to be showing you exist.
But first, see what a miserable lot we are.
I want to start though with a paradox.
This shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average.
And you see the countries on the right, like Norway and the USA, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.
There's no suggestion of a relationship there.
But if we look within our societies, there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society.
This, again, is life expectancy.
These are small areas of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top.
So income means something very important within our societies, and nothing between them.
The explanation of that paradox is that, within our societies, we're looking at relative income or social position, social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us.
And as soon as you've got that idea, you should immediately wonder: what happens if we widen the differences, or compress them, make the income differences bigger or smaller?
And that's what I'm going to show you.
I'm not using any hypothetical data.
I'm taking data from the U.N. -- it's the same as the World Bank has -- on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies.
The measure we've used, because it's easy to understand and you can download it, is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country.
And you see in the more equal countries on the left -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- the top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the more unequal end -- U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore -- the differences are twice as big.
On that measure, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.
Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.
We collected data on problems with social gradients, the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, on kids' maths and literacy scores, on infant mortality rates, homicide rates, proportion of the population in prison, teenage birthrates, levels of trust, obesity, mental illness -- which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction -- and social mobility.
We put them all in one index.
They're all weighted equally.
Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things.
And there, you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you, which I shall use over and over again in the data.
The more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems.
It's an extraordinarily close correlation.
But if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, gross national income, there's nothing there, no correlation anymore.
We were a little bit worried that people might think we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence, so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well-being.
It has 40 different components put together by other people.
It contains whether kids can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, what immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school.
Everything goes into it.
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies.
Highly significant relationship.
But once again, if you look at that measure of child well-being, in relation to national income per person, there's no relationship, no suggestion of a relationship.
What all the data I've shown you so far says is the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth.
That's very important in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much.
I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index.
Here, for instance, is trust.
It's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted.
It comes from the World Values Survey.
You see, at the more unequal end, it's about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others.
But in the more equal societies, it rises to 60 or 65 percent.
And if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital, very similar relationships closely related to inequality.
I may say, we did all this work twice.
We did it first on these rich, developed countries, and then as a separate test bed, we repeated it all on the 50 American states -- asking just the same question: do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures?
So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality.
Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust.
Same thing is going on.
Basically we found that almost anything that's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the 50 states in that separate test bed.
We're not just talking about a fluke.
This is mental illness.
WHO put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society.
This is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year.
And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that -- whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others.
And again, closely related to inequality.
This is violence.
These red dots are American states, and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
But look at the scale of the differences.
It goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150.
This is the proportion of the population in prison.
There's a about a tenfold difference there, log scale up the side.
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison.
That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime.
In some places, that's part of it.
But most of it is about more punitive sentencing, harsher sentencing.
And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty.
Here we have children dropping out of high school.
Again, quite big differences.
Extraordinarily damaging, if you're talking about using the talents of the population.
This is social mobility.
It's actually a measure of mobility based on income.
Basically, it's asking: do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no relationship between the two?
And at the more unequal end, fathers' income is much more important -- in the U.K., USA.
And in Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less important.
There's more social mobility.
And as we like to say -- and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here -- if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
I've shown you just a few things in italics here.
I could have shown a number of other problems.
They're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries -- not just a little bit worse, but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.
Think of the expense, the human cost of that.
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points.
One is that, in graph after graph, we find the countries that do worse, whatever the outcome, seem to be the more unequal ones, and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality.
It's not just one or two things that go wrong, it's most things.
The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that, if you look at the bottom, Sweden and Japan, they're very different countries in all sorts of ways.
The position of women, how closely they keep to the nuclear family, are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world.
But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality.
Sweden has huge differences in earnings, and it narrows the gap through taxation, general welfare state, generous benefits and so on.
Japan is rather different though.
It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax.
It has lower taxes.
It has a smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states, we find rather the same contrast.
There are some states that do well through redistribution, some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax.
So we conclude that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality, as long as you get there somehow.
I am not talking about perfect equality, I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies.
Another really surprising part of this picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality.
There seems to be some truth in John Donne's "No man is an island."
And in a number of studies, it's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.
And so it's anachronistically a classification by fathers' occupations, so single parents go on their own.
But then where it says "low social class," that's unskilled manual occupations.
It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle, then the junior non-manual, going up high to the professional occupations -- doctors, lawyers, directors of larger companies.
You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society.
We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally.
And that seems to be the general picture -- that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom, but has some benefits even at the top.
But I should say a few words about what's going on.
I think I'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality.
More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, of being valued and devalued, respected and disrespected.
And of course, those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status insecurity.
We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others, whether we're regarded as attractive, clever, all that kind of thing.
The social-evaluative judgments increase, the fear of those social-evaluative judgments.
Interestingly, some parallel work going on in social psychology: some people reviewed 208 different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones, their responses to doing stressful tasks, measured.
And in the review, what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol, the central stress hormone.
And the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat -- threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance.
Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress.
Now we have been criticized.
Of course, there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising.
I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data, we never pick and choose data.
We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at, it goes into the analysis.
Our data source decides whether it's reliable data, we don't.
Otherwise that would introduce bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals.
This isn't confined to these countries here, hiding a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same measure of inequality, one problem after another.
Why don't we control for other factors?
Well we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't make any difference.
And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on.
What about causality?
Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality.
We spend a good bit of time.
And indeed, people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes.
The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or for instance, the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on.
I should say that to deal with this, we've got to deal with the post-tax things and the pre-tax things.
We've got to constrain income, the bonus culture incomes at the top.
I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can.
I think the take-home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us.
Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies, and that's exciting.
Thank you.

Nine years ago, I worked for the U.S. government in Iraq, helping rebuild the electricity infrastructure.
And I was there, and I worked in that job because I believe that technology can improve people's lives.
One afternoon, I had tea with a storekeeper at the Al Rasheed Hotel in Baghdad, and he said to me, "You Americans, you can put a man on the moon, but when I get home tonight, I won't be able to turn on my lights."
At the time, the U.S. government had spent more than two billion dollars on electricity reconstruction.
How do you ensure technology reaches users?
How do you put it in their hands so that it is useful?
So those are the questions that my colleagues and I at D-Rev ask ourselves.
And D-Rev is short for Design Revolution.
And I took over the organization four years ago and really focused it on developing products that actually reach users, and not just any users, but customers who live on less than four dollars a day.
One of the key areas we've been working on recently is medical devices, and while it may not be obvious that medical devices have something in common with Iraq's electricity grid then, there are some commonalities.
Despite the advanced technology, it's not reaching the people who need it most.
So I'm going to tell you about one of the projects we've been working on, the ReMotion Knee, and it's a prosthetic knee for above-knee amputees.
And this project started when the Jaipur Foot Organization, the largest fitter of prosthetic limbs in the world, came to the Bay Area and they said, "We need a better knee."
Chances are, if you're living on less than four dollars a day, and you're an amputee, you've lost your limb in a vehicle accident.
Most people think it's land mines, but it's a vehicle accident.
You're walking by the side of the road and you're hit by a truck, or you're trying to to jump on a moving train, you're late for work, and your pant leg gets caught.
And the reality is that if you don't have much money, like this young named Kamal right here, the option you really have And how big a problem is this?
There's over three million amputees every year who need a new or replacement knee.
And what are their options?
This is a high-end. This is what we'd call a "smart knee."
It's got a microprocessor inside.
It can pretty much do anything, but it's 20,000 dollars, and to give you a sense of who wears this, veterans, American veterans coming back from Afghanistan or Iraq would be fit with something like this.
This is a low-end titanium knee.
It's a polycentric knee, and all that that means is the mechanism, is a four-bar mechanism, that mimics a natural human knee.
But at 1,400 dollars, it's still too expensive for people like Kamal.
And lastly, here you see a low-end knee.
This is a knee that's been designed specifically for poor people.
And while you have affordability, you've lost on functionality.
The mechanism here is a single axis, and a single axis is like a door hinge.
So you can think about how unstable that would be.
And this is the type of mechanism that the Jaipur Foot Organization was using when they were looking for a better knee, and I just wanted to give you a sense of what a leg system looks like, because I'm showing you all these knees and I imagine it's hard to think how it all fits together.
So at the top you have a socket, and this fits over someone's residual limb, and everyone's residual limb is a little bit different.
And then you have the knee, and here I've got a single axis on the knee so you can see how it rotates, and then a pylon, and then a foot.
And we've been able to develop a knee, a polycentric knee, so that type of knee that acts like a human knee, mimics human gait, for 80 dollars retail.
But the key is, you can have this great invention, you can have this great design, but how do you get it to the people who most need it?
How do you ensure it gets to them and it improves their lives?
So at D-Rev, we've done some other projects, and we looked at three things that we really believe gets technologies to customers, to users, to people who need it.
And the first thing is that the product needs to be world class.
It needs to perform on par or better than the best products on the market.
Regardless of your income level, you want the most beautiful, the best product that there is.
I'm going to show you a video now of a man named Ash. You can see him walking.
He's wearing the same knee system here with a single axis knee.
And he's doing a 10-meter walk test.
And you'll notice that he's struggling with stability as he's walking.
And something that's not obvious, that you can't see, is that it's psychologically draining to walk and to be preventing yourself from falling.
Now this is a video of Kamal.
You remember Kamal earlier, holding the bamboo staff.
He's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee, and he's doing that same 10-meter walk test.
And you can see his stability is much better.
So world class isn't just about technical performance.
It's also about human performance.
And most medical devices, we've learned, as we've dug in, are really designed for Westerners, for wealthier economies.
But the reality is our users, our customers, they do different things. They sit cross-legged more.
We see that they squat. They kneel in prayer.
And we designed our knee to have the greatest range of motion of almost any other knee on the market.
So the second thing we learned, and this leads into my second point, which is that we believe that products need to be designed to be user-centric.
And at D-Rev, we go one step further and we say you need to be user-obsessed.
So it's not just the end user that you're thinking about, but everyone who interacts with the product, so, for example, the prosthetist who fits the knee, but also the context in which the knee is being fit.
What is the local market like?
How do all these components get to the clinic?
Do they all get there on time? The supply chain.
Everything that goes into ensuring that this product gets to the end user, and it goes in as part of the system, and it's used.
So I wanted to show you some of the iterations we did between the first version, the Jaipur Knee, so this is it right here.
Notice anything about it?
It clicks.
We'd seen that users had actually modified it.
So do you see that black strip right there?
That's a homemade noise dampener.
We also saw that our users had modified it in other ways.
You can see there that that particular amputee, he had wrapped bandages around the knee.
He'd made a cosmesis.
And if you look at the knee, it's got those pointy edges, right?
So if you're wearing it under pants or a skirt or a sari, it's really obvious that you're wearing a prosthetic limb, and in societies where there's social stigma around being disabled, people are particularly acute about this.
So I'm going to show you some of the modifications we did.
We did a lot of iterations, not just around this, but some other things.
But here we have the version three, the ReMotion Knee, but if you look in here, you can see the noise dampener. It's quieter.
The other thing we did is that we smoothed the profile.
We made it thinner.
And something that's not obvious is that we designed it for mass production.
And this goes into my last point.
We really, truly believe that if a product is going to reach users at the scale that it's needed, it needs to be market-driven, and market-driven means that products are sold.
They're not donated. They're not heavily subsidized.
Our product needs to be designed to offer value to the end user.
It also has to be designed to be very affordable.
But a product that is valued by a customer is used by a customer, and use is what creates impact.
And we believe that as designers, it holds us accountable to our customers.
And with centralized manufacturing, you can control the quality control, and you can hit that $80 price point with profit margins built in.
And now, those profit margins are critical, because if you want to scale, if you want to reach all the people in the world who possibly need a knee, it needs to be economically sustainable.
So I want to give you a sense of where we are at.
We have fit over 5,000 amputees, and one of the big indicators we're looking at, of course, is, does it improve lives?
Well, the standard is, is someone still wearing their knee six months later?
The industry average is about 65 percent.
Ours is 79 percent, and we're hoping to get that higher.
Right now, our knees are worn in 12 countries.
This is where we want to get, though, in the next three years.
We'll double the impact in 2015, and we'll double it each of the following years after that.
But then we hit a new challenge, and that's the number of skilled prosthetists who are able to fit knees.
So I want to end with a story of Prinima.
Prinima was 18 years old when she was in a car accident where she lost her leg, and she traveled 12 hours by train to come to the clinic to be fit with a knee, and while all of the amputees who wear our knees affect us as the designers, she's particularly meaningful to me as an engineer and as a woman, because she was in school, she had just started school to study engineering.
And she said, "Well, now that I can walk again, I can go back and complete my studies."
And to me she represents the next generation of engineers solving problems and ensuring meaningful technologies reach their users.
So thank you.

<description>We've made incredible advances in technology in recent years, but too often it seems only certain fortunate people can benefit. Engineer Krista Donaldson introduces the ReMotion knee, a prosthetic device for above-knee amputees, many of whom earn less than $4 a day.

B.J. was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future.
He had a vision. When he got out, he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight, and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision.
He'd spent 10,000 dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars.
It was my first week in federal prison, and I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV.
In fact, it was teeming with smart, ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the CEOs who had wined and dined me six months earlier when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate.
Now, 95 percent of the guys that I was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside, but when they talked about what they did, they talked about it in a different jargon, but the business concepts that they talked about weren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton: promotional incentives, you never charge a first-time user, focus-grouping new product launches, territorial expansion.
But they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days.
For the most part, everyone was just trying to survive.
It's a lot harder than you might think.
Contrary to what most people think, people don't pay, taxpayers don't pay, for your life when you're in prison. You've got to pay for your own life.
You've got to pay for your soap, your deodorant, toothbrush, toothpaste, all of it.
And it's hard for a couple of reasons.
First, everything's marked up 30 to 50 percent from what you'd pay on the street, and second, you don't make a lot of money.
I unloaded trucks. That was my full-time job, unloading trucks at a food warehouse, for $5.25, not an hour, but per month.
So how do you survive?
Well, you learn to hustle, all kinds of hustles.
There's legal hustles.
You pay everything in stamps. Those are the currency.
You charge another inmate to clean his cell.
There's sort of illegal hustles, like you run a barbershop out of your cell.
There's pretty illegal hustles: You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell.
And there's very illegal hustles, which you smuggle in, you get smuggled in, drugs, pornography, cell phones, and just as in the outer world, there's a risk-reward tradeoff, so the riskier the enterprise, the more profitable it can potentially be.
You want a cigarette in prison? Three to five dollars.
You want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head? Three hundred bucks.
You want a dirty magazine?
Well, it can be as much as 1,000 dollars.
So as you can probably tell, one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity.
Whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse, sculpting people's hair with toenail clippers, or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs, prisoners learn how to make do with less, and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they've learned to the outside and start restaurants, barber shops, personal training businesses.
But there's no training, nothing to prepare them for that, no rehabilitation at all in prison, no one to help them write a business plan, figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises, no access to the Internet, even.
And then, when they come out, most states don't even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background.
So none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex-offenders re-offend within five years.
Look, I lied to the Feds. I lost a year of my life from it.
But when I came out, I vowed that I was going to do whatever I could to make sure that guys like the ones I was locked up with didn't have to waste any more of their life than they already had.
So I hope that you'll think about helping in some way.
The best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons, because if we don't, they're not going to learn any new skills that's going to help them, and they'll be right back.
All they'll learn on the inside is new hustles.
Thank you.

<description>Jeff Smith spent a year in prison. But what he discovered inside wasn't what he expected -- he saw in his fellow inmates boundless ingenuity and business savvy.

The new me is beauty.
Yeah, people used to say, "Norman's OK, but if you followed what he said, everything would be usable but it would be ugly."
Well, I didn't have that in mind, so ...
This is neat.
Thank you for setting up my display.
I mean, it's just wonderful.
And I haven't the slightest idea of what it does or what it's good for, but I want it.
And that's my new life.
My new life is trying to understand what beauty is about, and "pretty," and "emotions."
The new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun.
And so this is a Philippe Starck juicer, produced by Alessi.
It's just neat; it's fun. It's so much fun I have it in my house -- but I have it in the entryway, I don't use it to make juice.
In fact, I bought the gold-plated special edition and it comes with a little slip of paper that says, "Don't use this juicer to make juice."
The acid will ruin the gold plating.
So actually, I took a carton of orange juice and I poured it in the glass to take this picture.
Beneath it is a wonderful knife.
It's a Global cutting knife made in Japan.
First of all, look at the shape -- it's just wonderful to look at.
Second of all, it's really beautifully balanced: it holds well, it feels well.
And third of all, it's so sharp, it just cuts.
It's a delight to use.
And so it's got everything, right?
It's beautiful and it's functional.
And I can tell you stories about it, which makes it reflective, and so you'll see I have a theory of emotion.
And those are the three components.
Hiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab took a ping-pong table and placed a projector above it, and on the ping-pong table they projected an image of water with fish swimming in it.
And as you play ping-pong, whenever the ball hits part of the table, the ripples spread out and the fish run away.
But of course, then the ball hits the other side, the ripples hit the -- poor fish, they can't find any peace and quiet.
Is that a good way to play ping-pong?
No. But is it fun?
Yeah! Yeah.
Or look at Google.
If you type in, oh say, "emotion and design," you get 10 pages of results.
So Google just took their logo and they spread it out.
Instead of saying, "You got 73,000 results.
This is one through 20. Next," they just give you as many o's as there are pages.
It's really simple and subtle.
I bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it.
That's the subconscious mind that sort of notices it -- it probably is kind of pleasant and you didn't know why.
And it's just clever.
And of course, what's especially good is, if you type "design and emotion," the first response out of those 10 pages is my website.
Now, the weird thing is Google lies, because if I type "design and emotion," it says, "You don't need the 'and.' We do it anyway."
So, OK.
So I type "design emotion" and my website wasn't first again.
It was third.
Oh well, different story.
There was this wonderful review in The New York Times about the MINI Cooper automobile.
It said, "You know, this is a car that has lots of faults.
Buy it anyway.
It's so much fun to drive."
And if you look at the inside of the car -- I mean, I loved it, I wanted to see it, I rented it, this is me taking a picture while my son is driving -- and the inside of the car, the whole design is fun.
It's round, it's neat.
The controls work wonderfully.
So that's my new life; it's all about fun.
I really have the feeling that pleasant things work better, and that never made any sense to me until I finally figured out -- look ...
I'm going to put a plank on the ground.
So, imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and 30 feet long and I'm going to walk on it, and you see I can walk on it without looking, I can go back and forth and I can jump up and down.
No problem.
Now I'm going to put the plank 300 feet in the air -- and I'm not going to go near it, thank you.
Intense fear paralyzes you.
It actually affects the way the brain works.
So, Paul Saffo, before his talk said that he didn't really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk, and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus.
That's what fear and anxiety does; it causes you to be -- what's called depth-first processing -- to focus, not be distracted.
And I couldn't force myself across that.
Now some people can -- circus workers, steel workers.
But it really changes the way you think.
And then, a psychologist, Alice Isen, did this wonderful experiment.
She brought students in to solve problems.
So, she'd bring people into the room, and there'd be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here.
It was an empty room, except for a table with a bunch of crap on it -- some papers and scissors and stuff.
And she'd bring them in, and she'd say, "This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life.
Would you tie those two strings together?"
So they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here and they couldn't reach the other string.
Still can't reach it.
And, basically, none of them could solve it.
You bring in a second group of people, and you say, "Oh, before we start, I got this box of candy, and I don't eat candy.
Would you like the box of candy?"
And turns out they liked it, and it made them happy -- not very happy, but a little bit of happy.
And guess what -- they solved the problem.
And it turns out that when you're anxious you squirt neural transmitters in the brain, which focuses you makes you depth-first.
And when you're happy -- what we call positive valence -- you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes, which makes you a breadth-first problem solver: you're more susceptible to interruption; you do out-of-the-box thinking.
That's what brainstorming is about, right?
With brainstorming we make you happy, we play games, and we say, "No criticism," and you get all these weird, neat ideas.
But in fact, if that's how you always were you'd never get any work done because you'd be working along and say, "Oh, I got a new way of doing it."
So to get work done, you've got to set a deadline, right?
You've got be anxious.
The brain works differently if you're happy. Things work better because you're more creative.
You get a little problem, you say, "Ah, I'll figure it out."
No big deal.
There's something I call the visceral level of processing, and there will be visceral-level design.
Biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors.
That's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits and bright plants, because you eat the fruit and you thereby spread the seed.
There's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain.
We dislike bitter tastes, we dislike loud sounds, we dislike hot temperatures, cold temperatures.
We dislike scolding voices. We dislike frowning faces; we like symmetrical faces, etc., etc.
So that's the visceral level.
In design, you can express visceral in lots of ways, like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot, exciting.
Or the 1963 Jaguar: It's actually a crummy car, falls apart all the time, but the owners love it.
And it's beautiful -- it's in the Museum of Modern Art.
A water bottle: You buy it because of the bottle, not because of the water.
And when people are finished, they don't throw it away.
They keep it for -- you know, it's like the old wine bottles, you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again, which proves it's not the water.
It's all about the visceral experience.
The middle level of processing is the behavioral level and that's actually where most of our stuff gets done.
Visceral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.
Behavioral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.
Almost everything we do is subconscious.
I'm walking around the stage -- I'm not attending to the control of my legs.
I'm doing a lot; most of my talk is subconscious; it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot.
Most of what we do is subconscious.
Automatic behavior -- skilled behavior -- is subconscious, controlled by the behavioral side.
And behavioral design is all about feeling in control, which includes usability, understanding -- but also the feel and heft.
That's why the Global knives are so neat.
They're so nicely balanced, so sharp, that you really feel you're in control of the cutting.
Or, just driving a high-performance sports car over a demanding curb -- again, feeling that you are in complete control of the environment.
Or the sensual feeling.
This is a Kohler shower, a waterfall shower, and actually, all those knobs beneath are also showerheads.
It will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hours -- and not waste water, by the way, because it recirculates the same dirty water.
Or this -- this is a really neat teapot I found at high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago.
It's a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot.
That's kind of what the teapot looks like but the way you use it is you lay it on its back, and you put tea in, and then you fill it with water.
The water then seeps over the tea.
And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right -- the tea is to the right of this line.
There's a little ledge inside, so the tea is sitting there and the water is filling it up like that.
And when the tea is ready, or almost ready, you tilt it.
And that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing.
And when it's finished, you put it vertically, and now the tea is -- you remember -- above this line and the water only comes to here -- and so it keeps the tea out.
On top of that, it communicates, which is what emotion does.
Emotion is all about acting; emotion is really about acting.
It's being safe in the world.
Cognition is about understanding the world, emotion is about interpreting it -- saying good, bad, safe, dangerous, and getting us ready to act, which is why the muscles tense or relax.
And that's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else -- because their muscles are acting, subconsciously, except that we've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion.
Well, this has emotions if you like, because it signals the waiter that, "Hey, I'm finished. See -- upright."
And the waiter can come by and say, "Would you like more water?"
It's kind of neat. What a wonderful design.
And the third level is reflective, which is, if you like the superego, it's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do, no control over the -- doesn't see the senses, doesn't control the muscles.
It looks over what's going on.
It's that little voice in your head that's watching and saying, "That's good. That's bad."
Or, "Why are you doing that? I don't understand."
It's that little voice in your head that's the seat of consciousness.
Here's a great reflective product.
Owners of the Hummer have said, "You know I've owned many cars in my life -- all sorts of exotic cars, but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention."
It's about attention. It's about their image, not about the car.
If you want a more positive model -- this is the GM car.
And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment.
And you'll buy it to protect the environment, even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive and not perfected.
But that's reflective design as well.
Or an expensive watch, so you can impress people -- "Oh gee, I didn't know you had that watch."
As opposed to this one, which is a pure behavioral watch, which probably keeps better time than the $13,000 watch I just showed you.
But it's ugly.
This is a clear Don Norman watch.
And what's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other, the visceral fear of falling against the reflective state saying, "It's OK. It's OK. It's safe. It's safe."
If that amusement park were rusty and falling apart, you'd never go on the ride.
So, it's pitting one against the other.
The other neat thing ...
So Jake Cress is this furniture maker, and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture.
And this is his chair with claw, and the poor little chair has lost its ball and it's trying to get it back before anybody notices.
And what's so neat about it is how you accept that story.
And that's what's nice about emotion.
So that's the new me.
I'm only saying positive things from now on.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_shows_how_kids_teach_themselves.html</url>
I have a tough job to do.
You know, when I looked at the profile of the audience here, with their connotations and design, in all its forms, and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks, and so on, that I wanted to tell you, I wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context.
In order to do that in 20 minutes, I have to bring out four ideas -- it's like four pieces of a puzzle.
And if I succeed in doing that, maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on, and perhaps help me do my work.
The first piece of the puzzle is remoteness and the quality of education.
Now, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things.
Of course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center, you get to remoter areas.
What happens to education?
The second, or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world, you have pockets, like slums, or shantytowns, or poorer areas, which are socially and economically remote from the rest of the city, so it's us and them.
What happens to education in that context?
So keep both of those ideas of remoteness.
We made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers.
If they do have, they cannot retain those teachers.
They do not have good enough infrastructure.
And if they had some infrastructure, they have difficulty maintaining it.
But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was we hired a car, looked up on Google, found a route into northern India from New Delhi which, you know, which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers, and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests, and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.
The graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully.
I mean, this is a very small sample; you should not generalize from it.
But it was quite obvious, quite clear, that for this particular route that I had taken, the remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be.
That seemed a little damning, and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure, or with the availability of electricity, and things like that.
To my surprise, it did not correlate.
It did not correlate with the size of classrooms.
It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure.
It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate.
But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire to each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers -- which was, "Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?" -- 69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that, they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi, and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi -- because, you know, those are relatively better off areas -- and then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes.
I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school, probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results.
So it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools, as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat, and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing. It appears that way.
When you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that, you know, things like websites, collaborative environments -- you've been listening to all that in the morning -- it's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools, and, according to me, biases the result.
The literature -- one part of it, the scientific literature -- consistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing.
The teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does.
Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting, let's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do.
You put in this new super-duper technology, and now they get 83 percent.
So the principal looks at it and says, 3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it.
If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools, where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing.
So the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make, would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top, but we seem to be doing it the other way about.
So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach the underprivileged first, not the other way about.
And finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception?
Whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology, the teacher's first reaction is, you cannot replace a teacher with a machine -- it's impossible.
I don't know why it's impossible, but, even for a moment, if you did assume that it's impossible -- I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke, the science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo, and he said something which completely solves this problem.
He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine, should be.
So, you know, it puts the teacher into a tough bind, you have to think.
Anyway, so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education, whatever alternative you want, is required where schools don't exist, where schools are not good enough, where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough, for whatever reason.
If you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies, then you don't need an alternative education.
So far I haven't come across such an area, except for one case. I won't name the area, but somewhere in the world people said, we don't have this problem, because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools.
There are such areas, but -- anyway, I'd never heard that anywhere else.
I'm going to talk about children and self-organization, and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like.
They're called the hole-in-the-wall experiments.
I'll have to really rush through this. They're a set of experiments.
The first one was done in New Delhi in 1999.
And what we did over there was pretty much simple.
I had an office in those days which bordered a slum, an urban slum, so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum.
They cut a hole inside that wall -- which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall -- and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end, a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall, put it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there, put it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there.
And this is what we saw.
So that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole-in-the-wall.
About eight hours later, we found this kid.
To the right is this eight-year-old child who -- and to his left is a six-year-old girl, who is not very tall.
And what he was doing was, he was teaching her to browse.
So it sort of raised more questions than it answered.
Is this real? Does the language matter, because he's not supposed to know English?
Will the computer last, or will they break it and steal it -- and did anyone teach them?
The last question is what everybody said, but you know, I mean, they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office, can you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him.
So I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it, this time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India, where I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything.
So it was a warm day, and the hole in the wall was on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there; he later on turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout.
He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad.
Very quickly, he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen -- and later on he told me, "I have never seen a television where you can do something."
So he figured that out. It took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television.
And then, as he was doing that, he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad -- you'll see him do that.
He did that, and the Internet Explorer changed page.
Eight minutes later, he looked from his hand to the screen, and he was browsing: he was going back and forth.
When that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children, like, children would come and see what's happening over here.
And by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing.
So eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there.
So we thought that this is what was happening: that children in groups can self-instruct themselves to use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances?
At this time there was a -- the main question was about English.
People said, you know, you really ought to have this in Indian languages.
So I said, have what, shall I translate the Internet into some Indian language? That's not possible.
So, it has to be the other way about.
But let's see, how do the children tackle the English language?
I took the experiment out to northeastern India, to a village called Madantusi, where, for some reason, there was no English teacher, so the children had not learned English at all.
And I built a similar hole-in-the-wall.
One big difference in the villages, as opposed to the urban slums: there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk.
In the urban slums, the girls tend to stay away.
I left the computer there with lots of CDs -- I didn't have any Internet -- and came back three months later.
So when I came back there, I found these two kids, eight- and 12-year-olds, who were playing a game on the computer.
And as soon as they saw me they said, "We need a faster processor and a better mouse."
I was real surprised.
You know, how on earth did they know all this?
And they said, "Well, we've picked it up from the CDs."
So I said, "But how did you understand what's going on over there?"
So they said, "Well, you've left this machine which talks only in English, so we had to learn English."
So then I measured, and they were using 200 English words with each other -- mispronounced, but correct usage -- words like exit, stop, find, save, that kind of thing, not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations.
So, Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier; in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to.
Finally, I got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else.
India is a good place to do such an experiment in, because we have all the ethnic diversities, all the -- you know, the genetic diversity, all the racial diversities, and also all the socio-economic diversities.
So, I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world.
So I did this for almost five years, and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of India.
This is the Himalayas. Up in the north, very cold.
I also had to check or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors, and I was using regular, normal PCs, so I needed different climates, for which India is also great, because we have very cold, very hot, and so on.
This is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border.
And you see here a little clip of -- one of these villages -- the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the English alphabet.
Then to central India -- very warm, moist, fishing villages, where humidity is a very big killer of electronics.
So we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power, so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running.
I want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again.
This sequence is also nice. This is a small child, a six-year-old, telling his eldest sister what to do.
And this happens very often with these computers, that the younger children are found teaching the older ones.
What did we find? We found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct in a connected environment, irrespective of anything that we could measure.
So if they have access to the computer, they will teach themselves, including intelligence.
I couldn't find a single correlation with anything, but it had to be in groups.
And that may be of great, you know, interest to this group, because all of you are talking about groups.
So here was the power of what a group of children can do, if you lift the adult intervention.
Just a quick idea of the measurements.
We took standard statistical techniques, so I'm going to not talk about that.
But we got a clean learning curve, almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school.
I'll leave it at that, because, I mean, it sort of says it all, doesn't it?
What could they learn to do?
Basic Windows functions, browsing, painting, chatting and email, games and educational material, music downloads, playing video.
In short, what all of us do.
And over 300 children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer.
So, how do they do that?
If you calculated the actual time of access, it would work out to minutes per day, so that's not how it's happening.
What you have, actually, is there is one child operating the computer.
And surrounding him are usually three other children, who are advising him on what they should do.
If you test them, all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them.
Around these four are usually a group of about 16 children, who are also advising, usually wrongly, about everything that's going on on the computer.
And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject.
So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing.
It seems counter-intuitive to adult learning, but remember, eight-year-olds live in a society where most of the time they are told, don't do this, you know, don't touch the whiskey bottle.
So what does the eight-year-old do?
He observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched.
And if you tested him, he would answer every question correctly on that topic.
So, they seem to be able to acquire very quickly.
So what was the conclusion over the six years of work?
It was that primary education can happen on its own, or parts of it can happen on its own.
It does not have to be imposed from the top downwards.
It could perhaps be a self-organizing system, so that was the second bit that I wanted to tell you, that children can self-organize and attain an educational objective.
The third piece was on values, and again, to put it very briefly, I conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over India, and asked them -- I gave them about 68 different values-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions.
We got all sorts of opinions. Yes, no or I don't know.
I simply took those questions where I got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes -- so I was able to get a collection of 16 such statements.
These were areas where the children were clearly confused, because half said yes and half said no.
A typical example being, "Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies."
They don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question; perhaps none of us do.
So I leave you with this third question.
Can technology alter the acquisition of values?
Finally, self-organizing systems, about which, again, I won't say too much because you've been hearing all about it.
Natural systems are all self-organizing: galaxies, molecules, cells, organisms, societies -- except for the debate about an intelligent designer.
But at this point in time, as far as science goes, it's self-organization.
But other examples are traffic jams, stock market, society and disaster recovery, terrorism and insurgency.
And you know about the Internet-based self-organizing systems.
So here are my four sentences then.
Remoteness affects the quality of education.
Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first, and other areas later.
Values are acquired; doctrine and dogma are imposed -- the two opposing mechanisms.
And learning is most likely a self-organizing system.
If you put all the four together, then it gives -- according to me -- it gives us a goal, a vision, for educational technology.
An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital, automatic, fault-tolerant, minimally invasive, connected and self-organized.
As educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it.
PowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology, but it was not meant for education, it was meant for making boardroom presentations.
We borrowed it. Video conferencing. The personal computer itself.
I think it's time that the educationists made their own specs, and I have such a set of specs. This is a brief look at that.
And such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness, values and violence.
So I thought I'd give it a name -- why don't we call it "outdoctrination."
And could this be a goal for educational technology in the future?
So I want to leave that as a thought with you.
Thank you.

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/carne_ross_an_independent_diplomat.html</url>
My story is a little bit about war.
It's about disillusionment.
It's about death.
And it's about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage.
And perhaps also, there's a lesson about how to deal with our screwed-up, fragmenting and dangerous world of the 21st century.
I don't believe in straightforward narratives.
I don't believe in a life or history written as decision "A" led to consequence "B" led to consequence "C" -- these neat narratives that we're presented with, and that perhaps we encourage in each other.
I believe in randomness, and one of the reasons I believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random.
I'm colorblind.
I was born unable to see most colors.
This is why I wear gray and black most of the time, and I have to take my wife with me to chose clothes.
And I'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy.
I loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside.
And it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot.
And I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot, and sure enough, I failed.
I couldn't see all the blinking different lights, So I had to choose another career, and this was in fact relatively easy for me, because I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood, which was international relations.
As a child, I read the newspaper thoroughly.
I was fascinated by the Cold War, by the INF negotiations over intermediate-range nuclear missiles, the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S.
in Angola or Afghanistan.
These things really interested me.
And so I decided quite at an early age I wanted to be a diplomat.
And I, one day, I announced this to my parents -- and my father denies this story to this day -- I said, "Daddy, I want to be a diplomat."
And he turned to me, and he said, "Carne, you have to be very clever to be a diplomat."
And my ambition was sealed.
In 1989, I entered the British Foreign Service.
That year, 5,000 people applied to become a diplomat, and 20 of us succeeded.
And as those numbers suggest, I was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world.
Being a diplomat, then and now, is an incredible job, and I loved every minute of it -- I enjoyed the status of it.
I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes and reveled in this amazing access I had to world events.
I traveled to the Gaza Strip.
I headed the Middle East Peace Process section in the British Foreign Ministry.
I became a speechwriter for the British Foreign Secretary.
I met Yasser Arafat.
I negotiated with Saddam's diplomats at the U.N.
Later, I traveled to Kabul and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban.
And I would travel in a C-130 transport and go and visit warlords in mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan, surrounded by my Special Forces escort, who, themselves, had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines, because it was so dangerous.
And that was exciting -- that was fun.
It was really interesting.
And it's a great cadre of people, incredibly close-knit community of people.
And the pinnacle of my career, as it turned out, was when I was posted to New York.
I'd already served in Germany, Norway, various other places, but I was posted to New York to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation.
And my responsibility was the Middle East, which was my specialty.
And there, I dealt with things like the Middle East peace process, the Lockerbie issue -- we can talk about that later, if you wish -- but above all, my responsibility was Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on Iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons.
I was the chief British negotiator on the subject, and I was steeped in the issue.
And anyway, my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time.
I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy.
We went through several wars during my time in New York.
I negotiated for my country the resolution in the Security Council of the 12th of September 2001 condemning the attacks of the day before, which were, of course, deeply present to us actually living in New York at the time.
So it was kind of the best of time, worst of times kind of experience.
I lived the high-life.
Although I worked very long hours, I lived in a penthouse in Union Square.
I was a single British diplomat in New York City; you can imagine what that might have meant.
I had a good time.
