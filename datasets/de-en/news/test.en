With regard to this report, during my visits to the Eastern European countries - Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary - lots of pensioners came up to me and said: "Mr Fatuzzo, we are pleased that the European Union is doing its best to make it possible for us to move freely within the Union but, even today, we are always being asked to show our documents, we are subjected to checks every few minutes and we have to prepare a large number of documents in order to be able to move from one part of the Union to another.
Please bear in mind that we are waiting anxiously for the day when we will genuinely be able to move freely."
We voted against this report because this report does nothing other than apply the Schengen accords, something we do not wish to approve, either directly or indirectly.
Whilst claiming to facilitate the freedom of movement of individuals within the European Union, the Schengen accords actually put up barriers along the path to achieving this freedom of movement, at least for those who are from countries outside the European Union.
We are in favour of total freedom of movement of individuals, whether or not they are from the European Union.
In fact, the European treaties guarantee the freedom of movement of capital, regardless of its origin, to the extent that they allow profits from arms trafficking, drug trafficking, even terrorism, to be laundered on European territory as long as the sacrosanct banking secrecy and business secrecy are protected.
Our vote expresses our opposition to a Europe built for capital, and not for individuals.
Report Goebbels (A5-0302/2001):
Mr Goebbels' report stresses the importance of the international monetary system for those who use money to attempt to boost their economy.
I voted for the report but I was unsure about one thing: I remembered that Neapolitan shoeshine, that penniless Neapolitan boy who, when he met a wealthy old industrialist in Ischia, was told: "When I was your age, I used to clean shoes instead of sitting here sunbathing.
Then I bought a taxi, then a public transport firm and then an airline, and then I became the owner of a satellite network."
"And what are you doing now?" asked the boy.
"Now I am sitting here, sunbathing in the sun of Italy and Ischia.
"And I," replied the boy, "what am I doing?!"
The Goebbels report on how to avoid international monetary crises is, on the whole, accurate, reliable and reasonable.
We are simply surprised that the report does not mention the euro once and that it does not reiterate the (very serious) argument that has been put forward before, whereby the euro, which is soon to become a major international currency, would control the dollar by forcing the US monetary authorities to abandon their policy of 'benign neglect' .
It is true that the dissident analysts believed, on the other hand, that a dollar/euro bipolar (or tripolar, if you count the yen) international monetary system risked being more unstable than the previous unipolar (or bipolar) system.
At any rate, this was an interesting debate, which should have fallen completely within the scope of the Goebbels report, having the added advantage of experience on its side, since the euro has been in circulation for almost three years, on the international currency markets at least.
Yet, the rapporteur carefully avoids this question.
Why is this so?
Simply because the theory of the euro having a stabilising effect, like that of the euro having a destabilising effect, was based on the same hypothesis, namely that the euro was to quickly become the second international currency, next to, if not equal to, the dollar.
This is far from being the case.
Not only is the euro not a major currency, but its value has depreciated, it is permanently on the verge of a crisis of confidence, and its international role is not progressing.
And, on top of that, we are heading towards unavoidable problems between the Member States!
If the European Union had not obeyed those with dogmatic views, if we had gradually developed the ECU whilst respecting the national currencies, the process would have been safer and more straightforward.
To sum up, the experience of the last three years confirms what we always believed: a wrong move in European monetary unification will actually make life much easier for the dollar.
In spite of the recent attacks, the good health of the latter also seems to be further evidence of this.
We understand why the rapporteur does not wish to dwell on the subject.
Following Mr Goebbels' excellent report, a motion has been tabled in the European Parliament that is too narrowly framed from the outset.
Moreover, the Commission' s representative expressed a position on its behalf, that is, firstly, false and, secondly, unacceptable, as it does not mention all the abuses now being committed other than terrorism, such as the international financing of the drugs trade and corruption.
Finally, a majority in Parliament, either inattentive or complacent, rejected many constructive amendments, including the creation of an Economic and Social Security Council, the need for better representation of all continents in global financial institutions, and the need to restrict financial transactions with Member States and off-shore centres which do not abide by even minimal international regulations.
Parliament has even refused to declare that 'financial speculation is one of the major causes of international financial instability' .
When democratic parliamentary institutions refuse to acknowledge the evidence, they cease to serve the common good.
The reason that I abstained was in order to highlight this, as I did not wish to counter the few positive effects that can still be found in the resolution after the report has foundered.
As the report points out, between 1975 and 2000, the world has gone through some 120 monetary crises, which the IMF defines as depreciation of a currency by more than 25% in the course of a year.
Regrettably, however, even in the knowledge that every such crisis involves enormous costs for the countries involved, as happened in the Asian crisis in the summer of 1998, the report offers no basic measures that could prevent the emergence of new crises with any degree of effectiveness.
Data from the Bank for International Settlements shows an enormous increase in international financial activity, which practically doubled in the 1990s, with trading on stock exchanges appearing increasingly disconnected from the real economy.
This, combined with an increase in the speed of circulation in the financial sphere has heightened instability, thereby helping to increase the gap between richer countries and developing countries.
Despite the report' s considerations and criticisms, specifically regarding the lack of democratic accountability of the IMF and its use by the USA and the G7, does not offer much by way of an alternative.
On the contrary, it suggests from the outset that it is unrealistic to expect the creation, in the foreseeable future, of a United Nations organisation that would exercise full universal powers of regulation and supervision, when this is precisely the path that should be promoted and pursued in order to achieve fair and democratic international relations that provide solidarity and are concerned about development and the fight against poverty.
Although it is to be welcomed that the rapporteur acknowledges that starting from scratch on growth and on combating poverty will require cancelling the debts of the poorest countries, it is disappointing that he does not put forward any other practical proposals, such as a Tobin-type tax or abolishing tax havens and that the majority in this House has rejected every move in that direction.
The Goebbels report sets itself the ambitious goal of how to make the international monetary system work better.
But for whose benefit?
We are entitled to ask this question, when the rapporteur believes that 'the IMF is the only institution concerned about the smooth operation of the world economy' .
The victims of its structural adjustment programmes will be delighted to hear this, and will not be particularly convinced by the request to the IMF to henceforth allow for 'social aspects' .
It is also significant that the report chooses to disregard any tax on speculative movements (Tobin style tax) and the need to abolish tax havens.
However, I did not vote against the report, in order to support two specific requests, which we see as fundamental.
We are in favour of eliminating third world debt and we therefore support cancelling the debt of the poorest countries and introducing a standstill procedure for the others.
In this spirit, this procedure should not produce a restructuring plan, but should enable us to cancel an illegitimate debt.
In spite of all these reservations, these proposals are heading in the right direction and I do not wish to stand in their way.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.12 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
2002 budget
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, guided by the 'guidelines for the 2002 budgetary process' , approved on 3 April, Parliament has attached particular importance to improving the efficiency of the European institutions, with particular emphasis, in this field, on the Commission reform that is currently underway and on the quality of the budget' s implementation.
In this context, we must once again state our continuing political support for the reform of the Commission and mechanisms are being put in place to effectively monitor it, in an attempt to avoid both the delays that we have seen and those concerning staff regulations, in which we want to see the position opportunely adopted in the European Parliament resolution respected. These are the mechanisms of the long-awaited reform, which must be implemented by all the European institutions: an increase in the size of the external delegations, and also better coordination between the legislative and budgetary procedures, amongst others.
These are well-known objectives and we shall continue to work to achieve them.
At the same time, and with a view to improving the monitoring of the budget' s implementation, we expect the Commission to produce a definition of clear objectives for implementation and a timetable for this, and we will see how the timetable is being respected in the course of the year by means of sources of information that are now being made available.
It is not possible to effectively assess the implementation of a budget if we do not have both clearly defined objectives and the means of finding out whether these objectives are being met.
It is also widely known that the European Parliament attaches clear priority to producing a more detailed study of the budget' s implementation.
We feel it is important to be able to forecast the budget for the following year.
Indeed, the budget is, by definition, a forecast.
Equally important, however, as establishing the forecast for the following year is being able to see how this forecast is being put into practice and, in cases where this is not being done, to know the reasons why.
This will also contribute to making good delays in payments that have already been identified and to being able to pay out new commitments more rapidly.
We want to eliminate outstanding payments as far as possible and also to ensure that new payments outstanding, or new RAL, to use the commonly accepted term in this field, do not occur.
Increased operational spending will also be promoted, with corresponding reductions in administrative spending.
This is also related, as you all know, to a set of horizontal amendments, in other words, amendments that cover the whole budget proposed by the Committee on Budgets, and which are designed to provide an real reduction in the RAL, greater speed in making payments and also increased operational spending rather than administrative spending.
Along the same lines, we state once again our intention to only decide on the basis of the most complete information and, consequently, we hope to have the following information supplied by the Commission soon: on the one hand, and most importantly, the study examining the impact of the various measures that have already been adopted in the field of agriculture under the reforms laid down in Agenda 2000, as well as their budgetary consequences and also those of the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises, in addition to the prospects for changes to the agricultural budget.
The European Parliament cannot be a budgetary authority in name only.
In order to reach a decision on a given budget line and, even more, on a given category of the budget, we need full and up-to-date information.
It is clear that, at the moment, with regard to the last reform of the common agricultural policy and the impact of the foot-and-mouth and BSE crises, we need more information.
This is why we have been asking for information since at least March of this year, so that we can make an informed decision, both on the 2002 budget and on the Letter of Amendment.
As important as our concern to have information, we hope that new measures will be identified, which will provide a response to the situation arising from the terrorist attacks of 11 September, specifically concerning Europol and Eurojust in the fields of justice and home affairs. We would also like to see measures in the field of external action, on increasing humanitarian aid and a diversification of development cooperation, without, of course, undermining previously given commitments.
I think that we all accept that the situation arising from 11 September has changed many aspects of world policy and therefore, since the budget acts as a mirror for this policy and reflects this policy, there are bound to be budgetary consequences for the new situation.
The consequences of this new situation are being felt in 2001 and will be in 2002 and in the future.
We see these consequences chiefly affecting refugees, and the tragic problem they create, but they also affect concerted action in terms of the European Union' s external policy.
We do not want to be systematically faced with faits accomplis.
We can now, therefore, certainly forecast changes in these situations and these new situations must be reflected in the budget.
The budget must accommodate them although they must not endanger other commitments already given by the European Union.
We have the greatest respect for the 1999 provisions on the financial perspective but we also have great respect for social and political dynamics and where political dynamics are concerned, we cannot fail to draw the necessary conclusions.
We have also stated on various occasions that we will not accept new needs and new challenges being met to the detriment of longer-standing needs which are still as topical as they ever were.
We also have great expectations of the report to be drafted by the Secretaries-General of the institutions on the multiannual study of administrative spending on preparations for enlargement.
We even feel that, as a natural consequence of this work at a technical level, it could then be followed up at political level, with cooperation between the two branches of the budgetary authority.
At this level, therefore, we will be able to draw political conclusions from information that we obtain technically, which is already being done.
Continuing with a different type of issue, but which is also pending, in the case of the Commission' s proposal, we are waiting for the drafting, in the very near future, of the proposal to mobilise the flexibility instrument that will ensure the means necessary for the conversion of the fishing fleets that were dependent on the old Fisheries Agreement with Morocco.
This flexibility instrument is a mechanism provided for in the Institutional Agreement. It has been used year after year and we are waiting to see the corresponding proposal for the year 2002.
In terms of sectoral objectives, I should like to highlight a few to which we attach particular importance, such as that of improving the European Union' s competitiveness, to which the priority of more and better employment has been linked.
It is not sufficient for declarations to be made at European Councils and summits. What we need is for these declarations then to be put into practice.
More and better employment also means more and better support, more and better support mechanisms for small and medium-sized businesses, progress on the e-learning initiative, which we would very much like to see have a corresponding legal basis and also the consolidation of common policies in the field of asylum and immigration.
It is also worth making special mention here of the intention to support the competitiveness of Member States' border regions in the context of the forthcoming enlargement, as well as extending the benefits of the Leader programme to cover the future Member States.
All of these aspects are considered, in our guidelines, in the proposals for amendments that we have tabled on the budgetary proposals, and in the comments that we have included on the budgetary proposals.
Of course, we shall also continue to fight to improve the level of payments.
I know that this is something that the Member States often attempt to avoid, but the fact is that, if we want to see more effective European institutions, if, furthermore, we want their actions to have greater credibility, and if we want to see their results being more successful, we must have the necessary means to make payments.
I would also remind you that under the terms of the Interinstitutional Agreement, in terms of the financial perspective, in 2002, the level of payments should stand at 1.08% of the gross domestic product of Member States and the Council' s proposals fall considerably short of this figure.
I shall conclude by expressing my complete willingness, in the period between this first reading of the budget for 2002 and the vote on it in December, to work together with the Council and the Commission in a systematic process to reach the most appropriate allocation of available resources and to find the appropriate responses to the challenges we are currently facing.
Hopefully, after the vote that will be held this coming Thursday, the European Parliament' s proposals will lie clearly on the table.
We would also like to see that our priorities are considered in all the discussions that take place between now and December and that they take account of what I have just said, which is that the position of the European Parliament and that of the Council must both be respected, so that, ultimately, it will be possible to use the best from each proposal.
What we cannot, of course, accept now is something that we have never accepted in the past: a dialogue of the deaf, in which some people state their wishes and other people accept what some people say they wanted.
In this specific case, and to ensure that real negotiation takes place, there must be respect for the positions of all parties involved, attention must be paid to everyone' s priorities and that a close look is really given to everyone' s priorities.
Only by adopting this approach will the discharge of the budgetary process be worthwhile.
Only through this approach will we ultimately have any guarantee of success and only in this way can we have any hope that the budget will receive a favourable vote in December and be approved.
We do have strongly-held positions but we are also willing to negotiate and what we want is an in-depth examination of the proposals of all sides so that the final outcome is a balanced one.
Thank you, Mr Costa Neves.
As Mr Costa Neves has finished his speech early, leaving us with a few seconds left over from the time he was allocated, I would like to take the opportunity to tell you something that will be of interest to you all: each second we spend debating here in Parliament costs us EUR 9.73.
I am telling you this so that you will understand that the reason I am so inflexible when it comes to the allocation of speaking time is this cost.
Mrs Buitenweg has the floor.

Mr President, you have once again pushed the boat out with this long conclusion, but perhaps I can once again try to finish my speech in less than ten minutes, and then the balance will be redressed after all.
This week, we are hoping to take a big step towards establishing the 2002 budget.
I, as rapporteur, have worked towards this for the past couple of months, and I have received a great deal of support from the MEPs of the other groups, Mrs Gill, Mr Ferber, Mr Virrankoski and the other MEPs, as well as from the rapporteur for the general budget, Mr Costa Neves. I expressly want to thank them all here for their pleasant and also very fruitful cooperation.
The trilogues involving the Council have also proved useful, and let me therefore count our blessings for once.
From this year onwards, the Council budget contains a special chapter dealing with the common foreign and security policy.
Since the Council now covers operational costs in its budget - which, unfortunately, do not fall within the remit of the Commission - such as for military planning capacity, it is necessary for democratic control to be possible.
It is also important to gain a clear insight into the administrative structures which are being set up, so as to avoid overlapping with Parliament offices.
That is not possible in a general Council budget if it is not clear how much is being spent on what and if Parliament does not give its opinion on those administrative expenses in general.
We are therefore pleased with a separate chapter since, in this way, Parliament can try to gain some control.
Now that we have chosen this path, I hope that the Council will approve a number of rational and very logical requests by this Parliament at second reading too.
For example, there is the issue of long and wild nights at the European Councils.
In the midst of all this wheeling and dealing, do Heads of Government still consider the financial implications?
I wonder about that.
During the meetings of the European Councils, the Dutch government is always equipped with a special calculator which closely monitors the implications for the Dutch contribution.
But who is accountable for the impact on the European budget?
A pertinent example of this is the Nice Summit.
In order to facilitate an agreement on vote weighting in the Council, compensating seats in the European Parliament were distributed lavishly.
Who will pay for this?
The Treaty of Amsterdam stipulated a maximum of 700 seats; we are now sentenced to 732 seats and the buildings are not designed to cope with this number.
In the short term, the number of MEPs could run well into the 800s, and I had better not hear a squeak from the Council when it is presented with the bill for this.
An example of a totally different nature is the Balkans.
Whilst, in front of running cameras, billions were given for reconstruction with one hand, the Council took away development aid with the other.
In order to avoid any repeats, it would be wise to add a financial picture to the political conclusions at important summits.
How much is it all going to cost us and does it involve new money?
It would be a sign of honesty if this were presented along with political conclusions.
For example, the situation in heading 5 has changed dramatically since the Berlin Agreement because, in those days, no consideration was given to, for example, developments in the second pillar, the common foreign and security policy, the third pillar, Eurojust, Europol, or expenses for the European data protection supervisor.
I welcome these developments, but I would equally welcome an explanation as to where the funding is coming from and at what expense that funding will be granted.
A second subject on which I should like to ask the Council to adopt a positive stance, quite apart from the annual budget discussion, is our request to consider how we want to give the taxpayer more value for money.
During that trilogue too, Parliament talked in that context about setting up a political working party, which will enable us jointly to examine how we can give more value for money for, each year, we discuss the nuts and bolts and minor changes to the budget, but the institutions, once they are up and running, are not subject to thorough reviews as far as their objectives and working methods are concerned.
Despite this, we should have the courage to move away from the way things have developed and question, once again, whether all the institutions, for example, all the agencies, should continue to exist in that way.
We are making a start this year at micro level by asking all the institutions to draw up a list of negative priorities.
After all, we should not only add items to the European budget, we should also learn to scrap some of them.
Interinstitutional cooperation is another area where huge savings could be made.
In this respect, I should like to make a concrete proposal.
Since the Treaty of Nice, it has been mooted that the Council would need a new meeting place for its half-yearly summits.
But the impact on the taxpayer and on the quality of life in the Leopold Quarter if yet another huge building were to be erected would be enormous.
Let us therefore examine together whether some of the Council meetings could take place here in the parliamentary House, in Brussels or in Strasbourg.
Look around you, as you already are doing. It is a beautiful building, and you will understand that we would not mind if cooperation were to develop in such a way that Parliament were to meet in Brussels only, and we would be delighted to make this environment available to you.
Until such time, and until the seat issue has been solved in another way, we really are stuck with two buildings that need to be altered to cope with a larger number of MEPs.
The Bureau has drawn up a three-year plan which serves as an indicative framework for expenses related to enlargement.
The other institutions, too, are working hard to ensure that the effects of enlargement are ironed out, and we cannot wait for these adjustments until 2004.
It is not an option for us to be in the middle of activities, still, when the first new Members join.
This means, therefore, that more funding is required prior to the accession of the candidate countries.
The Committee on Budgets has noted that, by means of rigid budget management, it is possible, in the coming year, to remain within the self-imposed maximum of 20% in the category of administrative expenditure, although we have always said that enlargement and buildings do not fall within this maximum.
As for the subsequent years, however, I am not convinced that this will work again.
Even if the other institutions implement their plans in preparation for enlargement, and even if Parliament faces higher costs because, by that stage, preparations will have got well and truly under way, in my opinion it will then be difficult to remain within the established ceiling.
Berlin in itself does not, therefore, merit unconditional praise.
However, the intention to enlarge by spending tax money in an efficient, effective and desirable manner does merit such praise. Let it therefore be the guiding principle in the budgetary procedures which follow.
You will have gathered by now that I am greatly irritated by the Council' s stance, and despite this, I shall try to mention a few other elements from my report.
I shall, first of all, focus on what it does not say.
The report does not contain any judgment by Parliament of the basis on which expenses must be paid as soon as a new statute for Members has been approved, and that is something which I very much regret.
Precisely because Parliament wishes to retain the power to decide on its own arrangements and does not therefore want expenses to form part of a package involving the Council, it is important for us to indicate at this stage what we want.
I should particularly like to ask the PSE and PPE-DE Groups to endorse the position which was initially included in my report, namely that, once the statute enters into force, only expenses actually incurred will be reimbursed.
I would like to mention something which is in the report.
I am delighted that the institutions reacted in a quietly positive manner to the request by the Committee on Budgets to take part in EMAS, the EU' s Eco-Management and Audit Scheme.
I should like to warmly congratulate the European Commission on the fact that it has already committed itself to this, and I hope that it will set an example for others, including the European Parliament itself.
There is still room for improvement on many levels, including in our House, for example with regard to differentiated waste processing and the use of environmentally-friendly materials, saving electricity and setting up a mobility plan for staff and Members alike.
Parliament has a model role to fulfil, and this also applies to realising sound environmental objectives. I would be grateful if we were to make a start on that next year.
Mr President, the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community was signed in 1952, and was to run for fifty years.
It comes to an end next summer and there is no intention to extend it.
We are therefore to debate the last ECSC budget, now, with expenditure to cover the period up until 23 July of next year.
Thereafter its assets, estimated to be worth EUR 1.1 billion, are to be transferred to the EU' s general budget, to be invested safely and profitably.
Earnings from the assets are to be used for funding research in the coal and steel industries.
It has been estimated that around EUR 45 million in earnings per annum will be available for these purposes.
The ECSC has not attracted payments for many years.
Its expenditure has mainly been financed out of a reserve intended for funding under the operating budget.
The largest item of expenditure in the last six months of the ECSC' s existence will, according to a proposal by the Commission, be in respect of social aid.
Of that, most is intended to be spent on special adjustment aid in countries where production in the coal and steel industries has been wound down.
In many countries the industry has social problems associated with it, and, consequently, the Committee on Budgets has decided to propose that EUR 16 million more than the Commission originally recommended should be paid in adjustment aid to Great Britain, Ireland and Belgium with regard to the special problems associated with their steel industries.
When the ECSC ceases to exist, social aid for employees in the coal and steel industries will end.
The Commission has not promised to distribute special aid out of the EU' s general budget for social purposes in these industries.
When the ECSC ceases to exist, the social dimension it represents will not continue in another form.
The ECSC' s resources have been used to finance important research.
Although earnings from the ECSC research fund will be channelled exclusively into research after it ceases to exist, there will be less money available than there is now.
For example, early next year EUR 72 million will still be channelled into research.
That is a considerable sum compared with the EUR 45 million that represents the earnings from the ECSC' s net assets that will be used for research.
Consequently, we could say that the fact that the European Coal and Steel Community is coming to an end makes for a negative situation from the point of view of social action and research.
The Commission is charging quite a sum in compensation for earnings from ECSC funds under the guise of managing the investment of the ECSC assets and allocating money for research: EUR 3.5 million a year.
That will pay the salaries of more than 30 officials employed to manage the ECSC' s remaining functions.
The activities involved are so limited in scope that the officials seem to form just one group, which will not suffer from the ECSC' s cessation of operations the way the workers and researchers in the coal and steel industries will.
The Treaty' s cessation will have surprisingly little effect on the lives of the officials who have been attending to the ECSC' s banking business and are managing its effects.
This brings to light the inefficiency of the new organisation of the Commission' s functions.
There is a problem I wish to draw attention to, although it is not strictly relevant to this report.
The legal basis for the Coal and Steel Community Research Fund was established by the Treaty of Nice.
If the Treaty of Nice is not in force next July, there will be no legal basis for any subsequent management of the estate.
The Commission must adopt a position on this swiftly.
Finally, there is good reason to say a few positive words in memory of everything the ECSC has achieved, not least the fact that the European Coal and Steel Community has probably been one of the institutions that had an impact on building peace and international co-operation in Europe after the Second World War.
While it was in operation its Member States did not wage war on each other.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a few days' time, you will be voting at first reading on the amendments to the draft budget as it was drafted by the Council in July.
I already had the honour of making an explanatory statement concerning this draft budget at the part-session in September.
I will therefore not enter into any detail today.
Instead, I should briefly like to outline the aspects which will undoubtedly be on the agenda in the framework of our dialogue.
I hope that this dialogue will be fruitful, so that we can reach an agreement which is satisfactory to everyone, but particularly to the European citizens, of course.
I should like to reiterate quite emphatically that the presidency would like to reach an agreement on the 2002 budget as early as November at second reading of the Council.
A few days after your first reading, the overall structure will be in place and the different positions will be known.
In November, we should consequently be able to put the finishing touches to the activities which will culminate in a sound budget for 2002.
In this connection, it seems useful to me to remind ourselves briefly of the guidelines which the Council used when it compiled the draft budget, in respect of which you will be proposing amendments in the next couple of days.
This draft budget is able to fund all policy components and priorities of the European Union, without imposing too great a burden on the Member States that work towards achieving stricter control of government finances.
At the same time, however, notably under the ceilings of heading 3 of the financial perspectives and of heading 4, it creates some leeway for coping with new priorities.
For that purpose, the Council has made sure that the different actions of the European Union are funded appropriately within the available financial means under the ceilings of the financial perspectives, in connection with which no changes have been made to the funds allocated to programmes on which a decision was made in the codecision procedure, whilst the extent of the commitment appropriations has been determined on the basis of implementation options.
In addition, the Council has paid particular attention to the development of payment appropriations by curbing and controlling their growth compared to 2001. In this context, particular consideration was given to the implementation options and the expected rate of payments in connection with commitments outstanding and national budgetary requirements.
After these general considerations, I should like to broach a few subjects which will be on the agenda in the next couple of weeks and these concern, of course, agricultural expenditure.
As you know, the Council did not adopt the Commission' s proposal at first reading and has asked the Commission for a detailed analysis of the requirements.
During the conciliation meeting of 20 July, Parliament sided with the Council, and I have every faith that, once we have discussed the letter of amendment which the Commission will be sending us shortly, we will reach an agreement through which we will be able to cushion the effects of the different crises.
I think that I can already say that, at the moment, it is becoming increasingly clear that, in this connection, a solution is certainly in the offing.
As far as the other agricultural expenses are concerned, when the Council' s draft budget provided for an increase in the appropriations, although they were still slightly below those which the Commission had initially put forward in its preliminary draft, consideration was given to the effects which the decisions by the European Council of Berlin would have on the reorganisation of the common agricultural policy.
When we analyse the final appropriations to be included in the 2002 budget, we must obviously take account of the most recent data in the letter of amendment concerning agricultural expenditure.
I should now like to turn to a second point which, according to the Interinstitutional Agreement, is also pertinent, in the framework of the letter of amendment which the Commission will be sending us shortly, namely the financial implications of the delay in the fisheries agreement with Morocco, together with the funding and restructuring of the fishing fleet in question.
In July, the Council followed the Commission' s preliminary draft of the budget as far as the international fisheries agreement was concerned, and the Council asked the Commission only to use these appropriations for other fisheries agreements.
It is unfortunate that this position by the Council in July did not lead to an agreement.
With regard to the structural measures, heading 2 of the financial perspectives, the Council insisted on including this entire heading in the budget in the form of commitment appropriations in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council of Berlin of March 1999.
In this connection, I should like to point out that the Council, at the time of compiling its draft budget, did not have a full overview of the situation, and that it stated that it would review the situation in the light of the letter of amendment in the autumn, which is prescribed according to the Interinstitutional Agreement.
The Council will do this as soon as it has received the letter.
I would remind you that the appropriations for international fisheries agreements, in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement, fall within compulsory expenditure, whether they are indicated in the budget line or in the reserve.
As for the letter of amendment, to which some of our discussions in the coming weeks will relate, I should like to note that the Council expects a balance estimate for the 2001 budget year to be included.
This request is an illustration of the principle of good management, which means that the budget burden for the individual European taxpayers will, where possible, not become any heavier.
I know how much importance the European Parliament attaches to the expenditure under heading 3 of the financial perspectives.
That is why the Council has ensured that its draft budget sufficiently covers the priorities of the EU' s internal policy, notably the honouring of commitments concerning the funding of multi-annual programmes, in respect of which both our institutions have taken a decision.
I would also point out that, at first reading, the Council increased appropriations in its draft budget in order to launch Eurojust and the SISII system for Schengen.
The Commission had proposed the budget lines for this in its preliminary draft.
In the current climate, these objectives are more topical than when we compiled the draft budget back in July.
In this way, the Council has created a margin of EUR 110 billion which is wider than the margin in the Commission' s preliminary draft budget.
This margin should be sufficient to cover priorities, some of which, including e-learning and immigration, will undoubtedly be mentioned by your rapporteur or, in any event, will be suggested at our forthcoming dialogue.
I would now like to turn my attention to the funding of the EU' s external measures, as included in heading 4 of the financial perspectives.
The Council has largely followed the Commission' s preliminary draft budget.
The Council has also made an effort to allocate resources to the different priorities in the field of external measures.
For example, the Council has created a margin of EUR 100 million under the ceiling of heading 4 of the financial perspectives, which should enable us to shore up the priorities in this sector.
With regard to this heading 4 of the financial perspectives, I should nevertheless like to point out one particular aspect pertaining to the appropriations for the common foreign and security policy.
I very much regret the fact that, during the conciliation meeting of 20 July involving the European Parliament and the Council, an agreement was still not reached with regard to the level of appropriations to be included.
That is why the Council has adopted the amounts in its draft budget which the Commission proposed in its preliminary draft.
I have to confess that I do not fully grasp why requests for a reduction in these amounts were made.
You will agree with me that these amounts, which are already lower than in 2001, are very modest as they are and are really the bare minimum to ensure that Europe can play a prominent role on the world stage.
The wish to reduce these amounts at such a crucial time as in the current international crisis could particularly harm the EU' s credibility.
I do not believe that that is what is intended.
I should now like to move on to the administrative expenditure of the institutions.
When the Council compiled the draft budget, it was motivated by the wish to meet the needs of the institutions as much as possible, taking into account their specific characteristics.
In the draft budget, there is a surplus left over to the tune of EUR 53 million under the ceiling of heading 5 of the financial perspectives, which allows new needs in the field of administrative expenditure, notably for the budget of the European data protection supervisor, to be accommodated.
In this connection, the Council recently sent you its letter of amendment No 1 for 2002.
Despite this, I am of the opinion that each of the institutions represented here are acutely aware of the pressure which the ceilings of heading 5 are under.
A first step in this connection was the agreement that was reached during the conciliation meeting of 20 July involving the European Parliament and the Council concerning a request to the Secretaries-General of the institutions to compile a report for the benefit of the budgetary authority by the time the Budgetary Council is held in November. This report should comprise a multi-annual analysis of heading 5, as well as proposals concerning necessary economy measures to prevent the maximum allocated to this heading being exceeded, also in the framework of enlargement.
In the light of this report, the follow-up action that needs to be taken should subsequently be determined.
I should already like to underline that a number of suggestions made a moment ago in connection with the report are certainly worth looking at further.
I should also like to mention another aspect concerning administrative expenditure, notably the Commission' s staffing requests.
The Council continues to support the reforms on which the Commission is working, and agreed at first reading to the creation of 78 new offices requested by the external delegations in the framework of decentralisation.
With regard to the other 239 offices, the Council failed to adopt a position on 20 July because, on the one hand, it requires more clarity concerning the decision on the regulation for the definitive termination of service by Commission officials and, on the other hand, it nurses the hope that your discussions on this matter will yield a solution which can accommodate our respective wishes.
I should like to finish this list of the different points which will be occupying our minds for the next couple of weeks by returning to a question with which you are all too familiar, namely the extent of payment appropriations.
First of all, I am delighted that the European Parliament and the Commission share the Council' s concern as to the commitments outstanding (in our Community jargon also known as the 'RAL' ).
The progress report of 30 June 2001, requested by the Commission in the framework of the previous budgetary procedure, is certainly useful in this connection.
However, I should like to point out that the vast increase in payment appropriations is not a cure-all for RAL absorption.
This is evident from the extent of the balances over the past budget years which were repaid to the Member States.
On the one hand, there will still be commitments outstanding as a logical extension of the split appropriations, while, on the other hand, the improved follow-up of the commitment appropriations, notably by an opt-out policy, is also an effective means of absorbing potentially abnormal RALs.
As to the extent of payment appropriations in the draft budget, the Council has expressed a preference for limited and controlled growth.
Indeed, the Council is striving to include payment appropriations which correspond to the actual implementation options.
In this way, we prevent the individual European taxpayers from being faced with too heavy a burden.
I have given you a brief outline of the points which will undoubtedly be the topic of discussion over the next couple of weeks.
The seriousness with which the Commission and the two arms of the budgetary authority are treating the start of this new budgetary procedure is obvious to me, and a source of real pleasure to me.
It is my wish for the budgetary discussions, after you have cast your votes in a couple of days, to be continued in the same spirit and, if possible, for agreement to be reached as early as November about a budget of the European Communities for the 2002 budget year which will provide us with the resources to meet the priorities and challenges which the European Union will be facing shortly.
Mr President, honourable Members, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, planning the Budget for next year demands flexibility and provision for the unforeseen.
Flexibility and provision for a rapid and appropriate response to new financial demands on the European Union and on a common European policy.
The current year has indeed shown what demands can be made on a budget, demands that cannot be planned for or envisaged in advance.
We had the BSE crisis and foot-and-mouth disease, we now have the new Global Health Fund project that has come into being this year, greater demands are being made on our humanitarian aid, not only in Afghanistan, but also because of the escalating situation in the Middle East; Palestine's dependency on external aid, including from Europe, has continually increased.
The EU's budget quite clearly needs the capacity to respond to crises and to surmount them, and we have - I believe - managed in the past two years to draft the Budget so as to cope with this demand.
I am optimistic that we will manage it for next year too.
At this point, I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to thank the rapporteurs for the 2002 Budget, first of all you, Mr Costa Neves, but also Mrs Buitenweg, Mr Seppänen and of course the entire Committee on Budgets for the work you have put in.
Anyone who has seen the mountains of amendments that the Committee on Budgets again had to get to grips with this year, will know what is meant by hard committee work.
There is, though, a great deal of work ahead of us, and we have a long way to go.
Flexibility and willingness to compromise are required of us all.
Of course, I know that the Belgian Presidency of the Council is endeavouring to pass a good EU Budget, which will fulfil all requirements.
I thank you, Mr Vande Lanotte, for re-emphasising in your speech this aspect - the willingness to negotiate - for I believe that this demand must also be addressed to the Council, that flexibility is necessary in negotiations and that what is said in the various sittings must not be merely a repetition of what was decided by governments in the capitals.
It is just at the point where the Committee on Budgets does not want to respond to increased responsibility and to greater demands with an expanding budget, that our proceedings need flexibility.
I intend now to discuss individual aspects of the European Budget, beginning with agriculture.
The Commission's preliminary draft for the budget, which we presented at the end of May, planned for a EUR 1 billion reserve to facilitate a response to the demands of the BSE crisis and foot-and-mouth disease.
We have now moved on a bit, and the Commission will next week be adopting the letter of amendment.
Developments in the livestock sector have turned out, thank God, to be less dramatic than had at first been feared.
We have indeed managed to put aside EUR 400 million from the Budget in this year already for the costs of foot-and-mouth disease.
The consequence of this will be that we have to plan for less of an increase for foot-and-mouth in the Amending Budget for next year than had at first been feared.
This means that current developments make it possible for us to release the reserve we had proposed in May.
There are, however, developments in some areas of the agricultural sector that still give cause for concern from the budgetary point of view.
The key word here is 'wine' .
Here, there is a production surplus whose constant increase is reflected in the financial results.
Expenditure in this field has, in the meantime, doubled in two years, with the natural consequence that we have to observe carefully what steps can be taken to stem this overproduction and slow down the growth in the agricultural budget.
The letter of amendment that we will be laying before you concludes by saying that we can release the reserve and that we require less expenditure on agriculture than our calculations had originally provided for, so that a fairly substantial margin remains.
At this point, I must however state quite clearly that agriculture ministers must not take this margin to mean that there is plenty of scope for every kind of shiny new expenditure package; this year has shown how quickly such a margin can be required for things which could not have been planned for.
So, in my judgment, caution demands that we keep this margin in this area.
I might mention in passing that I welcome the fact that the Committee on Budget's various amendments and resolutions show its desire to look into the agricultural sector more deeply, including with regard to the Midterm Review, which is due next year.
We do have an agricultural aid programme for the acceding countries, which I would now like to mention briefly, namely the SAPARD pre-accession instrument.
I share your absolute dissatisfaction with this programme not yet having, so to speak 'arrived' , in the sense of aid payments being able to be made from it for agriculture, and with our still being at this preliminary stage in which the appropriate administrative structures are being set up.
Of course it is important to have absolute control, and certainty that nothing will go wrong, but if this leads to the other extreme of the programme not working at all, then that is not what its inventor had in mind either.
You have now, in this Parliament, come to the logical conclusion and said that a new stage in the programme is to be set up, in particular to finance information for the agricultural sector about the EU's future agricultural policy.
I must now, despite this, ask you to please reconsider this proposal, which would mean that we would have to create a new legal basis for this programme.
All of SAPARD's components would have to be reprogrammed, with even greater delays as a consequence.
That cannot be what you meant.
Hence my plea to you to negotiate it again with great precision, in order to find room in SAPARD for your demand for more information along the lines of the LEADER programme to be made available for rural areas.
On this point I must also address a few words to the Council: In your first reading of the preliminary draft of the Budget, you made substantial cuts in the means of payment for the pre-accession aid packages.
It is of course contradictory to say on the one hand that we want better implementation and a reduced backlog of payments, and on the other to cut funds so drastically.
So I must ask you to keep an open mind on the Commission's reasoning.
Of course we have to produce evidence that next year we will need the items we have proposed, but that we shall surely do.
Coming to the topic of enlargement, I, of course, have to mention the 'frontier regions' , as Mr Costa Neves, the rapporteur, has already done.
Of course we all know that the frontier regions, the regions that are at present situated on the borders of the European Union, will profit in the long term from the enlargement of the EU, because they will at last be frontier regions no longer.
Despite this, we also know, on the other hand, that there are problems with adjustment.
In order to absorb the impact of these, or, to put it the other way around, to work towards making use of the opportunities that will be available, the Commission has proposed this programme for the frontier regions.
The Budget provides for an additional EUR 150 million to be made available for transport infrastructure measures in the frontier regions and for a further EUR 15 million for cooperation with small and medium-sized enterprises, an additional EUR 20 million from the INTERREG programme and EUR 10 million more from the youth programme, in order to promote this programme for school students' exchanges and so on in the perspective of enlargement.
Last year, Parliament had adopted, for the 2001 Budget, the new pilot project "Cooperation with small and medium-sized enterprises in the frontier regions with a view to enlargement".
I have to say, with the benefit of hindsight, that this was an excellent idea of Parliament's, as a great deal can now be done with this programme.
I welcome Parliament's statement that this project should continue to be supported, and I, of course, follow with interest, Parliament's endeavours to activate supplementary funds for this area as a whole.
Mounting demands on European policy, of course, also mean that greater demands are made on personnel and also on the Commission's staff.
For years, the Commission has faced ever-increasing tasks which have had to be dealt with without additional human resources.
Last year, this brought us to the conclusion that we would have to take stock by analysing our workload.
As a result of this, we presented a claim for 717 new posts.
The budgetary authority approved 400 additional posts for the Commission last year.
Let me take this as an opportunity to thank you again for this on behalf of the Commission.
We also ask for approval of the second tranche of 317 posts, however.
I would again point out that some departments are really not lavishly provided for.
To take only one example, that of Mr Vitorino's Justice and Home Affairs Directorate-General.
It has 189 established posts.
The temporary posts bring the total to 215.
The Scoreboard for more intensive cooperation in judicial matters decided on in Tampere, is really not a bad thing.
Indeed, it is, of course, justified.
The post-11 September situation has now shown that it is in the field of more intensive judicial cooperation that joint action is required.
Not enough has yet been done about this at European level.
We must, therefore, make the effort to move forward in this area, which means, of course, a need for staff to work in this field.
I wish to thank you for your support for the Commission's reforms as a whole, which you have reiterated here today.
You have now tabled various amendments which you will probably adopt on Thursday, and the Commission, in consequence, will be asked for further reports, for example on the delayed presentation of the Budget.
We will of course do all in our power to satisfy this demand for reports.
I must also point out that the Commission has responsibilities as an executive, and so it is also necessary to find a balance.
I would, though, like to thank Mr Costa Neves for reiterating your offer of negotiations.
Ladies and gentlemen, the ability to use budgetary policy to react to crises and intercept the unexpected is of course particularly necessary in the field of foreign policy.
This was true when we had to work together to find the wherewithal for the reconstruction of Kosovo and incorporate it into the 2000 Budget.
Together, we managed it.
It was the case last year, when additional funds for Serbia had to be added to the 2001 Budget.
As I have already mentioned, we are now in a situation in which a contribution is to be made from the European Budget to the Global Health Fund.
We are talking in terms of EUR 60 million for this.
We will be presenting to Parliament the relevant proposal for a transfer, in order to use the fisheries reserve, which is still in this Budget, for this purpose among others.
When we sat together in our three-way talks last week, you supported making EUR 25 million from the emergency humanitarian aid reserve available for Afghanistan, EUR 7.5 million for Palestine and EUR 7.5 million for the Caucasus region.
That shows what current demands are.
I would like to return to one point in particular, which you, Mr President-in-office of the Council, mentioned: I refer to the funds for the common foreign and security policy.
Public opinion sometimes misunderstands this and takes it to mean that this is the only budget line where foreign policy is concerned.
On the contrary, of course other measures are of a foreign policy nature, that is quite clear.
We have, though, this specific line for the common foreign and security policy.
The Commission has proposed EUR 35 million for it.
Parliament proposed its reduction by EUR 14 million.
Now we have to give more careful consideration to precisely why.
Parliament does not, indeed, believe this to be an unimportant area; it is far more a question of how decisions are reached, of whether it is actually right that the Council should have sole discretion as to how the funds are applied.
We note - I note in my capacity as Commissioner for the Budget - that this principle, according to which the Council decides on the use to which funds are put and the Commission then writes the cheques out, does not work well, as there has to date been under-utilisation in this area, even though everybody knows what demands are made.
I believe we have to talk about the fundamentals of how future finance for the common foreign and security policy is to be secured, quite independently of the 2002 Budget.
In my judgment, it is not tolerable that the Council attempts to appropriate ever more operational duties in this area; we need, on the contrary, a common foreign and security policy that will also provide the necessary financial security.
There are a whole lot of related issues to be sorted out.
We must also consider the people's expectations in this area when we really thoroughly discuss, investigate and then define, what we want to do in future.
This demands a common response and, I believe, in many respects a stronger Community response.
To return to the Budget for 2002: the Commission had until now envisaged a EUR 125 million reserve for the fisheries agreement with Morocco.
That fisheries agreement has now finally collapsed.
In the letter of amendment that the Commission will be discussing next week and then presenting to you in due time, this reserve is released.
The funds will be used in part for other fisheries agreements, which have been extended.
A large amount will become available.
I would say it would be a mistake to budget all these additional funds which have become available from the reserve, at this early stage.
I know we are going to need this money.
It is not a matter of saving this money but - and I urge this - not already allocating it all.
Why do I urge this?
Let me now make only one point: battle is at present being waged in Afghanistan against international terrorism, and the European Union is keeping humanitarian aid in readiness for the civilian population, and the amounts involved are not small.
The European Union will be providing a total of over EUR 310 million.
Let me also, however, point out that the USA was a great donor of funds for humanitarian aid in Afghanistan even before 11 September.
Now, though, we should already be thinking of what the period after this conflict will mean for the region and for the country of Afghanistan, and it is quite clear to me that this means the post-Taliban era in Afghanistan.
I think we can all agree that the European Union will then also have an obligation and a responsibility to build up a democratic society, a society that has regard for human rights and makes it possible to live with human dignity.
In this Budget, we should make provision in such a way as to enable us to meet this obligation financially as in other ways.
Looking back over two years as Budget Commissioner and on two years of Budget discussions with Parliament and the Council, I can truly say that the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have together managed to meet well the demands made on the European Budget, and I am very optimistic that we will achieve this again for 2002.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the general rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets, Mr Costa Neves, for his efforts to reconcile the different interests in this House.
Mr President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would like to remind you that we are at the first reading stage, which, although this seems obvious at first sight, makes it clear that many of the balances and agreements we must achieve will be of a general nature and will have repercussions upon the final appropriations under this heading.
In this context, I would like to give a vote of confidence to the general rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets, as long as he, of course, takes on board to the greatest extent possible the priorities set out by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which are balanced, given that they seek an equitable distribution between different geographical areas, and aim to respond to the European Union' s various commitments on the international stage.
The Commissioner referred to the finely balanced measures we have had to take in the last few years: Commissioner, we cannot continue in such an unmethodical fashion, we cannot continue to finance new priorities with the same resources.
I understand that this is not an exercise in revising financial perspectives, but we cannot continually take on new priorities to the detriment of the commitments that the European Union has already made.
We will have to look for formulae that are more imaginative and more creative in this area.
Mr President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs has given its opinion: we want to strengthen the Commission' s administrative reform policy, particularly with regard to the decentralised management of external aid.
With regard to the proposals made by Commissioner Patten, the Committee on Foreign Affairs has expressed its strong support on this matter.
In conclusion, the Committee on Foreign Affairs gives its support and vote of confidence to the general rapporteur from the Committee on Budgets, Mr Costa Neves, we affectionately urge him to pay very close attention to the objectives that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has set out in its opinion for this 2002 budget.
.
On behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I would also like to offer my congratulations to Mr Costa Neves for guiding us so far and for the very good job that he has done.
I have been asked by my committee to raise a number of points, the main one being the amendment that we are retabling on the Court of Auditors.
As the House will know, the Court of Auditors asked for a number of new staff.
The Council recommended that only five new staff be granted and various positions have been taken on the additional staff requested and the money for them.
The Committee on Budgetary Control decided quite wisely, in my view, that we should take an apolitical stance on this.
We should ask the Court of Auditors to assess the performance of financial control systems in the applicant countries; improve the Court of Auditors' cooperation with the national audit institutions - which is a requirement of the Treaty of Nice - and establish more detailed specific DAS assessments - again, a requirement of the Treaty of Nice.
We would therefore be fairly apolitical and once those issues had been clarified, we would ask for the money to be released for the other posts.
However, in the Committee on Budgets a completely different amendment was tabled.
It is much more political, and we are very worried about the independence of the Court of Auditors in relation to the requirements set down by the Committee on Budgets, so I do hope that will be considered.
I have also been asked to say a word about implementation.
We have looked at the implementation figures and we will continue to look at them in the future and use them for future amendments to the budget.
You have our full backing on everything you have done in getting better information on implementation for us so far.
We have also looked at tabling amendments.
We have an amendment coming through asking for money to be tied up and asking the Commission to tell us whether an evaluation unit has been set up in DG V.
Finally, we are very concerned about the future of the A-30 lines, or rather how they are going to be spent.
Those are the points that the Committee on Budgetary Control would like to raise.
Mr President, on behalf of my Committee, I would like to emphasise one point, namely the PRINCE programme.
We see it as very important that the information campaign on the euro should be carried on for another half-year, for we find an information deficit here despite great campaigning efforts.
It is particularly marked among small and medium-sized enterprises, and this programme is intended to make good this deficit.
As permanent rapporteur for the agencies, I can say at the present time that the most acute problems have been resolved with the help not only of our colleagues in the Committee on Budgets, but also that of the general rapporteur.
We decided, on the basis of the facts, to consider the agencies individually.
I would therefore like to take this opportunity to say a few things for future reference.
The agencies carry on growing, as they have done for years.
Everyone who works in one seems to have a vested interest in the agencies' expansion.
To give an example, between 1995 and 2001, the personnel complement of the agencies increased by 366%.
We are creating another 99 posts this year alone.
I get the impression that many of the European agencies maintain to some degree a separate existence.
In the Budget procedure, we always have to deal with one demand - they say they need more money.
The consequences of this development are clear to see.
The agencies take up all the scope for other programmes, and at some point the Community ends up having to pay the pension costs as well.
We must make changes here.
No longer must the Budget be adapted to the programmes decided on by the Management Board, but the programmes must fit the resources provided by the Budget.
We need a working audit of the agencies, involving all the actors concerned on a permanent basis. In other words, Parliament's specialised committees must likewise carry out an evaluation.
We urgently need to examine the question of whether the services provided by the agencies are actually needed and then put to good use.
The Budgetary Control Committee, the Court of Auditors and all the other actors must be involved in helping us get a grip on the whole thing.
Over the coming weeks, I will be attempting to create a structure for this purpose, one which can be put to use in the next Budget procedure.
Mr President, I am going to combine my time as rapporteur for the Committee on Industry and spokesperson for the Socialists on the other institutions.
Firstly, I congratulate both the rapporteurs for successfully completing the mammoth budgetary task, and also the chairman of the committee, Mr Wynn, for getting through the votes in record time.
Speaking on behalf of the Committee on Industry, I am disappointed with the outcomes in this budget because many of the priorities which we highlighted have been totally ignored.
Let me single out three issues.
The e-Europe initiative, launched with much fanfare at Lisbon, highlighted how it would increase the competitiveness of European industry; increase employment opportunities; and acknowledge that a knowledge society is indisputably a fundamental prerequisite for future economic prosperity.
The extension of e-Europe to the applicant countries was again much heralded at Stockholm, but we are proposing not to extend this programme.
I would like to remind everybody that the Council and Parliament confirmed e-Europe as a priority.
By not supporting it we are undermining one of Europe's priority programmes and this will be to the detriment of the applicant countries.
We need to ensure, as the rapporteur stated, that rhetoric is matched by action, that the EU citizen is not left to ponder.
We have all these programmes; they are acclaimed; and then they seem to dissipate into thin air!
This applies equally to my second point on Save.
This has been a parliamentary priority for a number of years.
Here we have a proposal to decrease the funding for the coming year.
An environmentally-friendly European energy policy is at the top of most people's agendas and it is important that Europe leads the way in our Kyoto obligations.
Therefore, to reduce programmes that promote sustainable energy consumption and impact on climate protection is extremely short-sighted.
The third area in which the Committee on Industry will be retabling amendments is the decommissioning of weapons of mass destruction, and waste management.
These are key to promoting a safer world.
This is even more critical in the light of the recent atrocities of 11 September and to ensure that states have a proper strategy for dismantling chemical weapons so that there are no opportunities for these weapons to fall into the wrong hands.
I would urge the rapporteur to rethink and support these amendments.
Moving on to the other institutions, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, for the open and inclusive approach she adopted in arriving at the budget for the other institutions.
This year, as she said, Heading 5 was under tremendous pressure for a number of reasons, including the preparation for the forthcoming enlargement.
My group's efforts have been to continue to improve effectiveness, efficiency and transparency.
As far as Parliament is concerned, these are not just hollow words, but words of substance.
We have demonstrated our commitment to improving efficiency by staying under Parliament's 20% self-imposed ceiling, whilst absorbing the costs of preparations for enlargement of some EUR 18 million.
However, this will be extremely difficult in the coming years.
I would urge the Council to address this, so that the costs associated with the proposed enlargement are dealt with before we commence the budgetary procedure next year.
Furthermore, I welcome the three-year enlargement plan that the Bureau has approved.
At this stage, it is fairly sketchy and perhaps conservative - with a small 'c' - and not very radical.
This is a shame because enlargement offers a real opportunity to make Parliament more dynamic in its operation.
Some of the ideas outlined in this plan need to be developed further and we need to have a broader view of how things are done.
Yesterday we heard in plenary that Parliament was unable to look at the money laundering proposals, which were agreed by the Council, for another three weeks because of the need for translation into 11 languages.
This is extremely frustrating for everybody concerned, but what will this mean when we have 10 more languages?
We must address this issue because it causes us fundamental problems in terms of the image of Parliament.
It creates negative perceptions in the minds of European citizens, in that the European Parliament is seen as undynamic and unresponsive.
Whilst we are on the subject of radical thinking, I would like to make some suggestions to the Council to improve their own efficiency.
The under-utilisation of Parliament's buildings, for instance.
We have buildings in Brussels which are almost empty for one week every month, and a building in Strasbourg which is hardly used and remains empty for three weeks a month.
As the Council is consistently pointing out waste, here is an offer it cannot refuse.
It could share and make full use of our buildings by holding its meetings in our buildings.
I hope that will also benefit transparency in the way it works.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Mr President, we on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy this year can generally welcome the progress that has been made so far in formulating the budget for next year.
Looking back historically, we are doing a better job every year and this is certainly due partly to the work done by the rapporteurs.
Things are going along much more smoothly than they were, despite the fact that we are considerably squeezed for money because of external demands upon our budget.
Nevertheless, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Budgets has supported the view of Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in restoring some of the budget lines which we are particularly concerned with, at least to the level of the PDB.
Also, it is worth mentioning that we look with approval upon the work that was done in terms of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets with regard to the tobacco subsidies.
They urge the Council to take a good look at this.
We urge the Commission to take a good look at this.
We know something must be done.
I am pleased that the Committee on Budgets acknowledges this.
Its proposals for a gradual reduction over a period of time of that subsidy make sense, and it is time the Council and the Commission started talking about this issue.
One particular success is on the issue of the budget line associated with the approval of orphan drugs by the medicines agency.
I am very pleased the Committee on Budgets has accepted our point of view and I hope the Commission does as well.
This has been a very successful budget line since created last year together with the SAB procedure.
We were concerned about what the Council wanted to do in terms of the massive cut it demanded in that line, which was completely unjustified.
We are pleased about the restoration to an appropriate level of that budget line and we hope the Commission will also defend that point of view to the Council.
This is a budget line which does genuinely good work for the people of Europe and brings real and genuine benefits and it must be protected.
Finally, I would say that we have some concerns about the way in which the agencies have been handled.
I can fully understand why money must go into the reserve and I can fully understand why there is increasing concern about the way the agencies operate, but we need to give them the appropriate resources to do their job and that particularly applies in the case of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Agriculture Committee wishes to address the Council and express its fundamental opposition to the cuts across the board that the Council is always making.
We see this, in political terms, as a rather unimaginative way of handling Budget guidelines.
We are working on the assumption that the letter of amendment will be the right basis on which to adjust individual areas in preparation for second reading.
Apart from that, we hold to our demand for agricultural expenditure to be made more flexible in future by enabling the transfer of funds from the mandatory to the discretionary division.
We know how complicated that is and how many changes have to be made, but we will carry on demanding this whenever budgets are laid before us, until our demands have been met.
The Commission's proposal on the introduction of a reserve meets with our explicit support.
That is needed.
We are sure that we do not have to explain why it is necessary.
We also assume that the Commission will act responsibly if it becomes necessary to make use of it.
Our colleagues on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have just spoken about tobacco.
We too on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have had to return to the tobacco issue.
We are most dissatisfied with the inadequate use being made of money from the Tobacco Research Fund.
On the Agriculture Committee, we, too, are fed up with forever flogging a dead horse where this subject is concerned.
We have, on the one hand, the demand for preventative health education, and, on the other, the need to promote tobacco growing.
We must, though, face reality.
For as long as we have farmers who grow tobacco - and they are not the richest - and have no alternative crop to offer them, we cannot help them.
This sector therefore needs possible alternatives not only to be examined, but also offered.
Most of all, I would like to say something more about SAPARD: we are glad that the appropriations have been increased, but, like the Commissioner, we are critical of the way the Council has cut by EUR 100 million the amount of funds SAPARD is authorised to pay out.
This is not on!
It is absolutely not on!
Please, Commissioner, let there be no fear of a new implementation along the lines of LEADER.
Take your courage in both hands!
Let me take this opportunity to thank the general rapporteur for working so well with me and my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee.
Mr President, to begin with, I should like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, for offering such close and constructive cooperation.
That does not mean that he was able to agree on all counts as far as the fisheries budget is concerned, but he listened carefully to everything we had to say and created, in any event, a basis for further collaboration, which we found useful.
The huge problems in the fisheries sector and the partial failure of the common fisheries policy have left their mark on the fisheries budget.
Clearly, the multi-annual orientation programme and the unilateral closure of areas have not proved successful.
Failure to conclude a new fisheries agreement with Morocco has led to an explosive situation along the Spanish and Portuguese coasts, an area which is already facing major social problems in connection with illegal immigration.
It is for that reason that the Committee on Fisheries has asked for nearly EUR 200 million in order to be able to tackle these problems.
The rapporteur suggests including a token entry first and challenging the Council to meet the pledges made in Nice.
The Committee on Fisheries endorses this view.
However, the Committee on Fisheries is disappointed by the fact that the budget proposal for more money for quota control, which was desperately needed, has been watered down by a liberal amendment in the Committee on Budgets, while the original amendment did receive wide support from all groups in the Committee on Fisheries with this proposal.
In the capacity as shadow rapporteur of the PPE-DE Group for the agricultural budget, I note that, of the original request for EUR 1 billion extra for food safety and animal disease control, eventually 580 million was left over, but what we say is: better some of a pudding than none of a pie.
In actual fact, we also regret to some extent the Commission' s failure to adhere to the original request for EUR 1 billion extra.
Fortunately, the PPE-DE position, that more money must be earmarked for animal disease control, has met with approval.
In general, we are of the opinion that, in order to restore consumer confidence, it is vital to bring the European markets, including those for beef, back to normal.
As a final point, I have to say that I am delighted with the fact that, with regard to foreign policy, the PPE-DE Group will be tabling an amendment for more attention for Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tadjikistan, and I should also like to recommend this amendment warmly for further discussions.
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on behalf of whom I am speaking, put forward ten or so amendments to the draft budget with regard to the four Community initiatives (URBAN, INTERREG, EQUAL and LEADER), for safety and sustainability in transport and tourism.
Despite the current circumstances following the tragic events of 11 September, tourism will soon be the largest service industry in the European Union.
The World Tourism Organisation anticipates a doubling in the number of tourist arrivals up to a figure of approximately 720 million per year by the year 2020.
The 9 million people who already work in the tourism industry will be joined by a further 2 to 3.5 million between now and 2010, to reach 12.5 million people employed.
The Committee on Budgets, however, rejected our proposals.
Fortunately, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has once again been able to put forward an amendment to this House so that, at European level, resources are assigned to stimulate the promotion, monitoring and evaluation of a tourism policy that is both ecological and socially sustainable.
I trust that the majority of my fellow Members here will have the sensitivity necessary to support this reaffirmed proposal with their vote.
Mr President, the budget of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport contains three important new features:
Firstly, a separate appropriation of EUR 12.6 million is being proposed for the implementation of the elearning initiative.
It is justified because IT studies have a key place in the EU' s strategy.
A considerable increase in the appropriation for IT teaching would also be wise, as if it is to be financed merely from the Socrates, YOUTH and Culture 2000 programmes this might put the implementation of the fundamental aims of these programmes in jeopardy.
We have to remember that information technology is a tool, not an absolute value.
The second new feature is connected with sport, which still does not have a legal basis in the Union.
Sport is mentioned, however, in the Treaty of Amsterdam, and the conclusions of the Nice Summit stressed its social importance.
The Committee on Budgets has approved a proposal for a EUR 5 million appropriation for sports club work to prevent exclusion amongst youth.
The third new matter in our Committee' s budget is the EUR 1 million appropriation for establishing a centre for monitoring cultural co-operation.
In my opinion, the co-ordination of cultural co-operation could be practised in association with the Council of Europe, which has much experience in the field.
Chapter A-30 again caused problems.
I am very disappointed with the work of the Committee on Budgets in item A-3042, which concerns the funding of European cultural organisations.
We in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport had done a lot of work in connection with this point.
We took the Commission' s report on the funding of organisations into account as well as the recommendations of the Committee on Budgets' working party.
We, above all, tried to assess how money might be used in the best possible way from the point of view of European culture.
I cannot accept that the Committee on Budgets has interfered with a proposal that required the expertise of a special committee the way it has.
I warmly support the proposal contained in the report drafted by Mr Costa Neves for a legal basis and proper rules to apply to A-30.
Parliament cannot act as if it were in a 'grab as grab can' type of wrestling contest, in which the most unscrupulous party of all is the victor.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Vande Lanotte, I would like to draw your attention to the three amendments tabled by Parliament' s Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
The aim of these amendments is to enhance the information given to citizens and to stimulate the debate on issues relating to the future of the European Union, pursuant to Declaration 23 of the Treaty of Nice.
The aim of Amendment No 223 is to restore the commitment appropriations granted to the Prince-Programme, as proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget.
The increase in these appropriations has, in fact, been reduced by the Council.
We feel it is inconceivable not to support strong investment to provide more information for the public on the euro, enlargement, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and, of course, on measures in the area of justice and home affairs.
All these subjects are extremely topical.
I would also like to reiterate that we are already involved in a period of reflection and consultation on the future of the European Union.
We also believe that it would be counter-productive to enter, as suggested by the Committee on Budgets, a part of these appropriations into a reserve.
We know that using the appropriations entered in the reserve is a much more complicated procedure, and we see no reason why the Commission' s room for manoeuvre should be hampered in this area.
I would add that, in any case, monitoring is undertaken by Parliament by means of its presence within the inter-institutional working party on general and specific information.
Lastly, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has also expressed its support for maintaining, and even increasing the financial support given to the European Movement.
We know that this Movement' s actions are effective, and it would be surprising if the European Union withdraws its support for the European Movement at a time when we need, more than ever, to encourage dialogue with the citizens.
Furthermore, all Member States should support European Union day, which is organised for 9 May, as this would greatly contribute to developing the rapport with the public that is severely lacking.
Mr President, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, both the powers of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities and, in particular, European Union policies that promote equality of the sexes, in which particular emphasis is given to the Community programme for equal opportunities as a fundamentally important instrument in the struggle for equality, have been strengthened, as have the Daphne programme against domestic violence, and the Equal programme to encourage the incorporation of women into the labour market and compliance with the employment objectives of the Lisbon Summit, to name but a few.
Social exclusion is another concern of the Committee on Women' s Rights, given that we are unfortunately witnessing the phenomenon of the 'feminisation of poverty' .
In order to achieve these priority objectives, we have put forward a series of amendments to the budget, which have been well received, and I would like to give special thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, for his support in obtaining a majority in the Committee on Budgets.
A small proportion has been rejected, because it was already included in other budget lines: information actions in the common agricultural policy; methods to combat exclusion; the information society; the fight against poverty and the illnesses that arise as a result of it: malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS; care in the field of health and welfare; consolidation of democracy and human rights, etc.
Aid for women' s organisations that work for the promotion of women in the European Union should also be pointed out, not only the women' s lobby, but also other organisations that monitor the respect for pluralism in our society.
We cannot affirm that one sole organisation represents all of Europe' s women.
This action is therefore intended to promote justice and recognition for many other European organisations that have been working towards the equality of the sexes for a long time now, which also have a right to receive financial aid from the European Union.
The Committee on Women' s Rights is therefore very pleased that the rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets has accepted its proposals.
Mr President, I apologise to the rapporteurs that I was not able to be here at the beginning of the debate, but I would wager a euro that nobody has yet touched on the subject that I will raise on behalf of the Committee on Petitions.
Deep in the Buitenweg report is Amendment No 2022 on Budget Line 250 and this makes a new proposal to allow in certain circumstances, individual expenses to be paid to particular petitioners if they feel it appropriate to come to Parliament to put their case.
I want to thank the rapporteur for accepting this report and the committee for passing it.
Parliaments, you know, have various responsibilities.
They decide who is to be the government, of course, that is not a responsibility of this Parliament.
They decide budgets, but you know, we have only partial budgetary powers.
We have no powers over taxation, we have no powers over 50% of the expenditure more or less devoted to agriculture.
Parliaments decide legislation: that is a power we have to share with the Council of Ministers and we have no powers of legislative initiative.
But parliaments also have a responsibility to protect the rights of the individual citizens in dealing with the bureaucracy and that is a responsibility that we discharge in this Parliament through the work of the Committee on Petitions and the work of the Ombudsman.
I would say to Parliament this afternoon that the money spent on petitions and the EUR 3 million that we make available to the Office of the Ombudsman is money that is extremely well spent.
It works out at less than EUR 0.1 per person per annum, so it cannot be said to be a great deal of money, but it is money that is being spent on real European democracy and we want to ensure that we keep that up and that we see that we do more in future years.
Mr President, I shall concentrate in particular upon the remarks on the ECSC' s operating budget, in which context I shall talk about the report issued by Mr Seppänen on behalf of the Committee on Budgets.
We are pleased about the role played by the ECSC as a pioneer in the European integration process and about the way in which the ECSC has made a positive contribution to peace in Europe.
We note that the ECSC was financed by means of revenue of a fiscal nature which facilitated the development of economic and social intervention measures associated with sectoral industrial policies.
At present, the coal and steel sector employs 357 000 workers and, as we enlarge the EU by means of the candidate countries, enlargement will mean that coal production in the EU will be doubled and that steel production will be increased by a third.
We can note with pride that, thanks to the ECSC, something was constructed and further developed that led to the European Union as we know it today.
The Committee has approved the Commission' s draft operating budget of EUR 151.8 million in 2002, and it is of course on 23 July 2002 that the ECSC Treaty expires.
We might have wished that, when it came to both operations and research, there had been a little more money for future energy needs relating to clean coal technologies, and we call upon the Commission to take account of this in the other programmes.
Mr President, I would like to put a question to you.
I do not understand why, when I am the official draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, when I prepared the amendments tabled by my Committee, when I arranged the vote on these in my Committee, when I defended them, rather vigorously at times, in the Committee on Budgets - where, in most cases, I also managed to obtain the approval of my fellow Members - why, therefore, my name is not on the list of draftsmen due to speak.
I, therefore, ask permission to take the floor now, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms.
Mr Deprez, your name does not appear on the official list of Members allowed to present committee opinions and I am, therefore, unable to give you the floor at this time.
I shall therefore request permission to take the floor now, Mr President.
Mr Deprez, the list of speakers is produced from the official requests presented by the various committees on behalf of which one can speak.
Since your name is not on the official list and as I see no reason for this to be changed, I shall give you the floor later, when you do have the right to make a speech.
President, our spokesman will be speaking for our Group later, but I also have a few comments to make at this stage.
As other speakers have already done, I should like to congratulate our two main rapporteurs, Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg.
It is never an easy job to steer something through this House, as I know, and I think that they should be warmly applauded.
With the Commission budget this year, we have a proposal in front of us which, at 1.06% of GDP, is one of lowest budgets we have seen proposed in this House and therefore well below the ceiling as foreseen in the Financial Perspective, but I guess that with enlargement on its way, the Financial Perspective could well be tested before we reach the end of 2006.

In referring to the Costa Neves Report, I should like, first of all, to congratulate the rapporteur on having focused on the progress report, on what had been done in terms of following up on the Joint Council/Parliament Declaration at the end of last year which has shown its worth in our budgetary procedure.
It may well be a useful idea to think of continuing this on an annual basis, because where we have gained is looking at the efficiency and effectiveness of the operations of the European institutions, and this for us in Parliament is a point of major importance which I shall come back to at the end of my speech.
I should like to raise a few points on the particular matters of the Commission budget where we would, as a group, be looking for value for money - a tried and tested position with us.

Firstly, in terms of agriculture: we do not believe in having a reserve - we already have some money which has already been made available and a letter of amendment on its way, and I feel that it is quite sufficient.
But we think there should be an enquiry into the management of foot-and-mouth by the Commission and the British authorities, and we will be pushing for that.

Secondly, we believe that in information policy there is a continuing problem: every time we see Commission proposals come through without the interinstitutional working groups, we as a Parliament have to put them back on the information policy lines.
I urge the Commission to make sure that they become a permanent part of your proposals - this will save some effort on our part to ensure that this interinstitutional work is continued.
Thirdly, in terms of the food safety agency - I noted that was raised in the European Council in Ghent - I would remind the President-in-Office (instead of laughing, he might listen to parliamentarians when they are speaking) that Parliament's position is that the money will stay in reserve until we are satisfied about the operations and the location of this agency.
I therefore assume that you will consult Parliament before any final decision is taken.
Fourthly, as regards Afghanistan - and I turn to the Commission again here - there is an amendment down to create a 'pour memoire' entry for aid to Afghanistan, and we will be asking the Council with Parliament to put this into the budget on second reading because we want to see in our Group that there will be an international alliance to help the reconstruction of Afghanistan once the conflict is over, and initial thinking on this issue is already under way in the United Nations.

Lastly, I would like to refer to the question of the posts which we have put in reserve and we would like to ensure that the conditions for the reserve are met before the posts are released - including the fact that the Commission has the capacity to use the posts during the next year in terms of the vacancies.
There is, however, one more very critical point, and I turn again to the Council of Ministers here.
Rumour has it, Mr President, that the early retirement package which is being negotiated in the Council at the moment is not open to Parliament.
I would like you to confirm in any future remarks that it will be open to us - that is a critical point for our Group as we wish to see it applied across all institutions.
I conclude, Mr President, on a point for our institution.
Yesterday evening, the Bureau decided, in opposition to the resolution of Mr Harbour, to go against the idea of having a linear career structure - I quote paragraph 38 of the Resolution which we voted in this House last November - "urges Parliament's administration to introduce a linear career structure in parallel to the Commission allowing for easy interinstitutional transfer".
It is unacceptable that Parliament's Bureau seems to have gone totally AWOL and decided for itself: under pressure from Parliament's administration, Parliament's Bureau has chosen to ignore what this Parliament has voted for.
Therefore, you will have to answer three questions, and I end on this.
Why is the organisation and the function of Parliament so distinctive from the Commission as to require a different career structure?
Secondly, how can a career structure retaining four different categories meet the objectives of a linear career structure with progression on merit as strongly supported by Parliament?
And lastly, how can staff mobility between institutions be encouraged if Parliament and the Commission have different career structures?
The Bureau has to come and justify before this Parliament the decisions it has taken as they are not in line with our resolutions.
Mr President, I do not want to repeat things, so I will stick to just a handful of points - although James Elles has stolen some of the thunder from my speech with his last two points.
I congratulate the rapporteurs.
Their work is never easy.
This year they have done a particularly good job under difficult circumstances.
I welcome the President-in-Office's statement that at the next conciliation he hopes we can get an agreement with the Council.
I hope so too because on 20 July, at the last conciliation, we agreed virtually nothing.
There is no point in having conciliation meetings if that is the level we are going to reach.
Hopefully, in November we may get something more positive.
As for the situation regarding the margins, which the President-in-Office also mentioned, there will not be much of a margin left by the time we vote on Thursday.
One of the reasons for that is because, once again, we could not get into any discussions with the Council; we could not get any agreements with the Council.
I made the point on several occasions in July that the three institutions must seriously discuss the problems of trying to finance categories 3, 4 and 5 for the future.
The Council cannot ignore these categories as though there were no problems.
At times it seems it is like an ostrich with its head stuck in the sand trying to ignore all the problems around it.
When the Council takes that attitude, we are left talking to the backside, although sometimes we get more sense out of the backside of an ostrich than out of some of the people that we do have to speak to!
That is not a reference to you President-in-Office!
There are times when it is so frustrating trying to get the message through that we waste our time having conciliation meetings.
Hopefully, in November we will get something a lot more concrete.
On the issue of reform, James Elles has just touched on a very significant point.
I was going to refer to the concern that we have about the progress that is not being made, but Parliament has not helped itself with that decision last night by the Bureau.
One has to hope that can be changed rapidly.
Realistically, it is now left with the Council: almost three years have passed since the resignation of the Commission, and we still have not seen the reform that everyone is looking for.
The general public, the taxpayers of Europe, are looking for the reform which we promised almost three years ago.
Where are we?
It is stuck in the Council.
President-in-Office, you are aware, because I have discussed this issue with you, that the message must get through that we need a solution to this as quickly as possible.
Otherwise the whole process will be bogged down in the mire.
Hopefully, Parliament can play its part and unravel last night's decision and continue on the track of getting a speedy process going so we can get the whole issue sorted out, not just for the Commission but for all the institutions.
I want to turn to the Global Health Fund which we have a budget line and a relatively small amount of money for next year.
As we are all aware, the Commission will be bringing forward proposals to finance that from this year's budget, taking EUR 60 million from the general budget and EUR 60 million from the EDF.
I need to ask the Commission a question: on the monies from the EDF, once that budget is agreed, it is agreed with the ACP states, so can we be assured that the ACP states have agreed to the use of EUR 60 million for the Global Health Fund?
Several of my colleagues have asked me that question, and quite frankly, I do not know the answer to it.
So if Commissioner Schreyer could reply to that, I would be grateful.
Let me turn to the contentious issue of the A-30 lines.
It seems that whenever we vote on the A-30 lines, we please very few people and displease a lot of people.
I would hope that the situation that we found ourselves in this time will give us the courage for next year to make proposals which envisage a more transparent system.
We are concerned that if we hand the whole process over to the Commission, it will be no better.
The Commission will take the decisions instead of Parliament.
I hope we can get some sort of an agreement within Parliament on how we handle A-30 in the future.
Finally, I want to make a plea to the Council and to repeat what I said in conciliation and at the recent trialogue.
What we need is a working group of the Council and Parliament at a political level to start looking at value for money within the European Union, to look at the institutions, to look at the activities and to make sure that we can persuade the taxpayers that they really are getting value for money.
I hope you will take that on board.
Mr President, firstly my sincere thanks and congratulations go to Mr Costa Neves, Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Seppänen for their excellent work.
At the same time I wish to thank Terence Wynn, as chairman of the Committee on Budgets, who has proved a competent leader in the work of the current year.
The job of general rapporteur is a tough and demanding one, but Mr Costa Neves has managed well and my group supports his policy on the Commission' s budget.
The budget' s general lines include cancelling the cut in agricultural expenditure, attending to arrears in payments, and the Commission' s reform.
The strengthening of the policy on the northern dimension in the budget' s explanatory statement may also be regarded as a positive move.
The handling of the budget is based very much on last year' s financial statements, which showed a surplus of EUR 11 billion.
Expenditure was EUR 8.5 billion less than anticipated and EUR 6.5 billion of the Structural Funds remained unspent.
For that reason, we now have to pay special attention to improving administration and not producing such large estimates for expenditure.
Otherwise, the bottom will fall out of budget policy altogether.
One particular focus in the budget is the reduction in payment arrears.
At present they stand at more than EUR 60 billion.
My group supports this goal.
It also supports the reform of the Commission, which is one of Parliament' s most urgent priorities.
It will increase efficiency and the importance of personal responsibility.
It is being proposed that a part of the appropriations should be placed in a reserve, so that the Commission may quickly propose a reform of its staff regulations and clarify its ideas on the early retirement scheme.
Heading 4 is difficult.
The Commission and the Council are proposing EUR 125 million for the Moroccan fishing agreement, although this agreement is not forthcoming.
This is clearly a matter of a concealed reserve which, indeed, contravenes the Financial Regulation.
It must be dissolved.
As a counterweight, it is being proposed that a flexible instrument should be used to modernise the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets.
This could be partly acceptable.
On the other hand, our group cannot accept the cut of EUR 84 million in the CARDS Programme.
We, as liberals, like participating in joint agreements to carry through the budget in Parliament, but we cannot be party to this idea.
The CARDS Programme has been an undisputed priority with Parliament, and, for that reason, we are hoping for similar cuts in the budget for other programmes where payment appropriations have not been used to the extent they might have been in any case.
Of the small programmes, the most considerable is the A-30 appropriations, which are earmarked as assistance to organisations.
These appropriations take up a totally unreasonable amount of Parliament' s time in relation to their importance.
For that reason, the whole system should be clarified.
In addition, the way the organisations are selected is very rarely based on objective criteria.
We particularly support Mrs Buitenweg' s recommendations concerning discipline in Parliament' s budget, as mentioned in her report.
They remain beneath the ceiling we, ourselves, set, that is to say 20% of all administrative costs, even though it includes the costs relating to enlargement.
The question of eastward enlargement itself is one that must be dealt with in such a way that Parliament' s work is not made any harder and that in the future we may congregate in our own united assembly.
Mr President, I, too, would like again to express my thanks to the rapporteurs, and also to the Chairman of the Committee.
If you consider the conflicts that arose from attempts to pass budgets in the past few years, it seems as if greater calm prevails this year, as if the conflicts were not so evident to the public eye.
But it must be recorded that, this year too, the Council is not actually facing up to its responsibilities.
As a component part of the budgetary authority, it has the task of supporting a Budget with real commitment and in a politically explicable way.
Whilst Parliament worked very carefully for a balanced budget, in long debates, discussions and negotiations with most of the interested parties, weighing needs against the duty to budget prudently in the taxpayers' interests, the Council again merely cut lump sums without any underlying political thought.
At any rate, its political thinking is not clear to us, and the question arises of whether it ever engaged in any.
Problems are needlessly exacerbated by the way the Council acts, for, this year too, the Budget is below the margin, far under 1.27% of Gross Social Product, despite special tasks, preparations for enlargement and many other problems.
This year, the Council has cut payments by 10% across the board, something made all the more incomprehensible by the delay in implementing programmes in many areas.
Parliament is now reinstating these figures.
We cannot, on the one hand, build up expectations in areas such as the Structural Fund or overseas aid, but then live up to them only with great hesitation.
This undermines trust in the institutions of the EU.
So the Council must bear its share of responsibility for this if its action is to be approved.
This action is particularly problematic in Category IV, foreign policy.
Whilst the Foreign Ministers and Heads of Government make great speeches about the Common Foreign Policy, the Finance Ministers narrow-mindedly cut the supply of funds, without considering the prestige lost by the EU institutions.
It is far from clear why the instrument of a flexible reserve is not fully available to us this year.
We still have major problems in the Balkans, new tasks await us in Afghanistan and in its neighbouring states and more new tasks await us in the Middle East.
We need a response from the Council too on the way that the EU is losing its capacity for flexible reaction.
The Council must explain how the EU is to continue to be flexible and capable of political action.
We, as a group, are more critical of the A30 lines procedure.
The great number of individual motions - including those from Parliament - has led the two major groups to attempt a solution by dealing with them en bloc.
Our committee would then no longer be able to do any fine-tuning in this area, and we would thus be inadequately performing our monitoring function.
Now Mr Wynn has clearly mentioned that changes are to be made to the Budget process next year.
I hope we will be able to work together to produce an intelligently thought-out procedure which will also enable Parliament to perform its function of monitoring the A30 lines.
We must not lay ourselves open to the accusation that we are engaging in economics for the benefit of special interest groups.
This really is not what we should be doing in the Budget.
No, I do believe there must be a certain amount of self-criticism.
I am perfectly aware of the fact that there is a great deal of pressure on the time available to us, but every individual item in this field in particular must be politically justifiable even to people outside this Parliament.
I would like to sum up and end my speech by referring back to what previous speakers have said and, again, challenging Parliament to push ahead with its own reforms.
Our demands to the Council and the Commission for reform will only be credible if we strive credibly for reform ourselves.
Yesterday evening's decisions from the Chair did not, I believe, take sufficient account of that.
Mr President, a very strict budget policy has been adopted in the drafting of next year's budget.
As the GNP for the EU Member States has grown faster than the increase in payment appropriations, the amount the EU budget represents in the figure for combined GNP has shrunk to 1.03%.
That indicates that next year' s draft budget will not exhibit any special areas of focus.
The permitted ceiling in the EU budget is 1.27% of the combined GNP for the Member States.
There will consequently be room in the budget for areas of special focus, but the Council and the Commission do not seem to have the political will or the ability to prepare any such areas.
Examples of them might be employment or healthy food.
The EU political élite no longer even debates the matter of the prevention of unemployment, let alone try to combat it with appropriate policy.
Our group has traditionally stressed the importance of preventing unemployment.
In most cases unemployment is not the fault of the unemployed person him or herself: that person is at the mercy of the economic situation as it happens to be at any one time.
We must have a policy against unemployment.
The political élite and EU officials certainly look after their own interests.
We are to have an early retirement scheme that will generously reward those who no longer, even through retraining, can be made into functional tyres to go on EU wheels.
If there are hundreds of officials no longer needed, that shows just what a bad state EU staff policy is in.
The Commission' s ability to implement Parliament' s political decisions is nothing less than wretched.
The gap between the budget that has been decided and the budget implemented by the Commission is always much too wide.
There are no delays in payment when it comes to issues that are important to the Commission, whereas there often are in issues important to the Parliament.
The EU budget is a political document, as it channels money to the EU élite bodies, and now also to the European political parties and for EU propaganda.
That is not the way to make a citizen' s Europe.
If an illegal war was waged in the bombing of Yugoslavia, assistance for the country' s reconstruction should not be the object of cuts.
Let us hope that the CARDS vote does not take the large groups by surprise.
Mr President, we note that, for the first time, the Commission' s preliminary draft budget exceeds the symbolic EUR 100 billion mark and is firmly dominated by crisis spending on agriculture and external commitments.
In this first reading, our group supports many of the choices made by the rapporteur, such as the horizontal amendments, in principle, and particularly when this involves a systematic reduction of the RAL and the desire to prevent further RAL from building up.
As for agriculture, almost all of the appropriations for this sector have been restored, and this can only reassure our farmers, who are greatly in need of these funds.
The package of EUR 180 million approved by the Committee on Budgets in favour of other agricultural interventions also helps, even if we must condemn the obvious lack of appropriations for the emergency fund for veterinary complaints, for the distribution of agricultural products to the less wealthy sectors of the Community and for the setting up of young farmers.
With regard to cross-border regions, it is worthwhile reiterating that these regions already benefit from extensive financial support, and we might well consider whether, in view of their diversity, a unique instrument could be the appropriate response.
As far as internal policies are concerned, the interests of small- and medium-sized businesses are safeguarded, and Parliament can welcome the increase in appropriations that aim to combat violence against women and children, such as paedophilia and misuse of the Internet.
In our view, however, the reduction made by the Council concerning advertising for the euro, and which was increased by Parliament, is sufficient. This advertising, for which the citizens of our countries pay a high price, seems to be nothing more than propaganda.
Furthermore, the French delegation of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group is opposed to the appropriations included on a multitude of headings in Chapter A 30, which do nothing more than to encourage federalist presuppositions and these alone, whereas other tendencies are not recognised, in spite of the choice of the electorate.
With regard to Europol, and this thinking also applies to Eurojust, all our energies must of course be channelled into the fight against terrorism in all its guises, as reiterated by our Chairman, Charles Pasqua, who has relentlessly pursued this fight.
However, the necessary strengthening of solidarities and police and judicial cooperation between our nations would only serve as a pretext for the rampant communitarisation of policies and actions that fall fully within the remit of national sovereignty.
Furthermore, Europol is funded by national contributions, and, in our view, has no place in this budget.
As far as external actions are concerned, whilst our group appreciates that the appropriations in favour of the MEDA 2002 programme have been doubled, we condemn the drastic reductions in appropriations for the fishing agreement with Morocco. You cannot achieve good policies from figures alone and this decision by the Committee on Budgets is the worst message that we could send our counterparts in Morocco, particularly during this difficult time when there is an international crisis.
Lastly, Mr President, although we are able to welcome the method used by the rapporteur, we must admit that the excessive level of payment appropriations put forward by the Committee on Budgets will certainly not help to control public spending, as this would represent an additional cost of some FFR 27 billion, even for France alone.
Mr President, Commissioner, the budget must be the perfect instrument for choosing the EU' s political priorities.
And those choices, I should like to underline once more, must serve the interests of all European citizens.
The on-going debate on the final form to be taken by the Union indicates that there are many different opinions on the subject.
I am alarmed by the fact that this diversity of opinions is not reflected in many European projects.
The fact that a unilateral propaganda megaphone is resounding from Brussels across the Union, and at the citizen' s expense, concerns me greatly.
Those concerns were recently intensified when the Committee on Budgets rejected an amendment tabled by our Conservative English MEPs to inject impartiality into the Commission' s information policy.
There is more.
The Commission, as well as the majority in this Parliament, want to press on.
Driven by the intense desire to bring about political Union as soon as possible, the European Commission has submitted a proposal for making contributions to European political parties from community funding.
This is highly peculiar, for those European parties hardly exist.
The citizens are not familiar with them, yet we are expected to sponsor them.
Once again, the EU' s political diversity is being overlooked.
In this way, only mainstream European parties qualify for European subsidy, while the national political parties - which are closer to the citizen - do not.
Time and again, polls illustrate that the citizens in the Member States are not keen on interference from Brussels.
Promoting European political parties will only further alienate the citizen from European politics.
This is why we warmly recommend our amendment which proposes scrapping these contributions.
The Commission' s and Parliament' s urge to stress the distinctive features of the European political parties does not end at the Union' s borders.
I should like to quote one example by way of illustration. More than EUR 180 million is pledged annually to the Palestinian Authority.
If the schools paid from that budget use inflammatory school books full of racist and anti-Semitic language, the Commission washes its hands of the matter.
Why does the Commission continue to ignore this evil and keep running away from its political responsibility?
I have to say that the Union is punching above its weight.
The Union should confine itself to those areas of policy where European action has an obvious added value.
The fundamental choice which I, apart from all the positive things, miss in this budget, is that of prioritising the EU' s core tasks and leaving the other tasks where they belong: with the Member States.
Mr President, this Budget has again committed substantial sums of money to the planned enlargement.
We must not, though, in doing this, forget the 23 frontier regions which will be particularly - even adversely - affected by the accession of these countries.
Being a Member for one of these regions, Carinthia, I am disappointed.
I am sorry that the Commission, the Council, and also the Committee on Budgets are not giving these regions adequate support by allocating sufficient budget resources.
To cut resources for these regions is to play a dangerous game with popular feeling.
If the population of these regions suffers overwhelming disadvantages, as is to be feared, the possibility cannot be excluded that they will vote against enlargement and thereby jeopardise the whole undertaking.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if, today, we are discussing at first reading stage the Community budget for the coming year, we are of course talking about politics coated with figures.
A lot of the European Parliament's initiatives can be seen in that way.
We want to exert pressure on the Council - those who have spoken before me have pointed out how urgently that is needed - but also on the Commission, because many points have not yet been given the consideration they deserve.
I will push on with the subject on which Mr Ilgenfritz has just finished speaking, that is to say, the frontier regions.
It is just not the case that we have cut something, rather we are of course waiting, Commissioner for a rather feeble communication to be followed up by the presentation of something more from the Commission for the frontier regions, as the Commission has a monopoly on initiative.
You were perfectly well able to propose legal foundations for other things in quick order.
When it comes to the frontier regions, though, you cover yourself with modesty.
But it will not do for you to tell us that you observe Parliament's intentions with great interest.
The Commission is being called on to produce an initiative.
That is your duty - it is an honourable one - and you cannot evade responsibility for it.
So I hope that we will succeed, here in this Parliament on Thursday, in adopting the inclusion of EUR 10.8 million in the reserve for the PRINCE programme.
I think this will motivate the Commission to present a corresponding proposal on the frontier regions.
The same goes for the issue of the 317 new posts that the Commission has asked for.
I think it high time to synchronise the Budget procedure and the Commission's legislative process.
We cannot have the situation where we briefly discuss the annual reports on the legislation in preparation if the Budget has, in principle, already been passed.
Here, too, it is a matter of ensuring synchronisation of these two activities.
So it is right to keep these posts, and the resources for them, in reserve.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the same is true of the common foreign and security policy.
It is enough to make me weep when I hear your disquisitions on how we would be making savings here in an important area.
Please bear in mind that we have an interest in dealing with these things as part of the Community Budget, where, to a large degree, they rightly belong.
Correspondingly, of course, cuts must be made in the relevant Budget line.
The Council cannot get itself a savings tin for this and thus develop activities independently of the Commission and Parliament.
There are papers to this effect in the Council.
You may be sure that Parliament will not let that go through.
The same goes for Europol and Eurojust.
I do not propose to go into further detail about this.
I wish to extend heart-felt thanks to the rapporteurs, in particular to Carlos Costa Neves and of course Mrs Buitenweg as well, for making our work together so pleasant.
We got a bit further with the Parliamentary budget in terms of truth and clarity.
It makes little sense to put funds in reserve for the purposes of a law, and then end up spending it on buildings.
It is therefore more right and proper to put it straight in the Budget line for buildings where it will be used at year-end anyway.
We will, though, have to ensure - and this is a lesson from this year's Budget procedure - that all proposals for our Parliamentary budget are presented by the Bureau as early as May.
A procedure such as today's, with many important decisions being taken only in September and immediately before the discussions in the Committee on Budgets, is something we cannot accept.
I still have grave concerns about the state of health of our colleagues in the various institutions.
We had requested a report on sickness absence for this year.
Working in certain institutions is indeed very dangerous, as a lot of people in them are off sick.
We will have to get to grips with this and take steps to improve the health of our colleagues in the institutions in question.
In conclusion, I really would like to ask - and Terry Wynn has already mentioned this to great effect - that we should now make progress in November on the issue of cooperation, so that, in December, we can adopt a proper and orderly Budget for 2002.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would also like to start by thanking most sincerely the three rapporteurs, Mrs Buitenweg, Mr Costa Neves and Mr Seppänen, for the work they have put in.
Anyone who follows the process as intensively as the coordinators sometimes do, can see how much work is actually involved.
Hence my special and wholehearted thanks on behalf of all my group.
I am glad that the President-in-Office of the Council is still here, as I think every year's Budget process must bring with it the opportunity to point out one thing: this Budget process is not complete.
Its ability to contribute notwithstanding, this Parliament is not yet in full and complete possession of the power that citizens' Parliamentary representatives must have when the budget for the coming year is at issue.
I have hinted that I will say that over and over again.
I will do as Cato the Elder did to the ancient Romans - he was the one who wanted to see Carthage destroyed - but perhaps I will not go quite that far.
I desire only the destruction of an undemocratic process and I will always be reminding you of that.
This Budget process, even as regards the agricultural budget, is complete only when it has got us well and truly on board, and when we have complete responsibility for receipts and outgoings.
I know that I am not meeting with much resistance on your part, but of course we have to develop this further in discussion and argument.
Only then will the citizens of the European Union be able to decide by their votes whether we, this Parliament, have done well or not.
The Council and the Commission must of course have a part in this process in future.
We will accord them high honour for it.
I believe, though, that Parliament, being composed of elected representatives, is the primary partner in dialogue.
We will in future continue to point to the need for further developments here.
We are working on Budget matters in a very restricted framework, which itself is prescribed by the Financial Perspective, to which we adhere, even though we see that additional demands are made on us which were not recognisable as such at the time the Financial Perspective was adopted.
We must adapt to this and facilitate further developments within our Budget framework.
At present that is surely still possible, for we see from the backdraughts at the end of every year that there is still enough air.
So, either there is not proper implementation - a fault which will have to be tackled - or the items really were estimated too high.
Even there it is still possible to let some air out.
I will tell you though, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner, that we will in the foreseeable future - in other words by the expiry date of this Financial Perspective at the latest - have to talk about further developments.
When it comes to the further development of the Financial Perspective, we will have to do some thinking about much more intensive and definite ways of meeting new challenges.
Up until then, we will have been letting air out all over the place.
We will be back on the launch pad, and will have to discuss what appropriate terms for this House's budget and the Budget as a whole might look like.
We will be ready to energetically dispute over further developments with you.
On the road to this destination, we will give the Commission the support it needs when it comes to modernising its administrative procedures.
We will be at its disposal when needed staff are to be taken on.
But, on the contrary, we will also be making quite massive demands.
We will be demanding a great deal so that our programmes, which we cast in numerical form in the Budget, actually come into being in the course of the year.
No longer will we stand by and watch payment arrears being built up.
Progress is being made - I will admit that here and now.
I certainly would not claim that we are where we were two or three years ago.
But despite this progress, there is still a need for a massive amount of further work.
As I have said, we will support you, but we will also make demands.
In the area of individual Budget lines and categories, too, we will hold fast to that which has proved its worth.
The people who rely on us to give support when it is needed, will be able to rely on us in future too.
That starts in Category I, with the farmers who cannot change everything around from one day to another, but need a certain headstart.
These people must also know that there is to be a change in this European Union.
We, as a Parliament, will help to bring it about.
In future, we will take an intensive look at Category I and bring in modernisation.
We will introduce innovation.
If there is no discernible development in these areas, which are in Category VII rather than Category I, but still affect agriculture, if SAPARD is not implemented, we will ask you to take the innovative resources that made LEADER such a success and transpose them so as to provide rapid short-term help.
We will bring this in, and we will also take care that all the security for farmers will not prevent the consumers, too, being certain that produce will be safe for them and not injurious to their health.
At first reading, we will vote to add the necessary resources to the reserve, resources that formerly seemed to be needed in order to properly treat BSE and foot-and-mouth disease.
We are aware that these diseases have recently appeared among sheep and elsewhere.
I do not know whether appropriate steps will be taken on this front.
We will act accordingly in the first instance, until the letter of amendment has been presented and we have an overall view of things.
We will make it our concern to meet and overcome the two great challenges presented in Category II.
The reconstruction of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets is crucial and of the utmost importance.
People there have relied on being able to pursue their livelihood subject to certain restrictions.
The failure of the Morocco Agreement means that will no longer be possible.
I am now addressing both the Commission and the Council when I say that we found that provision of these EUR 125 million, even though it was clear at the beginning of this year that the money could not be used, hardly a serious way of doing things.
Despite this - or indeed because of it - the fishermen have a claim on help from us, and we will ensure in the Budget process that appropriate action is taken.
The same applies to the frontier regions, which are not always rich and able to help themselves.
I think, for example, of Bavaria; regions like that are a bit better off.
There are other regions which really need more aid, with which we will be concerned.
What we will be developing in Category III will be oriented towards the future.
Developments following 11 September have shown us that developments are needed in this area.
Europol and Eurojust must be developed further, and national sensitivities must be overcome.
If terrorism is to be combated, all its advantages in the game must be done away with.
We must not stand on old rights.
There is room for progress here.
What we want is to continue with what was begun last year, that is to say, the inclusion of people in society by means of access to the labour market.
We must not simply forget this a year on from it having been a crucial point in Mrs Haug's Budget report, now that new problems are in the offing.
People also have a right to social inclusion through training in modern information and communications technologies.
This applies not only to cultivated and highly educated people, but also to those who perform very simple work.
Thank you very much for your attention.
I again thank the rapporteurs and hope that, in cooperation with the other two institutions, we will be able to bring this process to a successful conclusion.
(Applause)
Mr President, I too should like to start by thanking the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Costa Neves.
It is, in my experience, the first time that the rapporteur has not tampered with the financial perspectives.
I welcome this, especially since we have ended up with a budget surplus of some EUR 11 billion.
I should like to make some observations concerning the different headings.
I will start with the first heading. I am in favour of the reserve for foot-and-mouth disease.
I do not know what other disasters could be heading in our direction, but I believe that the end is not yet in sight.
I repeat once again, but I have said it so often: in my opinion, the Commission should not stop thinking about possible alternative ways of funding the fight against crises of this type.
We can look into insurance systems.
We can put all kinds of restrictions in place, but I do not think that we can rely on the fact that, in the years to come, there will be an annual surplus of one to two billion in the agricultural budget.
I should particularly like to recommend the amendments on further foot and mouth research, tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to the Council of Ministers.
Can we develop marker vaccines, or new testing methods?
Can we examine whether a vaccinated animal is still infectious?
With regard to heading 2, I endorse the gist of the rapporteur' s policy designed to achieve an improved expenditure and commitment policy.
I am thus in favour of the amendments which he has tabled in this connection, with only one exception: the increase in payment appropriations is rather extreme in my opinion.
Along with the Commission, I fail to see how this can be spent in a reasonable manner.
Consequently, I will in this connection vote differently from the way in which many of you will probably vote.
Concerning the proposals to use the flexibility instrument in order to restructure the fishing fleet in Spain and Portugal, I am anxiously awaiting the Commission' s proposals.
On a final note, I think we ought to bolster Eastern Europe.
The SAPARD payment periods must be extended to 2003.
The fact that the payment bodies have not yet been approved should not put those countries at a disadvantage.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my capacity as Chairman of the EP delegation for relations with Central Asia, I shall confine myself to a few comments concerning those budget lines.
What are they about?
In the first instance, they are about aid to the partner countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
Central Asia is an unstable region and has, since the outbreak of the war in Afghanistan, really been at the epicentre of world politics.
We all know that military action on its own will not bring a sustainable solution in the region and that we will need to invest in democratic institutions, in a civil society, in socio-economic and ecological reforms, in the fight against drugs and poverty and in sound education.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that is the key aim of our efforts in Central Asia.
Hence our call to increase that budget line by 5% for commitment appropriations and by 20% for payment appropriations.
Secondly, I should like to ask you to give your attention to the aid for victims of radiation, particularly in the Semipalatinsk region in Kazakhstan.
In that region, the Soviet army carried out 607 nuclear arms tests between 1949 and 1999, the bulk of which were above-ground.
The Soviets obliged the population to come out of their houses and watch the huge nuclear mushroom.
The effects are catastrophic: the incidence of cancer is five times higher than the national average, birth defects are three times more common than the national average, many young men are impotent and twelve-year old girls suffer from breast cancer.
Psychological disorders and suicide are very common, and the average life expectancy is around 52.
That is the reason why, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we would like to increase the payment appropriations in budget line B7-524 from EUR 45 million to 60 million.
Mr Vande Lanotte, you are visiting our House and attending the sitting. You said you have come to listen, rather than make any comments, and I can understand that.
However, I should nevertheless like to draw your devoted and kind attention to these two important amendments and maybe, upon completion of this 2002 budgetary procedure, we could visit Semipalatinsk together to witness the disastrous effects of the nuclear insanity and to see how European money could be spent in a effective and useful manner.
I would be much obliged.
Mr President, the proposals for 2002 confirm the trend of recent years to reduce the relative value of the Community budget, as can be clearly seen from the fact that the proposed amount is the lowest in the last decade; only 1.03% of GDP.
Because of the restrictive guidelines of the Stability Pact and also because of the problems resulting from a major economic slowdown, the Council is continuing to suggest cuts, which creates real problems for the budget' s implementation.
This year' s procedure once again betrays true budgetary chaos, with new needs arising and the number of priorities increasing and appropriations becoming smaller and smaller, leading to cutbacks that can only be overridden by revising the Financial Perspective, which is what we have always advocated.
Hence, by subscribing to the Council' s way of thinking, the European Parliament is doing no more than vainly attempting to disguise these needs, which are undeniable.
This also clearly highlights the absence of clear priorities and a coherent strategy for guaranteeing the proper funding of Community policies in various fields, specifically those of cooperation, agriculture and employment.
This is a concern that increases yet further with the creation of considerable reserves which, in the current context, can only give rise to greater doubts.
With regard to category four, the only chapter of the budget that continues to show a consistent reduction in sums, the lack of appropriations is striking, particularly if we take account of the needs of and the commitments given to the Balkans, to Palestine, to Afghanistan, on the World Health Fund or for the conversion of the fleets operating in Moroccan waters.
The rapporteur' s idea, which is not new, seeks to cut spending, particularly on the Balkans, in order to be able to increase the remaining aid for cooperation and to force the Council to negotiate.
Let us hope that this does not lead to further cuts in cooperation such as those we saw last year.
We shall see in December what happens.
These are some of the reasons why we do not support this budget.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur as well as the rapporteur for the other institutions.
I think that they have both done an excellent job.
They presented a proposal to the House that is, on the whole, acceptable and which, in any case, the radical Members will support.
I would also like to highlight the participation of the President-in-Office of the Council in the overall debate, to thank him for taking part and who demonstrates a willingness for dialogue.
I hope that his participation will bear fruit at second reading and even that, looking beyond the budget, it will have a positive effect on other very important budgetary issues, particularly the financial regulation.
I would simply like to make two comments on the rapporteur' s overall strategy.
The first comment concerns the RAL.
I fully support the strategy used to attempt to reduce their levels, which are becoming rather unmanageable, and to send a clear message to the Commission for its help in trying to do this.
I ask myself, and I ask the rapporteur, the following question: how do you know it is right to apply this strategy to a very specific situation, that of Afghanistan?
The RAL are obviously related to the issue of providing aid to refugees, of providing humanitarian aid.
I therefore wonder whether or not this could be the time, perhaps - and I put this to the rapporteur, although I understand that it may be difficult at this late stage - to put money - and, in doing so, send out a political message - in the reserve for Afghan refugees.
Of course, this should be part of an overall strategy, which is perfectly justified, but I wonder whether or not, for this specific message, we could possibly change the strategy, in any case, at second reading.
My second comment concerns the reform of the Commission.
I strongly deny what James Elles said.
Furthermore, I believe that yesterday' s Bureau meeting and the Conference of Presidents unanimously supported the proposals from the parliamentary group responsible for this dossier.
I reiterate that this group suggested - or indicated in any case - to the Commission, and in particular to the Vice-President charged with reform, that the path that the Commission recommended was not the correct path and was not the path that Parliament advised.
Furthermore, given the misunderstandings regarding the number of non-assigned posts, I even question whether the previous system, with one commissioner responsible for both budget and staff, was not the best approach, insofar as the overall picture can be seen.
I therefore reiterate that Parliament supports the proposal that runs counter to the proposal outlined by the Vice-President, Mr Kinnock.
Mr President, on behalf of my group and on my own behalf, I would like to thank the general rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, and the other two rapporteurs, Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Seppänen.
From a budgetary point of view, by 2002, the rhythm of implementation of appropriations must have reached cruising speed: there is no overlapping with the previous programming period and there can be no delay in the implementation of programmes.
It is a year in which the forecasts contained in the financial perspectives can be fully achieved.
In order for the two powers responsible for implementation (the Commission and the Member States) to achieve this fully, the rapporteur offers us a strategy for reducing the backlog; in order to support his strategy, he uses the performance targets identified by the Commission at the request of an initiative presented by the European Peoples' Party for the 2001 Budget.
It is important that this House accepts the Costa Neves strategy in the field of payment appropriations.
Without decisive action by the European Parliament, it is going to be difficult to achieve an interinstitutional political commitment on improving the quality of expenditure, which has always been our priority.
We also support the strategy of the general rapporteur in relation to the new demands, the Commission' s letter of amendment, where it refers to the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument in order to finance the new structural needs, the restructuring of the Spanish and Portuguese fleets which fished in Moroccan waters, which is awaiting the proposed funding the Commission has promised but has still not presented.
The rapporteur has also presented both pro memoria in the budget lines for that restructuring, and also in relation to a programme for increasing the competitiveness of the border regions with a view to the enlargement of the Union.
Let us hope that between the first and second readings, the Commission will clarify the situation of this programme and the possible funding proposals.
Furthermore, we have the insoluble problem of the lack of financial resources in Category 4 for external action.
This problem threatens to tarnish budgetary procedure after budgetary procedure.
The Union takes on more and more external commitments, often without consulting this House.
Later, unilateral cuts are decided on in the traditional external action lines under the pretext of deficient implementation, responsibility for which is always attributed to external factors and never to the functioning of the Commission or the Member States themselves.
Parliament must therefore, year after year, become embroiled in a pointless fight to remove the cuts which both the Commission, in its preliminary draft, and the Council, in its first reading, carry out.
This prejudices the role which must be played by such important committees as Foreign Affairs, Development and the Committee on Budgets itself.
A very good example this year is the EUR 125 million for the never-signed fishing agreement with Morocco.
It has never been explained why the Commission included these appropriations in the reserve, but the true consequence is that the rapporteur has had to employ (and the political groups support him) a strategy of cuts in order to achieve the mobilisation of these fishing appropriations which were never used.
Honest interinstitutional cooperation must be based on recognition of the budgetary prerogatives of each of the institutions.
To wait for the November conciliation to resolve fundamental issues weakens the role of the parliamentary negotiation and the role of the tripartite dialogues for the whole year.
We in the European Peoples' Party consider essential to the good operation of the budgetary procedure, amongst other things, the harmonisation of legislative and budgetary procedures, the genuine participation of the European Parliament in the creation of the rules of the game, that is, the Financial Regulation, prior knowledge of the Commission' s working programme, more active involvement by Parliament in the budgetary element of the Commission reform, etc.
All these aspirations are contained in our amendments, which we will put to the vote on Thursday, and which we hope will receive majority support.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like many others, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves.
The cooperation has been really good. As 'shadow rapporteur' for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I have also encountered a very constructive attitude, and that is something for which I am grateful.
By this time, almost all practical proposals from Parliament have been dealt with, and I must therefore concentrate on a number of more theoretical points of view.
The budget is the ultimate expression of democracy and social development.
It is through the budget that we decide that our public institution needs to use tax revenue in order in some way to influence society, and it is the EU' s budget that is relevant when it comes to transnational European issues.
It is always difficult to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the desire to do important things and, on the other, the need to respect budget discipline and to ensure that taxpayers genuinely get value for money.
In the EU, this balancing act is unusually complicated due to the fact that it has to be carried out both by two budget authorities in tandem and by each authority in its own right.
In the case of the Council, it even has to be performed within each and every one of the fifteen governments.
Unfortunately, the problem is often that, with one voice - for example that of the agricultural and foreign ministers - the Council pledges a whole lot of money to, for example, agriculture and the fight against BSE and foot and mouth, to the transformation of poor regions, to fishing fleets, to the Balkans and to Afghan refugees etc, while, with its other voice - that of the finance ministers - it says no to increased expenditure.
The problem is not made any easier by the fact that those who promise aid do not so often ensure that the Commission, which is to implement all these measures, has the resources needed to turn the promises into a reality.
There are often considerable commitments made, but the level of implementation is low and the funding insufficient.
In spite of this criticism, I believe that, for the most part, taxpayers get value for money.
I am an MEP for Sweden, the EU' s most Eurosceptic country and, at the same time, the country in which the individual taxpayer contributes most money to the EU.
This situation means that it is not always so easy to persuade people to believe that the money is in actual fact used well.
The myth of the EU as a hopeless colossus is so strong that I am scarcely believed at home when I say that, even for Sweden, the net cost of the EU amounts to only 1 per cent of the State budget, that the budget is not increasing in real terms and that it is implemented in such a way that the Swedish exchequer gets back a large part of its contribution each year.
Indeed, a tenth of the whole budget is in practice paid back to the Member States.
I believe, as I say, that we get value for money, but there are still a lot of shortcomings.
We need to do quite a lot in the future in order to convince people that the funds are being properly used.
First of all, I believe that we must simplify the budget procedure itself and ensure that it is made more transparent.
The new budget regulation and activity-based budgeting should contribute to this.
Secondly, we must speed up internal reform.
We have certainly now placed a number of services in the reserve, but the aim of this is not to slow down, but to force the pace of, reform.
I am also convinced that, as Commissioner Schreyer pointed out in his speech, we are going to have to make the budget more flexible and increase our ability to respond to new events.
In order to achieve this, I also believe that a new spirit of cooperation is needed between the two branches of the budgetary authority.
Most obvious, perhaps, are the deficiencies in category 4, that of external expenditure, to which the Council has added new expenditure year after year on, for example, aid to Kosovo and Serbia, new fisheries agreements etc. This year, we have had far-reaching discussions on assistance to refugees, the Global Health Fund and other efforts to combat AIDS etc.
In both 2000 and 2001, we solved this problem by means of the flexibility instrument, which gave us a further EUR 200 million per year.
The problem this year is that the programmes for Kosovo and Serbia which necessarily gave rise to this flexibility instrument must still be implemented at a high level but without our being able this year to use the flexibility instrument' s EUR 200 million.
In spite of this, the Council will prevent us from using those funds that are not needed for the fisheries agreements, and that is something I do not understand.
Why are we not allowed to use them when we, in actual fact, have major costs for the programmes to which we have agreed?
This does not hold water.
With this policy, the Council is forcing us to do something I should preferably have liked us to avoid, namely to say no to a proportion of the major expenditure on the Balkans, even if we are obviously using this to protect the most sensitive areas, that is to say Serbia and Kosovo.
Let us conduct an open dialogue in this area, characterised by trust.
We understand the Council' s priorities when it comes to the Balkans, AIDS etc, but then we should also ask for a certain amount of understanding for the fact that we cannot prioritise away all the issues closest to our hearts.
We want to rescue aid to the Balkans.
Let us get around the negotiating table.
Mr President, the 2002 EU Budget, amounting to EUR 51 billion, appears at first sight to be balanced and straightforward.
The increase of 5% over the outgoings of the Budget year 2001 corresponds to the Berlin agricultural guidelines.
That is not only good but also inevitable, as no other policy is as thoroughly submitted to Community methods as agricultural policy.
I note with particular concern, however, that this great chunk of agricultural expenditure is increasingly the object of covetous desires on the part of not a few politicians who see it as a sort of disposable object which can be moved around at will.
If this intention is to be countered, the Financial Perspective will have to be qualified by the Commission, any kind of speculation eliminated and the across-the-board cuts that are always being sought in the agricultural budget not in fact implemented.
The appearance of foot-and-mouth disease eleven months ago has meant a very unbalanced situation in animal husbandry, especially as regards food safety, animal protection and the internal market.
Distorted competition in markets leads to the loss of jobs and income.
Pricing is becoming chaotic and nobody can explain why.
So I wish to advocate a temporary increase in the financial allocation to the market organisation for animal husbandry.
I urge that the so-called interim balance sheet of Agenda 2000 should not be put off simply to do a favour for a particular country.
I urge moreover that the reserve should be kept until an explanation is given of the contradiction by which we were talking about EUR 1 billion last year and only EUR 400 million now.
Mr President, at the first reading of the 2002 budget, we would like to express our reservations about a number of amendments tabled by the European Parliament and which put increasing pressure on spending in order to meet, as explained in the motion for a resolution - and I quote 'the legitimate expectations of citizens, regions and governments of the European Union' .
Go on, blame the citizens!
In the few minutes' speaking time that I have, I will give one example; that of the B3-500 budget line, to which the European Parliament would like to allocate EUR 7 million in order to fund the so-called European political parties.
This appropriation is without legal basis and has no moral justification.
Of course, the citizens have never given their opinion on this, but if we asked them if they want to pay more taxes to fund political parties in Brussels, they would obviously say no.
On the other hand, the MEPs would say yes, as this is of great interest to them.
These European political parties are inter-party organisations that have no militant base to speak of. Their funding - provided thus far by the parliamentary groups of this House out of their administrative appropriations - has been the subject of a recent report published by the Court of Auditors.
Because of this, the so-called European parties are seeking other sources of funding.
And since the citizens do not seem to want to pay of their own accord, we are going to make them pay by means of tax and social security deductions, so that they have no choice.
For reasons that I have already explained during our debate on the Schleicher report on 17 May 2001, and in my explanation of vote given on the same day, the B3-500 budget line has no legal basis, no more than the draft regulation on the status and funding of European political parties. The Council has still not reached agreement on this regulation.
Admittedly, the Treaty of Nice provides the possibility of a legal basis by adding a second sub-paragraph to Article 191 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, but there is no need to remind you - especially in the wake of the negative outcome of the Irish referendum - that there is still a long way to go before this Treaty can be ratified.
Lastly, the draft regulation without legal basis and currently being examined by the Council aims to put in place an underhand funding system that runs counter to freedoms.
To cap everything, the chairs of the five European parties have recently written to Council and to the Commission to demand that the funding from Europe is increased to EUR 15 million instead of EUR 7 million.
Such is inflation!
We believe that the political parties in Europe must be freely financed by citizens and by the national political parties, who are themselves funded according to national regulations in line with their respective legal system and constitution.
That is why, Mr President, the MEPs of the Mouvement pour la France group, along with the Members of the SOS Démocratie group, will vote against the B3-500 budget line.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Budget process has many problems which we know of old, and new challenges which we cannot yet, in the course of this first reading, conclusively evaluate and deal with.
I wish at this point to return explicitly to something about which there are some rather vague conceptions in this House, namely that, since 1992, there has been a fundamental change in the common agricultural policy.
Commissioner, in announcing a letter of amendment, you reminded me that this is the same procedure as every year, with, first, the spectre of a budgetary crisis being conjured up, and then the discovery of room for manoeuvre in the agriculture budget.
At this point, I say an emphatic 'Yes' to a contingency reserve, but when there really is a crisis, this reserve must actually be used, for many sectors currently find themselves fighting for their very existence.
I would very much like to take up the debate on the eastward enlargement, in order to make one thing clear: I have no problem whatever with the full integration of the acceding countries' agriculture into the Common Market by 2004, if at the same time the free movement of persons, capital, services and goods, which is part of full membership, is also made a reality, so that there can at last be a fair debate on the whole context of this topic.
The conclusions of the Heads of State and of Government at Nice have, on the one hand, highlighted the need to start restructuring the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets.
I support this, but would point out at the same time that we cannot, on the other hand, let a very restrictive approach in the next two years keep the remaining European fishing fleets at arms length and wasting away.
We must have discussions with the Commission about this.
Let me say quite explicitly that the 25 July communication from the Commission on the frontier regions was held by Parliament, in its resolution of 5 September, not to comply with the requirements laid down by the European Council.
For that reason, Commissioner, we call upon the Commission to produce definite proposals for a regulation on the frontier regions.
Let me now address one further point.
We made 400 posts available in the 2001 Budget.
We are now talking in terms of 317, which are still being kept in reserve.
Commissioner, please just take a look at the posts in the Commission which have not yet been filled.
I will remind you, in addition to the points we have mentioned in connection with the release of the reserve, that we spent last year reiterating that reform includes the simplification of the acquis communautaire, without the Community patrimony being substantially affected thereby.
There is, in my judgment, a need for further negotiation on this point.
One final point, Mr President: We expect, before the second reading, to have a comprehensive report by the Commission on the re-examination of the fundamental concepts of foreign policy, so that we have, with reference to current demands, a conclusive plan for combining conflict prevention, decisive humanitarian aid and the alliance against terrorism in a rational Community package, which we will be able to adopt at second reading.
Mr President, I will start by focusing primarily on the Seppänen report.
This is a comprehensive report which addresses all the problems of the final stage of the ECSC' s life, but it also takes into account the problems of the future, if it is true - which it is - that, although the ECSC is dying, the coal and steel industry must continue to develop in Europe.
The sum set aside for the ten remaining months of the ECSC budget is sufficient, and the increased appropriations for research are in line with the forecasts for after the Treaty' s expiry.
Parliament wants to play a leading part in our endeavours to give a reassuring response to the 357 000 workers who are employed in the sector and to provide a secure future in terms of the growth and restructuring of the sector.
I would now like to focus, in the last part of my speech, on the Union' s general budget.
As the members of my group have already said, starting with the coordinator, Mr Ralf Walter, our opinion of the work carried out by Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg is positive.
There are many elements which deserve a mention here: the undertaking to improve the quality and speed of expenditure, and here I refer to the Structural Funds, which require an extraordinary measure from the European institutions to motivate, coordinate and carry out prospective and retrospective assessments so that European federalism does not fail this major test; the attention given to the issue of border regions, mentioned by Commissioner Schreyer - I, too, agree with Mr Böge when he says that it is right to clarify the concept of a border region - not least in relation to the enlargement process: regions which must not be the only ones to benefit, Commissioner, and I would stress this point, for the pilot project approved last year does not and must not, as it progresses, just concern the border regions.

We have got off to a good start: the negotiations will take place and I feel that, ultimately, we will achieve a sound budget, but when I think of this great asset which is Europe, an asset which is ours and ours alone, a supranational political entity which others look to for guidance, as they will have to in the face of fresh challenges, I wonder whether we really ought not to review the financial mechanisms of the European budget if we want to consolidate a great supranational institution which is the envy of all and which needs more resources and a role that is more clearly defined.
Mr President, the 2002 budget for the European Union mirrors its anti-grass roots and arbitrary policy.
It is a budget for managing interests which presents no central objectives for resolving the problems being created by the recession, not even as a propaganda exercise.
The draft budget makes no serious or fundamental attempt whatsoever to redistribute income to the less developed areas or to the working classes hit by unemployment, underemployment and poverty.
The austerity imposed on the Member States and the European Union as a whole means that even the budget lines available in the past have been cut back.
Agricultural spending is being constantly eroded, with tragic consequences for farmers, in a bid to make national budgets pay for the anti-farming policy decided in Brussels.
On the contrary, following the terrorist attack on 11 September, the European Union is being called on to fund intergovernmental cooperation in the so-called area of justice, that is, to keep files on and prosecute citizens who go beyond the bounds of resistance and reaction tolerated by the system.
Finally, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will vote against the budget because, instead of resolving the current problems, it will create new problems for workers, farmers and small enterprises, instead of contributing towards peace in the world, it promotes war and an imperialist hegemony, instead of protecting individual and collective democratic, political workers' rights, it suppresses them.
Mr President, allow me to begin by thanking Mr Costa Neves for his very good work on next year' s budget.
It is with satisfaction that I at least observe that, for the first time in quite a few years, there has been no serious talk about revising the budget ceiling.
That is, for me, the sign of a rapporteur who, in a real sense, chooses to respect and apply the budget as a ceiling of expenditure and not as a target for expenditure.
That is something I think bodes well for forthcoming negotiations.
In spite of this, there is nonetheless good cause for warning against an unduly expansive budget, especially when it comes to categories 3 and 4. The limited margin in both these categories is cause for concern, especially when, in the wake of the terrorist attacks on 11 September, we see an approaching need for measures of humanitarian aid for Afghanistan, as well as a need for measures in the area of justice and home affairs.
The European Union is already expensive for taxpayers. I believe it to be obvious that we must ensure that it does not become still more expensive.
I see it as self-evident that, at this stage, Parliament should create room for negotiation in relation to the Council.
There is, however, reason for calling for a general tightening-up, on the parts of both the Council and Parliament, before the second reading so that, from a purely budgetary point of view, they are able to handle the situation that has arisen in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the United States.
Finally, just a few brief words about Mrs Buitenweg' s report.
The rapporteur has made progress in the preparatory work before enlargement in 2004.
That is good, and there is cause to thank her for this.
I must however note that a very great deal remains to be done in order to prepare and adapt the administration before an enlargement that will soon be only two years ahead of us.
Mr President, at this stage in the litany of speakers, I feel I should focus on and scrutinise a couple of items in the budget.
I will firstly mention an issue which I had not included in my notes: the Council is pleased that Parliament shares its concern about the backlogs, the RALs.
If I had not lived through 17 European budgets, I would be amazed.
In fact, it is the governments who have the greatest responsibility for the creation of RALs and the Council could make a more useful contribution to the reduction of the RALs by renouncing the systematic underbudgeting of payment appropriations, which do most damage to the pockets of the Finance Ministers.
What really concerns me most in this budget, however, is that, in real terms, in euros, aid to third countries has decreased since 1999.
If one thing became clear after 11 September it was precisely that it is going to be necessary to maintain and develop humanitarian aid and our contribution to development aid.
And this is in no way guaranteed by the Community budget, despite the efforts of the rapporteur, and I salute those efforts.
The financial perspectives are clearly not sufficient and we have a TV-addicted Council of Ministers, that is to say that their external priorities are led by the latest TV headlines.
We have Kosovo: we have to help Kosovo.
We have Serbia: we have to help Serbia.
We have Afghanistan: we have to help Afghanistan.
And the next headline will become the priority.
And what price do we pay?
The price of having to make cuts in previous policies.
We still have problems in the Balkans.
We still have a serious problem in Africa.
We still have problems of underdevelopment in Latin America and Asia.
But we have to make cuts.
The other question I wanted to raise, which is related to the last point, is whether there are first- and second-class European Councils.
Why is Berlin more important than Nice, in terms of expenditure?
Why?
In Berlin, financial perspectives were set which had to be agreed with Parliament, but in Nice, the same European Council, composed of almost the same people, said that we had to create a special programme for the restructuring of the fleet that fished in Morocco.
Why is that not budgeted for?
Why has the Council, with a Commission proposal valued at EUR 197 million, not budgeted for it?
It should have done so.
And I regret that Parliament has not fulfilled its obligation, because what we have to do on first reading is budget in the way we want.
The Council will then come in at the negotiation at second reading.
I regret that we have not been able to do this, but I trust that we will be able to resolve it between now and December.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to reiterate that I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, and not on behalf of my political group, and that, consequently, I would like to know exactly what has happened and why I was not included on the list of draftsmen.
I apologise if I have made a mistake, but if not, I would like to receive an official explanation.
Having made my point, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank the Members of the Committee on Budgets and particularly the general rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, for the attention he has given to the requests and concerns of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights.
We asked a great deal, Mr President, and we received a great deal in return, and this is something I welcome.
We only made legitimate requests.
We asked for an increase in the funding granted to the European Refugee Fund, and this was given.
We asked for an increase in the resources for measures to combat violence towards women, children and teenagers, and this was given.
We asked for an increase in the resources to combat child pornography on the Internet, and this was granted.
We asked for no less than six new budget lines, and these were given. We have a new European Migration Monitoring Observatory to enable the European Union to anticipate the arrival of waves of migrants and to be better prepared for these.
We have a specific research and evaluation programme on respect for fundamental rights of the European Union, so that the Charter of Fundamental Rights becomes an operational reality and not just a reality in words alone.
We have a new budget line that should enable Eurojust to become operational.
We have funding for the Schengen line with a view to adapting the Schengen Information System to the realities of enlargement, and, lastly, we anticipated - and this, Mr President, is an urgent request to the President-in-Office of the Council - we anticipated, given the current situation, exceptional appropriations for use by Europol in the fight against terrorism.
We are well aware of the limits of Europol' s actions, we also know that it is founded on conventions, and thus we could experience legal difficulties in using these appropriations.
However, we would like to address a formal appeal to the Council not to allow these appropriations to escheat, to create the legal basis, which will enable Europol to become fully operational and will allow Eurojust to develop to its full potential.
Thank you very much, Mr Deprez.
You did not appear on the list on behalf of the committee.
We will try to give you an answer when we can.
Mr President, I am going to follow Mr Colom i Naval' s advice by speaking on the problem of reform, for which I am the permanent rapporteur.
This problem is quite fundamental, because we have to reiterate on a regular basis that the European Parliament is firmly in favour of administrative reform of the institutions.
The polemics that are currently raging between those with differing views should be less important than the fundamental problems, and the fundamental problem is to make the Union' s action clearer and more effective in meeting the public' s expectations, so that citizens start to trust the European Union again.
You know that, in this budget, we noted several delays in implementing this reform, particularly as regards the Commission' s response - which we have yet to receive - on the rewriting of the financial regulation, and also with regard to setting up base management.
The report's fundamental concern is with the reform of the status and organisation of a career in European civil service.
We had to take a precautionary measure and put funds into the reserve for creating the new positions that were requested.
This is nothing more than a precautionary measure, and I would like to reiterate that, for the time being, this is only at the first reading stage as we asked the Commission to provide clarification on the implementation of the single Statute, so that we could have very precise and realistic answers, particularly on the problem of early retirement schemes for civil servants and temporary staff, but also on the problems caused by absenteeism and vacancies.
We believe that the Commission will be able to provide us with the answers to all these issues, but, nevertheless, I wanted to draw your attention to the fact that hypothetical positions will not help this reform to move forward.
We have 15 countries and seven institutions, but we have only one European Union, for which only one statute is needed.
We must not take refuge behind the reports published last year, because the linearity is no longer what it was.
We therefore want a clear budgetary framework in order to adopt a position, and I shall repeat the request made by all the Committees of Parliament to the Council: the Council must start talking and give us answers on a regular basis so that all our procedures - and reform, in particular - progress within a framework that is efficient in terms of budget.
This reform is vital: it must not just look good on paper, but should also be realistic and applicable over time.
Nothing will stop when we reach 2004. Everything must continue.
The reform process must provide renewed motivation and must modernise the way we work, but it must retain a European civil service that has one objective: to implement the political plans of the European Union that restore citizens' confidence.
Mr President, Mrs Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market devoted a great deal of attention to market integration in connection with the eastward enlargement.
The effects that will be manifested by this integration must also be taken into account when planning the Budget.
We see, looking at the Four Freedoms, that there will be no difficulties in some areas, but problems with adaptation in others.
There will be no great changes to the movement of goods, because substantial liberalisation has occurred, nor in freedom of establishment, because the person or business is subject to the laws of the state in which they establish themselves.
We will, though, have problems with integration as regards the free movement of labour and the freedom to provide services, for the precise reason that there has been to date no competition in these areas, and these markets are only regionally oriented unless they choose to be otherwise.
The frontier regions will therefore come under particular pressure when the freedoms in question are introduced.
Specific aid measures are therefore needed.
The recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market make it clear that it advocates endowing the frontier regions programme that you, Commissioner, mentioned, with additional resources.
We are grateful to the Committee on Budgets and especially to the rapporteur for their accepting these suggestions and, in part, adding to them.
One point in particular is of importance to me: the instruments proposed by the Commission are not sufficient to strengthen competitiveness in the frontier regions, as they promote only cooperation between East and West rather than the specific situation of the frontier regions themselves.
A specific programme is therefore needed, and so we request the Commission to present a legal foundation for it; I take their statements to mean that they are prepared to do this.
Mr President, to begin with, I should like to protest against the fact that the offices did not actually consider our opinion as such, for the reason that it mainly consists of amendments.
They apparently considered our opinion as individual amendments tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
I hope that this kind of procedure will run more transparently in future.
With regard to the budget, thanks partly to a tremendous effort by our rapporteur, this has become a budget of consolidation.
There are, of course, always disagreements about all kinds of sections of the budget, but we have been through worse.
I also have to say that there are clearly fewer disagreements at the level of our committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Also, the Council has made far fewer attempts at scrapping sections than has previously been the case, so, as far as that is concerned, my congratulations to the Council.
In my view, the problems that remain are at the level of open coordination.
The Council is still tempted to say that that should be financed from the coffers of Parliament.
However, Parliament must rubber-stamp this budget, yet it is not allowed to let its voice be heard fully on that score.
We will need to hold extensive discussions on this matter once again in the years to come.
We have a number of differences of opinion on this, and I hope that those can be settled in the next couple of years.
There is another problem concerning EQUAL, one of the components of the Social Fund.
Once again, the Council has made some serious cutbacks in that area too.
Despite this, I hope that it is possible to restore the Commission' s preliminary draft in this respect.
That seems extremely important to me.
I gather that the Commission has thought very carefully about how precisely that proposal should be structured.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every year, in the context of public health provision, we consider tobacco subsidies, which are, basically, nothing other than direct income support for the interested parties.
It can be done another way.
So, as every year, we urge progressive reduction of tobacco subsidies and their replacement by increased aid for rural development with a view to alternative forms of income, which could benefit workers upstream and downstream in the regions.
The same thing happens every year, yet so far nothing has changed.
But we must always hope.
As regards the NGOs, we are always advocating support for them.
We want to know, though, what is done with the money that is granted to them, which is only right and proper.
We therefore demand that information on them be made accessible to the public on a regular basis.
Only then will we have a chance to check whether our financial support for them is justified.
Believe me, we already find it extraordinarily difficult to get any kind of overview on what organisations we are supporting.
Equally opaque, though, is the Commission's decision to stop funding the environmental organisation 'Globe' .
This is quite unjustifiable and so seems positively wilful.
It must be added that the funds accorded 'Globe' in the current budget year were not paid out.
Yet even NGOs need to be able to plan ahead with certainty in order, for example, to be able to carry on paying their office staff.
The Commission's action in this regard is anti-social.
Where there is political will, Commissioner, one can find a way, or another budget line for the future.
As regards the agencies, it does indeed appear as if some agencies had already developed active lives of their own a long time ago.
They simply exist.
So we finance them; more money every year, irrespective of output.
That seems to be all that matters.
This cannot go on, for this money is needed elsewhere.
Our task is to ensure that the organisations we support work efficiently.
Efficiency and effectiveness are not achieved merely by blindly piling-up resources, but by regular observation and monitoring, on the basis of which any necessary adjustments can be made.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I have the honour to speak for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
I would like to start by thanking my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets for the fact that nearly all the amendments produced by this committee were adopted.
We have reinstated the substance of the budget estimates for regional and transport policy that you, Commissioner, proposed.
I really must appeal to the Council not to be such a two-faced split personality.
It is not tolerable for a great hullaballoo to have been made at the Göteborg Summit about our desire for a sustainable transport policy, only for the Council to cut resources in the area of sustainable mobility.
This sort of ambiguity cannot go on, and we hope that the Council will admit that.
If you want to have a rational, environmentally responsible transport policy, you cannot cut funds that are allocated for that purpose.
My main point, though, is to do with tourism, something which did not, unfortunately, meet with favour in the Committee on Budgets.
I would, though, just ask you to think again about it.
We proposed estimates for funds to promote tourism in Europe.
You all know about the debate over many years about the 'Philoxenia' programme to attract tourist from overseas, with its slogan 'tourists to Europe' .
This topic has taken on a whole new dimension since 11 September.
Not only are the airlines getting 20%-30% fewer customers, but so are hotels in Brussels, Berlin and in all European cities.
The same is true of restaurants, souvenir shops and boutiques.
We are seeing a massive slump in tourism, specifically from the USA and Canada.
This situation is leading to major difficulties in the economy and putting jobs at risk.
I put it to the Council and the Commission that, if we are to discuss the consequences of 11 September next month, we should re-examine the question of what we are to do to promote tourism in Europe.
Mr President, at the very outset, I wish to thank Mr Costa Neves for being so understanding, as he has worked on the questions we are discussing with really great care and interest.
I am deputy chairman of the delegation to Slovakia, and we were in Slovakia last week.
Our programme included, among other things, a visit to the 'green frontier', the Ukrainian border near Kosice, where we saw that a very large number of refugees, especially from Afghanistan, were crossing the border, probably not with a peaceful purpose; it is estimated that 10% - 30% could have other activities in mind - of a terrorist or military nature, for example.
So I wish to ask the Commission and the Council, as a matter of urgency, to do everything possible to secure our borders, in particular, by immediately using the pre-accession support framework to make available the necessary apparatus on the borders that candidate States share with States not in the EU.
We are talking here about basic equipment such as night vision devices and motor vehicles, so that these frontiers can be better watched with immediate effect.
Secondly, the Committee concerned itself intensively with problems in connection with the support provided by the PHARE programmes and with the Toth case.
The Committee decided, from both a Slovakian and a European standpoint, not to put funds in reserve.
In Slovakia, the inevitable conclusions were reached.
The deputy prime minister with responsibility for this has resigned, which represents the political outcome.
The director dealing with the case has also resigned - a replacement has been appointed - and, in addition, the Slovak parliament has just passed a new law on financial monitoring and internal auditing.
So we will, I am sure, be able to take these funds out of the reserve by Second Reading.
Mr President, I just want to raise two points this evening at the same time as praising the rapporteur for the very sensible and courteous manner in which he has run the budget in advance of next year.
My first point is addressed to the Commissioner and concerns B-1 items where the Commission pays an enormous amount of money for subsidies for growing rice, bananas and the distillation of wine.
These are items I would have thought we were by now starting to reduce the payments for.
I would ask her to look at them.
I tabled many amendments amounting to hundreds of millions of euros.
I hope that rather than compulsory expenditure like that, being left to grow year by year, it should be looked at very closely.
Perhaps I could ask her to do that in advance of future budgets.
The other matter is a perennial matter which comes up each year: the European women's lobby and finance for women's organisations generally.
We tabled an amendment, and so did Mrs Avilés Perea of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, to say that the money that is voted for lobby organisations for women following the Beijing conference should not all go, as it has for many years, to the European Women's lobby.
I know many of my colleagues in the Chamber receive all sorts of letters and e-mails from around Europe saying it all must go to this one organisation.
This is wrong, we need to encourage new organisations in this very important field.
It is right and proper that the amendment that was put forward by the United Kingdom delegation was in fact passed.
This made it clear, in the remarks column, that one organisation, any single organisation within that spending line should not get more than 65%.
I trust that the approved amendment will be held to when the budget comes out.
I thank the Commissioner for her consideration.
Mr President, I want to thank Mr Costa Neves for his efforts on behalf of all of us in this procedure and to say that it is a very technical and difficult task he took on: he has discharged it with great skill and shown much patience and kindness to all of us who wanted our ideas taken into consideration.
I have not known a Commissioner who has followed the proceedings so closely or who has spent so much time with the Committee on Budgets as the present Commissioner.
Of course, in many ways this is a highly technical exercise and, unlike national budgets, it does not have much effect on the course of economic development in the European Union.
It is too small for that, even in the area of Structural Funds, for even the most generous beneficiaries receive a very small percentage of GNP.
Ireland, at the best, was getting 2%, Portugal and the poorer areas of Spain are getting between 1% and 2% of GNP.
It is not a very generous outlay of money, but if we can use it in order to guide their economic policies in the direction that we think is best, then the money can be usefully spent.
There is one idea and one hope that I have always entertained.
I believe I said some years ago that compared to national parliaments we were like children playing shop.
The amount of resources at our disposal is so small and there is so little we can do with them, but there is one area that I would like to see developed.
I do not want to see an expansion of public spending at European level.
But in the area of economic cooperation and development, if we could only pool at European level the resources which the countries of the European Union and the European Union itself devote to international cooperation and development cooperation, we could convert individual national efforts into a common European effort without increasing the sum of taxation.
This is essential if we are to develop a common foreign and security policy.
I believe we could have a much greater impact on the development of the poorer countries and redirect our foreign policy in a way that we could help the poor, help to establish peace and give us real influence in the world.
If there is one area in which we should demand subsidiarity from the national states to the European Union, it is here.
Mr President, as in previous years, this debate is characterised by two elements which we could describe as endemic.
One relates to the general amounts and the other to the deficiencies in the rules on budgetary management.
Our differences on each of the spending categories are clear and I am not going to go into the detail.
Commissioner, representatives of the Council, we need the budget to be an effective and credible tool which works for employment, for research, for support for small businesses and for the construction of a genuine area of justice and security.
Parliament has shown flexibility and austerity in this procedure and it is therefore in a position to ask the Council not to be politically autocratic and to show unequivocal signs that it is prepared to negotiate.
I trust that you will take advantage of the flexibility demonstrated by our rapporteur, Carlos Costa, whose work - as well as the efforts of the other two rapporteurs, Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Seppänen - deserves to be congratulated.
With regard to the resources intended for external Union action, we demand that this Parliament' s undeniable political objectives are guaranteed, and these include providing resources for areas which are essential to world balance, such as the Mediterranean and Latin America.
In this procedure, the Commission proposes using the flexibility instrument to finance the restructuring of the Community fleets which fished in the area of the defunct fisheries agreement with Morocco.
This decision is fair, technically correct and necessary.
It deals with a very serious problem which affects employment and a key activity of many regions, and which arises in a context of crisis.
We must remember that we are about to implement a new common fisheries policy which has been dogged by intolerable discrimination for decades when compared to other economic activities, from the point of view of internal market rules.
As for budgetary management, this Parliament has repeatedly condemned the Commission' s inability to put an end to the problem of the so-called anomalous RAL.
In this respect, we have produced a good strategy, which our rapporteur has mentioned, which is closely related to the reform of the Commission.
We must bear in mind that in the last three financial years very high payments were not used.
We must therefore find rules which work, methods which allow faster implementation and rules which shorten the cycle of projects.
As the last speaker, I hope that the Commission and the Council obey the evangelical maxim when it comes to paying attention and that the last are put first, not only in the Kingdom of Heaven, but also here in Parliament.
Mr President, I will pass on your answer to the chairman of the Committee on Budgets.
He had asked me to wait for it.
On a personal note, I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to our President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vande Lanotte, above all, who has been here with us throughout the whole of the discussions on the Budget.
Things like that do not happen all the time.
So, without wishing to seem presumptuous, I would again like to express my most heartfelt thanks to you, not only for showing us so much respect, but also for demonstrating your interest in working with us.
Many thanks!
Thank you very much, Mr Walter, for such a constructive point of order.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 10.00 a.m.
EIB: Community guarantee against lending losses
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0350/2001) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the
proposal for a Council decision granting a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under a special lending action for selected environmental projects in the Baltic Sea basin of Russia under the Northern Dimension (COM(2001) 297 - C5-0307/2001 - 2001/0121(CNS)).
. (FI) Mr President, the European Union has an easy way of helping other countries: the European Investment Bank receives guarantees for loans it grants to other countries.
The recipients of loans benefit from the EU guarantees in the form of interest rates that are lower than market rates.
This is also the case here as we are debating a loan guarantee in respect of loans granted by the EIB to Russia for environmental investments.
The maximum amount of credit is envisaged as 100 million euros.
The bank is imposing the criteria according to which the loans are to be granted.
If Russia fails to propose projects that fulfil the bank' s criteria the loans will not have to be granted.
This is a new, positive initiative that will put new life into the notion of the EU' s northern dimension, which has become rather anaemic.
The loans will be used to try to improve the state of the environment throughout the Baltic region and, eventually, therefore, the Member States of the EU also.
Parliament has not called into question the matter of loans to Russia.
The proposal has the broadest possible political support.
Problems have nonetheless been caused by the way in which the Council and the Commission are taking the matter further.
In the summer, the Commission submitted a proposal to Parliament that the loan guarantees should be issued in the same way as other EIB loans guaranteed by the EU, and that the guarantee in question should be 65%.
That is still the only proposal that the Commission has submitted to Parliament.
The Council, however, decided later to take exceptional action and insisted on adopting a full 100% guarantee in respect of the loan to Russia, rather than one of 65%.
Russia has therefore been treated differently from other recipients of EU loan guarantees.
The Commission endorsed the Council' s proposal, but it has not submitted a new proposal on the matter to Parliament.
Consequently, we, in Parliament, are debating the Commission' s original proposal for a 65% loan guarantee.
Parliament demanded a new round of consultations as a result of the revised proposal.
After all manner of talks with representatives of the Council and the Commission we have received a letter from the Council that may, with a little goodwill on our part, be interpreted as a rehearing of the Parliament.
The Commission also has indicated in writing that it has approved the 100% guarantee.
As this is a deviation from the general rule, the Committee on Budgets would have liked to have an entirely new proposal from the Commission.
The Commission said it could not submit one in time.
In this case 'in time' means it would be most beneficial to all parties if a decision could be taken on the issue this year.
There is a ceiling for EU loan guarantees, which is formed by a special Guarantee Fund.
Funds are gradually transferred to it from the Guarantee Reserves as guarantee commitments are made.
This year the ceiling is 208 million euros.
The guarantees in respect of the loans to Russia fit into this year' s envelope even though the 100% guarantee takes a larger part of it than a 65% guarantee would.
A decision is needed this year, as there are so many commitments for next year that there will be no room then at all in the Guarantee Fund for new guarantees - not for loans for environmental investments in Russia either, which is the case here.
It would take consensus on the part of all the EU institutions to raise the ceiling for guarantees and it is not always a simple matter to achieve that.
If, therefore, we want to ensure that the EIB loans will be used for Russia' s Baltic Sea basin environment, it is best to take the decision this year.
The Committee on Budgets has been ready for it, even though the action of the Council and the Commission cannot be deemed to be completely appropriate.
Thus, the committee is working on the principle that there should be no precedent set here and that similar matters should not be dealt with in this way in the future.
Parliament insists that account also be taken of the priorities it has set.
As the permanent rapporteur on loans and guarantees in the Committee on Budgets, I would like once more to draw attention to the fact that next year there will be no margin whatsoever in the Guarantee Funds for new and unexpected aid actions.
The Commission must take action accordingly.

Mr President, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy warmly supports the Council' s decision to grant a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under a lending action for environmental projects in the Baltic Sea basin of Russia.
We feel considerable unease faced with the environmental situation in that area, which is in immediate proximity to the European Union.
We believe that environmental investment in that area is required urgently and, in certain cases, even as an emergency measure.
We note that the European Investment Bank has already begun negotiations concerning participation in projects for dealing with waste water from St Petersburg and Kaliningrad.
It is important that the problems in these areas should be solved as soon as possible.
There is also reason for pointing out that environmental investment in this area can be more effective than many other investments within the Community and that major positive effects on health and the environment can be achieved for people in the European Union.
We, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, can therefore warmly support the proposal tabled.
Mr President, I should like to thank the draftsman and express my support for Mr Seppänen' s report.
In certain parts of the immediate surroundings of the European Union, the environmental problems are genuinely alarming, especially when it comes to the water in the Baltic.
EU countries are naturally affected just as much by these problems as large parts of Russia, Poland, Kaliningrad etc. To obtain clear water in the Baltic, it is crucial for us to cooperate across borders.
I, myself, live in an administrative district on the Baltic, Norrköping, where one of the greatest problems we have when it comes to water quality is that we still receive so much untreated waste from the candidate countries and from Russia.
This is a very big problem for the EU Member States too.
We know, for example, that untreated waste water from 3-4 million people in the St Petersburg region is still being released and that the situation around Kaliningrad is much the same.
Such conditions affect us all.
In order to develop this region and to get to grips with the major problems, especially at a specifically environmental level, we have created the Northern Dimension, covering a very large area from Iceland in the west to Russia in the east.
Restoring the balance in the Baltic is a measure to which exceptional priority should be given.
The matter is urgent, and that is why I am pleased that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has also expressed its wishes.
For myself, coming as I do from the Committee on Budgets, it is also a question of presenting the financial aspects of this proposal. From the Committee on Budgets, we should like to sound a warning note in this House.
The guarantee reserve that exists to cover possible credit losses is seriously stretched, both this year and next year.
The scope for this loan to Russia is really created simply through our not successfully implementing other commitments. We have had to postpone other promised projects.
Otherwise, we should not have managed to grant this loan within the framework that had been set.
If we are neither to renege on our promises in the future nor to give up our new ambitions, the Council and the Commission will therefore have to review the guarantee reserve ceiling relatively soon.
The situation is slightly reminiscent of the discussion we had in the budget debate earlier about the fact that the Council is happy to issue promises but then does not arrange satisfactory financing.
I should therefore like to ask Mr Solbes Mira what the Commission' s plans are when it comes to tabling proposals concerning the future of the guarantee reserve.
I assume the Commissioner agrees that there is a lot of pressure upon the ceiling for this reserve.
Commissioner, Mr Arvidsson, I can agree with everything that you, Mr Arvidsson, said about the importance and environmental significance of this decision.
We also know that the decision we are now discussing probably concerns the most important individual position to emerge from the meeting of the European Council in Stockholm.
I would again point out that it is the north coast of the Bay of Finland that has to receive all the waste from St Petersburg, something which leads to a particularly high degree of algal bloom.
I therefore wish to declare that I have a major interest in this issue and that the waste water from 3.5 million people has a very profound effect upon the environment and archipelago in my native Finland.
We have set a ceiling of EUR 100 million. These funds are to be used for selected projects which have clear environmental objectives and are also of considerable interest to the EU.
I believe that this is one of the critical points, if account is taken of what emerged from the discussion yesterday at the meeting of the Northern Dimension in Finland.
One Russian minister said that there is criticism of the selection criteria and wants international funding organisations to play a larger part in the project planning.
At the same time, we know that the budget of the North West Sewage Treatment Works has significantly exceeded Finland' s and the Nordic Investment Bank' s estimates.
I believe we must give a one hundred per cent guarantee. I do not believe that EUR 100 million will solve the problem.
We know that the Russian Federation does not give guarantees and that the guarantees of the city of St Petersburg are completely used up.
I, therefore, appeal to my fellow MEPs to show solidarity on this issue.
Give a one hundred per cent guarantee for this project.
It would be in our interests, and we should be gradually paving the way for greater environmental awareness in St Petersburg, something to which we must always be attentive.
The situation is significantly more complicated than Mrs Wallström imagines.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Parliament for its willingness to adopt a report on this special instrument within the Union' s Northern Dimension.
This will provide a Community guarantee for EIB loans, to a value of EUR 100 million, for the purposes of environmental projects in Russia, as you have pointed out.
As you know, this decision was adopted in a very specific way.
This is the first time that financial operations in Russia have been accepted and the operation is not only of interest to Russia but also to the bordering Union countries.
The Commission had proposed the 65% guarantee normally considered for this type of operation laid down in the general mandate of the European Investment Bank.
However, we know that the Council, for a series of reasons relating to the unique nature of this operation and the need for greater transparency, suggested that in this case a special Community guarantee of 100% was required.
The urgency of the use of resources this year has led the Commission to accept this 100%.
I do not exactly know the procedural problems which have led to the information reaching Parliament excessively late, but, according to my information, the Council informed Parliament on 20 September of the amendments under consideration, on 12 October the Belgian Presidency explained the changes in greater detail and, on the same day, the Commission sent the Committee on Budgets information on the reasons why we were accepting the Council' s amendments.
With the unanimous decision of the Council and with the Commission' s acceptance, there was no need for the Commission to present a new proposal.
We believe that it is urgent to approve this decision during 2001 for the same reasons you have raised.
A delay until 2002 would clearly hinder funding given the narrow margin for manoeuvre we have for next year.
However, this decision is not going to affect any other type of operation.
In his report, Mr Seppänen made references to other fundings: the Turkish case is the most obvious, coming from the 2000 contributions.
Actions in 2000 and 2001 have already been financed and problems of this nature do not arise.
However, another longer-term problem does arise: how are we going to handle the funding capacity of the European Investment Bank within our lending mechanism?
Mr Färm also asked what we intended to do as a Commission.
I wanted to tell you firstly that the Commission is grateful to Parliament for raising this problem of the limited capacity for indebtedness that we have within the mechanism of the Guarantee Fund.
The Commission has already raised this problem in the Council and also here in Parliament on various occasions, and we believe that, if there are new initiatives in the context of 2002, current problems will become more serious and it will be essential to take certain decisions.
The Commission is currently weighing up various options and we intend to approve an initiative relatively soon by means of a Communication which we will send to the Council and to Parliament.
I cannot respond to Mr Färm by indicating which option we are considering at the moment but I can point out that in the past we proposed a reduction in the level of coverage from 65% to 60%.
This could be one of the instruments, like any other which may be necessary, for creating a greater margin for manoeuvre in future actions.
This is what I can tell you at the moment and I would like to thank you for your cooperation in the debate on this report.
Thank you very much, Mr Solbes.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
EBRD: Community contribution to Chernobyl Shelter Fund
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0345/2001) by Mr Virrankoski, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on
the proposal for a Council decision on a second contribution of the European Community to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for the Chernobyl Shelter Fund (COM(2001) 251 - C5-0305/2001 - 2001/0113(CNS)).
Mr President, as we all remember, the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl occurred on 16 April 1986 and it is still history' s most serious nuclear accident.
Radioactive contamination affected people and nature over vast areas in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, and, furthermore, some present EU countries also suffered.
Around the destroyed unit a nuclear shelter was constructed hastily, given the conditions, to halt the spread of the pollution.
Inside the deteriorating shelter there are still more than 200 tons of uranium and almost a ton of radionuclides, of which 80% is plutonium.
The Chernobyl Shelter Fund was set up in December 1997 to finance the Shelter Implementation Plan, whose purpose it is to protect people and the environment from any new radioactive contamination.
The preliminary estimate of the cost of the project for the period 1998 - 2005 was around USD 758 million.
The first conference of the parties funding the project was held in New York in November 1997.
A total of USD 400 million was obtained in the form of pledges from twenty-five countries, of which USD 50 million was payment in kind from Ukraine.
This sum was sufficient for the first stage of the Shelter Implementation Plan.
The European Union at the start financed the shelter work with a payment of USD 100 million, which was pledged at the Denver Summit in 1997.
This amount came out of the general budget for 1998 - 1999.
A second pledging conference was held in Berlin in July 2000 to organise a final contribution to the scheme.
At that conference 22 countries in all decided to pledge around USD 320 million and the European Union pledged a further EUR 100 million for the period 2001 - 2004.
The report being discussed concerns a proposal for a Council decision on a second contribution by the European Community to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for the Chernobyl Shelter Fund.
The matter before us is thus Parliament' s opinion on the adoption of this regulation.
The current financial situation is as follows. In all, USD 716 million has been pledged to the Chernobyl Shelter Fund and this includes USD 50 million from Ukraine as an in-kind contribution.
Consequently, the fund still lacks money, as the estimate of costs is rather higher, totalling at least USD 720 - 750 million.
For this reason - as this issue is being taken forward - it must be assumed and expected that Ukraine will also be able to organise this second contribution of funds.
The problem here is that the budgetary authority in 1998 set a 13% ceiling regarding the use of TACIS appropriations in respect of nuclear safety projects.
If this were to apply, the decisions could not be taken at present in the way the Commission and the Council have proposed.
However, I support the Commission' s proposal to set aside EUR 100 million for the Chernobyl Shelter Fund as this project' s implementation is of vital importance to the people of the European Union and their safety.
I also support the Commission' s proposal that there should be a special budget heading created for it so that the way in which the funds are being used can be monitored.
Clearly, it will be difficult to use these funds as people will be working in difficult conditions in which there is a huge number of international players and where the situation is to some extent still vague in the administration of the Confederation of Independent States.
All in all, I would nevertheless support this Council proposal, with certain amendments.
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the PSE Group in support of the Virrankoski report, which gives Parliament the go-ahead to grant a further contribution - as the rapporteur himself explained - to complete the Chernobyl Shelter.
I endorse Mr Virrankoski' s reasons for his choice and, in particular, I endorse the European Union' s decision to contribute practically to creating safe conditions in the wake of the 1986 disaster.
The European Union has been the largest donor by far, not just as regards Chernobyl but also with regard to safety and preventing the nuclear contamination of the Newly Independent States.
We were right to do this: none of us can forget the 1986 disaster and nobody is yet fully aware of the devastating effects it has caused and, I regret to say, may still cause.
As Mr Virrankoski pointed out, the tomb of Chernobyl still contains 200 tonnes of uranium and a tonne of plutonium, which represent a permanent danger which might - and I stress, might - also be a prime target for traffickers.
However, this was and is still a transparent, legitimate choice in legal terms: indeed, the new Tacis regulation states that the contribution to the initiatives supported by the European Union, such as the initiative on the closure of Chernobyl, will be one of the nuclear safety priorities.
In conclusion, this was and is, above all, something which the European Union has a duty towards the new generations to do.

Mr President, I wish to address two points - first the political dimension and, secondly, the issue of cost-effectiveness and control by Parliament.
As far as the political dimension is concerned, the Chernobyl disaster showed us that the use of nuclear energy involves risks beyond our control.
No national budget can cope with such a calamity.
At present, then, discussion is limited to the securing of the casing, which is urgently needed.
This is only a fraction of the money needed to deal with the disaster as a whole.
Neither the contamination of the soil and of the water underground, nor the harm done to the health of the population are capable of being dealt with within the Ukrainian budget, and it is in a situation like this that, for reasons beyond my understanding, aid from the EU runs out.
This means that these problems will remain unresolved for generations to come.
It might be added that no Western state budget - even that of a rich Western state - could cope with such a catastrophe without international aid.
This report therefore meets with the unreserved support of us Greens and regionalists.
We do not believe, though, that this will be the last contribution towards overcoming the after-effects of Chernobyl, which will be a financial burden on East and West for generations.
This report therefore invites the question: would it not be a practical preventive measure to at last bring in a European strategy for abandoning nuclear energy?
The question also arises of whether the nuclear industry itself ought to be compelled to contribute to a fund to help deal with the disaster, for it, now as then, derives profit from East European nuclear energy.
My second point is that it seems to us that the solution for implementation is not the European Development Bank, which guarantees neither control by Parliament nor affordable solutions, for Ukrainian firms are not considered when it comes to applying the resources.
We therefore urge the Commission to avail itself of all sources of information, and not only the Development Bank, in order to supply Parliament with comprehensive and up to date information.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Virrankoski, and also Mr Pittella and Mrs Schroedter for their comments.
Given the threat to the environment throughout Europe posed by the current state of Chernobyl, it is clearly extremely important that the shelter project, or protection system, continues to be corrected, is completed and fulfils its objectives between now and 2007, as was the intention with the initial project of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
To this end, the contribution of the European Union is essential.
You have said, quite rightly, that the scale of the disaster makes funding by a single country impossible.
According to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the promised contribution now amounts to approximately USD 720 million, and therefore, also according to the Bank' s assessments, the intended timetable and costs can be met, even though certain secondary activities may be delayed.
Furthermore, certain important steps have already been taken, such as the most urgent stabilisation work, which, undoubtedly, were a great concern.
The Commission is monitoring the application of the implementation programme for shelter and is attending the meetings of the assemblies of contributors.
We have already presented a second situation report, in accordance with Council Decision 98/381/EC, and also in accordance with the guidelines contained in the report by Mr Gordon Adams on the first contribution.
In this respect, I would like to reassure Mrs Schroedter and point out that we will keep her informed.
We will keep Parliament informed.
It is true that the EBRD is not subject to Parliament' s control, but the Commission will keep Parliament informed of all activities which are being carried out by means of Union funds.
With regard to the proposals of the Committee on Budgets, the Commission believes both proposals to be acceptable, and that they enrich the Commission' s proposal.
I would, therefore, like to thank you for your contributions and for the work you have done on this issue, which is essential in preventing the risks that could have arisen in addition to the already serious effects we have suffered as a result of the Chernobyl disaster, that Mr Virrankoski has expressed so well in his initial presentation.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for your contribution, Commissioner.
We hope that you can re-gather your strength and be back with us at 11 p.m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.20 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
ESF (2000 - 2006)
The next item is the report (A5-0328/2001) by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Communication from the Commission on the implementation of innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund Regulation for the programming period 2000-2006 (COM(2000) 894 - C5-0341/2001 - 2001/2141(COS)).
rapporteur.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the concept of innovation is increasingly present in our objectives and policies at European and national level.
However, we have a unique opportunity, within the framework of the Commission communication on innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund, to approach innovation in the strategy for employment, rather than solely within the bounds of the application of new technologies.
In fact, innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund can play a vital role in increasing employment and enhancing regional and social cohesion, the sine qua non to our strategic objectives, and we must not just make use of them, we must also take action to make up for lost time and lost resources, because the guidelines for innovative measures were only finally adopted a full year after the adoption of the structural fund regulations, which made delays in implementation unavoidable.
And, apart from limited funding, resources totalling EUR 104 million have been cut from innovative measures and technical assistance in order to cover old liabilities from the previous programming period.
Similarly, despite the swingeing cuts in these resources, the Commission failed to commit some EUR 31 million during the 2000 financial year and allowed these appropriations to be cancelled instead of transferring them to the following financial year.
Today, we wish to express our satisfaction at the fact that the European Commission has responded to the call by the European Parliament for a new plan on the content of innovation, how it is to be managed, how the measures implemented are to be evaluated and the strategy for disseminating the results.
However, we also wish to express our concern as to the efficiency of this proposal, which is vaguely worded and riddled with weaknesses.
We understand, Commissioner, that innovation is a multidimensional, composite concept and, as such, hard to define and confine to specific sectors or lines of action.
At the same time, we find that there has been no fundamental evaluation of previous innovative actions, which could have provided a basis for future planning.
We also find that social partners and social agencies are lacking in experience and face difficulties in their attempt to approach this concept and design innovative measures.
That is why we propose that the European Commission should adopt fixed criteria to be taken into account in fixing support priorities for and selecting projects and to state them clearly in calls for proposals.
These criteria are: the direct relevance of projects when it comes to increasing employment, really innovative features as regards the planning and implementation of the measure, the quality and viability of the measure and the potential for the circulation and dissemination of the results within the framework of the European Social Fund.
The European Commission is also vague on the question of complementarity.
Complementarity in European policy is extremely important to the sound management of resources and their multiplier effect.
The importance of complementarity is clear from this morning's debate.
However, I believe, Commissioner, that complementarity should under no circumstances mean that innovative measures will lose their specific and distinctive character, nor should it mean the deletion of budget lines referring to related but separate sectors of activities.
The description of thematic fields is also vague, especially when it comes to the social partners.
The social partners have an important role to play.
We all support it but they themselves are ignorant of it.
They themselves are ignorant both of the potential which European policy affords them and of the extent of their responsibility for creating a real European job market and increasing employment at local level.
We need to help them, perhaps with some clearer guidelines and examples.
It would be more helpful as regards the substance of innovative measures if, when defining the thematic fields for 2002 and subsequent years, the European Commission consulted the European Parliament and the Committee on the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee before announcing the thematic sectors.
We particularly welcome your reference, Commissioner, to equal opportunities and believe that this principle should distinguish not just how men and women are treated but also access to the policy on innovative measures by regions which lack innovation and face particular structural problems, such as mountain and island regions.
If we believe that a quantum leap beyond our standard policies is needed in this sector of activity by the European Social Fund, then this also needs to be expressed in the policy for evaluating and disseminating results.
We believe that the European Commission should design pioneering methods which are more penetrating and efficient than those applied to date.
Setting up a special unit to manage innovative measures is a good move and we hope that it will be suitably staffed by officials who can help it carry out its duties.
Of course, your efforts alone will not suffice and the Member States must not be left out of this process.
The dissemination of information and technical assistance for interested parties need to be promoted through specially staffed units operating in an optimum manner at regional level.
Mr President, Commissioner, this report on the implementation of innovative measures laid down in the European Social Fund, which has been so well produced by the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, considers innovative measures and pilot projects on a European level relating to labour markets, professional employment and training, study, exchange of experience and also Community dialogue, which is an extremely important instrument for the creation of jobs and social cohesion.
The priority objective of the European Union, as laid down at the Lisbon Summit, is to turn the European Union into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic development, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
This objective, which we all wish to achieve, demands innovative measures to integrate groups with special difficulties into the labour market.
Notable in this respect is the need to maintain the objective of equal opportunities, since the presence of women in the labour market is still insufficient.
The partnership between the different actors in the economy, as well as the choice of issues to be tackled, will help to achieve the proposed objective.
Thank you very much.
Mr President, this Commission communication is for the most part disappointing, especially because it lacks a clear, concise description of the substance of the intended innovation.
Precisely this defect can prove detrimental to the effectiveness of the Regulation.
From the point of view of subsidiarity, these innovative actions are to be called into question.
What is the specific added value which these actions should yield?
In this respect, the communication is bogged down in vague descriptions.
There is thus a major risk of the Commission backing useful actions which would also be implemented without ESF subsidy because national or local authorities have already recognised their usefulness.
The fact that there is still no assessment report on the innovative actions in the previous programming period (1994-1999) should ring alarm bells with the budgetary authority.
Furthermore, the Commission has planned considerable economy measures for the period 2000-2006.
Can the Commissioner indicate the reason for these measures?
And can the Commissioner also explain why the assessment report is still pending, and when it will be submitted to us?
I share the critical tone of the report.
A weak area in the report is the pursuit of a European labour market.
This is still pie in the sky, given the language barriers, cultural differences and the different national systems for taxes, social security and pensions.
Europe' s most important trait is its diversity, and that is why Europe cannot be compared to the United States of America.
Experiences with ESF subsidies in the Netherlands indicate that it has been unclear on more than one occasion as to what can and cannot be subsidised.
According to the Dutch Court of Auditors, this is partly due to the loose and opaque wording of EU legislation.
Even if a conflict of interest is unlikely in connection with support for innovative actions, I still wonder if the present communication has been tested sufficiently for the risk of exploitation and improper use.
I should like to congratulate Mrs Kratsa on her report on innovative measures under Article 6 and to agree, both with Mrs Kratsa and the other speakers, that there are two basic issues in which we share an interest.
The first is optimising the application of Article 6 and the second is having the best, most efficient relations between the European Parliament and the Commission.
As far as the application of Article 6 is concerned, the unit which deals solely with Article 6 was created, staffed and started operating in December 2000.
This means that we were able to focus on implementing it and we have made satisfactory progress.
The first stage of the programme has already been announced with the call for proposals on the subject of adapting to the new economy within the framework of social dialogue.
This was announced in February 2001.
A second call for proposals on the subject of local strategies for employment and innovation is also ready and is due to be published at the end of October.
The first call was a complete success.
A large number of transnational plans was received in which social partners, trades unions and employers, as well as local authorities and companies played a very important part.
The evaluation of these plans was strengthened at the European Parliament's request and now we do not just evaluate each plan individually, we also evaluate the measures as a whole so that we can assess their complementarity.
I must say that particular account was taken in the calls for proposals of the 4 points on which Parliament also focused.
As far as working with Parliament is concerned, I can tell you that we are about to officially submit the first report on the implementation of the previous Article 6 period which is now ready - a copy has already been sent to Mrs Kratsa through official channels - and the communication makes provision for an annual report from the European Social Fund to the European Parliament on the application of Article 6.
The first of these reports is being drafted and should be submitted to you within the next few months.
Of course, there are other ways of working together and exchanging more views.
I think that Article 6 and its implementation could be a special item for the joint parliamentary and Commission committee on the European Social Fund, but there are other fora in which views can be exchanged.
One of these is due to take place on 18 December and everyone in charge of the social dialogue plans selected will be invited.
Naturally we hope Parliament will also attend.
Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Equal treatment for men and women in employment
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0358/2001), by Mrs Hautala, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on a Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and working conditions (9848/1/2001 - C5-0387/2001 - 2000/0142(COD)).
Mr President, in this second reading I would like to present a legal report that is broad in scale.
Its purpose is to bring up to date the European Union' s most important directive regarding equality at work, which was originally enacted in 1976.
Society has changed a great deal in a quarter of a century, so the Committee has worked hard to bring all the issues being raised in modern times to this report.
I would like to thank my colleagues and the other political groups for the intensive, fruitful co-operation we have had prior to this second reading also.
Firstly, for the first time, the Commission has proposed binding action for the Member States to adopt in order to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace.
Up till now there have just been recommendations and there have been very different practices among the various Member States.
Now the European Parliament is repeating its demand, which the Council has not approved, that the Member States should oblige employers to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace.
The Committee has found that a certain system that may be very useful in preventing and remedying damage resulting from sexual harassment is that each workplace should have a confidential counsellor people can turn to in such cases.
Another important issue is that the directive seeks to strengthen rights associated with maternity, adoption and parenthood in general and to protect mothers in particular - but also fathers - from the sort of discrimination shown to young parents.
Every day we hear examples of how employers still ask young women whether they intend to have children in the next few years, and this is how a very large number of people seeking employment might become the victims of serious discrimination.
This has already been illegal in the past but this discrimination must still be absolutely prevented.
The European Parliament is proposing that this directive will serve to bring this about once and for all.
This also covers the issue whereby a person must have the right to return to the same job, or at least a similar one, and with the same terms and conditions of employment, after a period of maternity leave, for example.
As rapporteur, I have tabled an amendment in which I also want to emphasise that the unfavourable treatment of fathers must be declared to be discrimination forbidden under this directive.
It is absolutely vital that Parliament tomorrow adopts the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and some groups, in which both fathers and mothers are protected and which refer, for example, to exercising the right to parental leave, so that discrimination cannot take place.
We all understand how important co-ordinating work and family life is for young families and our children too.
It is excellent to see that recently the Commission has also realised that day care is an important matter and that it will be possible in this way to raise the employment rate for women to that for men in order to increase the number of employees.
That obviously does not happen unless there is a good system of day care.
This directive does not lay down legal provision for new rights, but seeks to protect those who want to exercise their rights - both fathers and mothers - from discrimination at work.
Parliament is proposing that the plans for equality in the workplace be adopted.
This is a very strategic proposal, as equality must be actively and systematically promoted at grassroots level, in other words, where people work.
It has been a joy to see that employers' organisations have also actually approved this idea.
I hope that we will get wide support for this proposal.
I would like to thank the Commission for its very constructive attitude.
I believe that, united, we will see a decision taken on this directive soon.
If the Council does not approve all Parliament' s proposals legislative conciliation may be begun very swiftly.
Mr President, there is a German proverb that says good things are worth waiting for.
However, I remain to be convinced, especially now that I have heard what the rapporteur had to say, that everything will turn out for the best in tomorrow's vote on the recommendation for a second reading on the directive amending the important 1976 directive.
I honestly have to say that the progressive Council common position came as a pleasant surprise after the botched first reading in this House, which my group had very little to do with.
I could even have lived with the text proposed by the Council.
We could have avoided the risks of having too many new amendments at this stage and wasting valuable time on laborious negotiations on resolutions.
But that was not to be, since the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities once again failed to recognise the truism that the better is the enemy of the good.
Because of our persistence, Mrs Ghilardotti and I, the spokespersons of the two major groups in this House, which are needed to muster 314 votes, have succeeded in persuading the rapporteur not to table yet more superfluous amendments which really give women out there very little except semantic self-opionatedness and confused ideology.
We now have before us a number of new amendments from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to which the rapporteur belongs.
This directive is one of the EU's most important pieces of legislation.
It needs to be clear and legally tenable.
Above all, it should not be overloaded with excessive verbiage that really has no place in a legal text which will have to be interpreted by the judges of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
Those judges to whom I have read the newly tabled definitions of harassment and sexual harassment in the workplace are totally horrified.
In particular, I wish to emphasise that the Council has recognised men's right to paternity leave.
We really had to use our powers of persuasion to convince the rapporteur not to include in the text the idea that not only any discrimination against women but also against men in connection with pregnancy or maternity should be regarded as discrimination in the context of this directive.
However, we ultimately succeeded in making it clear that men can still not become pregnant and accordingly cannot give birth!
At the last moment, the rapporteur - who tabled an amendment contrary to the agreement we had reached - wanted to reinsert a provision to the effect that discrimination against men and women in the context of reconciling family and career duties counts as discrimination for the purposes of the directive.
This would have no benefit at all, apart from encouraging litigation, and especially litigation advocated by people who exploit woolly provisions of this kind.
Many of us still have problems with legal actions taken by associations and the requirement for employers to produce complicated annual reports and statistics.
Then I would like to mention equal pay.
There is a directive dating from 1975 on equal pay for equal work or work of equal value.
That directive is certainly in need of improvement, but in its own context and not this one.
We are calling on the Member States to take measures to ensure that employers promote equal pay for equal work in a planned and systematic way.
That is mistaken for a number of reasons.
First of all, there is the autonomy of the two sides of industry - the employers and the unions.
In this context, any demand that employers should promote equal pay for equal work would fall short of the provisions of the 1975 equal pay directive.
There is a French proverb that says 'Superflue, chose très nécessaire' .
However, that does not apply to legislative texts.
I hope that in the interests of equal treatment of men and women we will concentrate on the essentials and eliminate anything superfluous when we vote tomorrow.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, for her willingness to take into account the considerations and the work of all the political groups.
The report she is tabling today and upon which we are to vote tomorrow shows that Parliament has focused on the most important points, which will improve the common position, in order to achieve the adoption of the amendments to the directive with all speed.
Although the common position recognised Parliament' s position at first reading on a precise definition of direct and indirect discrimination - which we welcome - we feel that it is necessary - and this is an important amendment - to provide precise definitions of harassment, sexual harassment and the procedures for combating it, including preventive measures.
We also feel that it is important to keep our amendment reducing the derogations provided for by the Commission and the Council in respect of the implementation of the directive, and that it is necessary to reinforce protection of maternity and paternity rights, including in cases of adoption, providing effective safeguards against discrimination against parents using the rights they are entitled to.
There is one point which I am sure will be discussed in conciliation, for the Commission too expressed reservations regarding this point in its amended position, and it is the provision for positive measures laying down specific advantages.
We felt that it was important to include them because that consolidates the provisions of the Treaty.
Another important point which we feel should still be included is the laying down of effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, leaving it to the Member States to identify procedures, an issue which we have also addressed in other debates in this very Chamber and which we endorsed with the vote on the report on information and consultation.
Moreover, it is necessary to make clear, as we have done, the concept of protection for victims, the extension of this protection to trade union representatives and the need for the bodies created to apply the principle of equality to be provided with adequate resources so that they can lend appropriate legal and other assistance to the victims of gender discrimination.
We must also clarify the provision made for collective action to be brought in the event of breaches of the directive and the requirement for employees to draw up equal opportunities plans.
The Socialist Group will vote for all the amendments adopted in committee.
Regrettably, however, I have to tell the rapporteur that we do not support the two amendments she tabled together with the Liberals and the GUE, not so much as regards the content as because we feel they do not achieve anything substantial in legislative terms and, on the contrary, inappropriately go against the compromise reached, which I hope will be confirmed tomorrow with a very wide majority in this House to give us more power in conciliation.
Mr President, the rapporteur has made every effort to reach consensus.
She therefore deserves all credit for the emphatic result that is now before us.
Many necessary improvements have been made to the measures against sexual intimidation and in connection with adoption leave and a woman' s right to return to her old job after maternity leave.
If the Commission and the Council are serious about the equal treatment of men and women, they would do well to adopt all these amendments.
I was astonished to find out from my Christian-Democratic counterparts that pregnancy is a purely female issue.
On the contrary: it is of the utmost importance for men to be given the opportunity to be more involved in the new life that they have helped create.
The joint amendment that is before us does not create new rights.
We simply do not want men who wish to make use of their existing national rights, for example, to three -days' leave, to be prevented from doing so.
In the view of the liberal group, unlike that of the two major groups, it consequently seems hardly too much to ask for men and women to be able to make use of existing rights to combine work and care tasks without experiencing discrimination.
We do live, after all, in the twenty-first century.
Needless to say, the green-liberal-GUE amendment on mainstreaming is also an important addition.
I therefore hope that the others will also support us in this and that we indeed face a more equal future backed by a broad majority.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the original Commission proposal, with the exception of a few positive measures, has to be described as extremely weak, to put it mildly.
It contains a number of major failings.
There were hardly any innovative ideas in it, except for how to tackle sexual violence, something which, for a directive which is already 25 years old, is telling.
However, it is, of course, positive that sexual intimidation is recognised as a form of discrimination, particularly against women, but recognition is as far as it goes.
There is no regulation providing for a possible preventative policy, and the protection of witnesses is not regulated properly either.
In addition, there is no coherent regulation of sanctions in the event of this form of discrimination taking place.
It can be likened to driving through a set of red traffic lights.
You are allowed to drive, no one is stopping you from doing so, and no measures are taken.
Moreover, the penalty is extremely lenient.
In order to protect women better after pregnancy, in those countries where this is regulated, fathers should be given the same protection as mothers, so that work and family life can be combined.
Hence, also the green amendment to establish one regulation for both mothers and fathers so that fathers can look after their children more but are also protected in the same way.
There is a clear majority in this House in favour of regulating a number of more specific matters.
Most of these matters, however, belong in other and separate directives, such as the pregnancy directive and equal pay for equal work.
In recent years, the Commission has proved unable to draft a number of amendments to directives which are more tailored to the current needs of women.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance therefore urges the Commission once again to table amendments of this kind to existing directives, possibly in the form of a codification of the male and female equality acquis.
We are meanwhile awaiting the Commission proposal on male and female equality outside the employment process with bated breath.
Finally, I should like to express the hope that the Belgian Presidency, given its own progressive legislation in this respect, succeeds in convincing the Member States of the importance of approving the directive by 2 January and that it can approve this directive under the Presidency of Mrs Onkelinkx.
Mr President, Mrs Diamantopoulou, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Hautala for her unstinting effort, prior to the summer and also today, in wanting to give the Commission' s proposal some structure, whilst reiterating the need for specific directives, such as equal pay, protection during pregnancy and motherhood, and now the recognition of types of harassment, and that of the reconciliation of family and working life.
Thank you, Mrs Hautala, for having done so much work, which was not easy.
I would now like to explain why the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and I support the amendment by Mrs Hautala.
The Commission is certainly willing to recognise the right of fathers to look after their children. We have the recommendation on the protection of workers who look after their children.
Why stop, though, when things are going so well?
We now need, and this is the purpose of our amendment, to acknowledge that inequality, or discrimination in other words, can exist, with regard to fathers, when they want to look after their children.
Why did the Committee on Women' s Rights not go this far?
Personally, I do not understand this and I would hope that we are a little more reasonable in the future.
What will happen if we are?
Not only more quibbling, as Mrs Lulling believes, but, quite simply, better recognition of what is needed - not only by women, but by men as well - in order to be able to have both a family and a career.
If we do not do both, we are not living in the twenty-first century, as Mrs van der Laan said.
That is why I believe that this amendment simply provides the possibility of extending the right of fathers, something that we also hope for and want to acknowledge.
That is why I think it is important to support this amendment.
In addition, I would now like to highlight several points that are new in these proposals for amendments.
On the one hand, the introduction of adoption is very important, this is something new, which we must weigh up.
Next, I must say that my group supports the need to set out some positive measures.
We must not be satisfied with dealing with this at arm's length, we must clearly define these measures and this is what has been done, as a solid legal instrument will be the result.
I feel that we must also support the possibility of associations and organisations commencing proceedings.
In doing this, we recognise that there will not just be individuals faced with a law or faced with proceedings, but also bodies which can support these individuals.
This may be the reason that, whilst it is worthwhile, and whilst we can welcome the protection of workers' representatives who support complainants against discrimination, on the other hand, we have done away with the protection of possible witnesses, or of individuals who witness the harassment or discrimination that some individuals experience, and I think this is a real pity.
I personally deplore this, even though we did not table an amendment on this for tomorrow.
Mr President, Mrs Diamantopoulou, ladies and gentlemen, these are the points that I wanted to make, on behalf of my group.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her work.
Parliament has stressed on many occasions that equal opportunities for men and women must be more than just a principle.
Equal opportunities is a concept, a definition which must be translated into a genuine effort by the institutions to ensure, first and foremost, genuine equal treatment of men and women as regards access to work and professional training.
What is more, working women must also be able to choose whether to take the opportunity to have a family and bring up children without this jeopardising their professional careers through no fault of their own.
Indeed, society must be re-educated to see motherhood not just as a woman' s right but also as an opportunity for society as a whole, considering, not least, that one of the causes of the falling birth rate is precisely the fact that many women are discouraged from having children by the rigid mechanisms of the employment world.
For precisely this reason, we need not just to ensure that a woman has the right to resume her job when maternity leave comes to an end but, in order to genuinely protect working mothers, we need to be able to provide them with more flexible legislation on parental leave, allowing fathers to benefit from paternity leave too so that they can attend to the child during its first few months of life.
In conclusion, Mr President, the European Union should increasingly promote all such instruments - social, legal and economic - which can provide strong, practical - as opposed to theoretical - support for women, especially working women, and thus provide strong support for families.
Mrs Lulling, I would like to thank you for livening up this evening' s sitting. These sittings can sometimes be rather monotonous, but I would like to remind you of our Rules of Procedure.
You must, in principle, wait until the end of the debates if you wish to make a personal statement, and you have limited speaking time.
You spoke for more than two minutes.
I think, however, that your fellow Members now have a much clearer understanding of your position.
We shall now take the speakers who wish to make a personal statement, beginning with Mrs Avilés Perea.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are dealing with the second reading of a directive which is important for the application of the principle of equal treatment for men and women, in terms of access to employment, training, professional promotion and working conditions.
This directive has led to many hours of work, meetings and agreements between the different groups in order to achieve a text that is acceptable to the majority of the House, as well as the Council and the Commission.
It has not been easy, but foremost has been the desire for a legal text which is a good instrument for providing women with equal access to the labour market under equal conditions and for allowing them to reconcile family and professional lives, which still causes women enormous problems, especially young women.
Article 1(2), which guarantees that women retain their job after maternity leave, is of the greatest importance.
Not because it is an innovation, since it is included in most national legislations, but because, despite this, retaining jobs and continuing professional promotion after maternity are still creating enormous problems for women.
These problems principally affect women, but the directive lays down that, when a father has paternity leave, he can have the same guarantees as women, although this leave is after the specific leave for childbirth, which is exclusive to women.
Also included are positive measures which promote the presence of the least-represented sex in a specific working sector, in order to allow greater equality between men and women.
It is also important to stress that the directive deals with a work problem which unfortunately affects women more than men: sexual harassment, which will not only be prosecuted and punished, but prevention measures will also be adopted in companies.
Although we are aware that small companies may have problems complying with this directive, we believe that it is an important achievement for equality between men and women.
I hope that in the end it will help women and not create additional problems for them.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Hautala very sincerely for the enormous amount of work that we have achieved together here.
This proposal became necessary because appeals had been made to the European Court of Justice in over 40 cases.
The most prominent cases, which we in the European Parliament have also been very much involved in, a point I would like to reiterate, were the Kalanke and Marshall cases.
These cases have important ramifications not only in Germany, but have also led to a degree of legal uncertainty throughout the Union.
The anti-discrimination provisions of Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and Articles 141 and 3 give us a clear legal basis for amending this directive now so as to improve the position of women.
Many of the extensive amendments at first reading are reflected in the common position.
That is our first achievement.
Direct and indirect discrimination, sexual harassment in the workplace, positive action - these are now all covered by the common position.
Nevertheless, we are now going a step further.
We want to protect not only mothers but also fathers, something that, as is reflected here, originally met with some resistance in this House.
But that is what we expect.
I think that we now need to find some clearer wording.
In the course of various extended working sessions, we have managed to achieve a broad consensus in this Parliament on 15 compromise proposals.
I accordingly wish to recommend that my group should stick to this compromise.
Our objective remains that of rapidly improving the position of both men and women who are committed to their family, and working towards reconciling professional and family commitments.
We want to create a clear legal framework.
That is why if it proves necessary we want to initiate the conciliation procedure as quickly as possible.
We hope that the compromise before us here will hold up and that the Commission and the Council will accordingly also display a willingness to agree, for the benefit of women.
The report by Mrs Hautala tackles the subject of equality between men and women as regards access to employment.
As far as access to the floor is concerned, this equality has not been respected this evening.
Rest assured, this is something that I regret, as we had 16 female speakers to just one male speaker.
We shall therefore listen even more closely to what he says over the next two minutes.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Hautala for a good piece of work.
If it had only depended upon herself, the result could certainly have been still better, but we have to be able to live with compromises, and these are important steps that are now being taken to move closer to equality in Europe.
The right to equal conditions at the workplace is a fundamental right and should go without saying.
That is unfortunately not the case.
The issue is one of human dignity and of avoiding harassment, something with which everyone ought to agree.
In spite of this, we know that many women in Europe are at present exposed to sexual harassment on a daily basis.
A genuine change in attitude is needed, but also clear and vigorous legislation if we are to create equal opportunities in working life.
The present values also lead to large discrepancies in salaries between men and women.
I nonetheless think it is important to say that equal opportunities for men and women are not in actual fact only a women' s issue. It is an issue that affects us all, irrespective of our gender.
Rights are needed which make it possible for both mothers and fathers to combine professional and family life.
Maternity and paternity leave must obviously be brought into line with each other.
My own experience teaches that equality must begin in the home.
I sometimes think that the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities does not do enough to include us men in its view of equality.
I think that that is a pity and is in danger of delaying more resolute work for equality within the European Union.
I should like to conclude by saying that I feel dissatisfied with Amendment 7.
I do not think that the wording goes far enough.
Every mother and father must be entitled to return to her or his own work after parental leave. I emphasise his or her own work.
The wording, work of equal value is not enough, for there is then a risk of employers less conscious of their responsibilities exploiting this opportunity to create worse conditions for parental leave.
Unfortunately, there are many such examples in my own country, too.
I should therefore have liked to have seen clearer wording.
Allow me an additional ten seconds - given that Mrs Lulling was given an extra two minutes - and allow me to say to the latter that my marriage would never have survived if my wife and I had not shared the parental leave equally.
In view of the fact that Mrs Lulling spoke so clearly, all of us in this House understand that Amendment 17 will of course be supported by Mrs Lulling, and for that I am very grateful.
Thank you.
Mr President, I should first of all like to thank Mrs Hautala but say at the same time that the best is often the enemy of the good.
The two amendments that were tabled subsequently by Mrs Hautala have caused a great deal of difficulty, for a large majority of people who are already unhappy about this directive have found in these amendments a reason to vote against a whole host of things.
And in the knowledge that 314 votes must be attained, you should have acted more wisely.
Approval of the present compromise is far more important than submission of your two additional amendments.
I should like to make this clear to you: it was a poor strategy.
For my second point, I should like to address the Commission.
Back in 1993, I drafted a Royal Decree in which I made it compulsory for businesses to draw up an annual report about equal opportunities for men and women in their businesses.
That Royal Decree goes beyond what is stated in the present text, since the latter merely encourages them, whereas my piece of legislation was binding.
Commissioner, I have to say, if you want this to yield results, there will need to be consultation with the social partners - much more so than is now the case - and there will need to be agreement with them to apply the provisions of the laws and the directives.
For our big problem is not the legislator.
He will faithfully transpose what is in the European directives, sometimes too late, but it is done, anyway.
Our big problem is the application in the field, and that is in the hands of the social partners.
Equal pay and the equal treatment, and whatever else, of women is never a priority for trade unions and employers.
In my opinion, the Commission and the Member States would do well to emphasise this.
Mr President, imagine if men in Europe earned 25 per cent less than women.
Imagine if one in two men were subject to sexual harassment. Imagine if European men were over-represented in precarious, low-skilled part-time jobs and were given their notice when they told their employers that they intended to have children.
Imagine if the proportion of men in Europe' s national parliaments were only 20 per cent.
The mind boggles.
However, it is women, and not men, who are discriminated against in this way.
'A new way of thinking is required in order to solve the problems created by the old way of thinking,' as Albert Einstein once said.
I want to congratulate Mrs Hautala who has worked to find a new way of solving the problems entailed in the EU' s out-of-date Directive on Equal Treatment.
The proposal on which we are to vote tomorrow lays the foundation for clear and effective legislation in the Member States to protect women and men from gender discrimination at work.
Countries must take active measures to promote equality in practice.
What is perhaps most important is Mrs Hautala' s demand that public and private employers in Europe must, in a planned and systematic way, prevent gender discrimination, harassment and unequal treatment.
It is no longer enough to react after the employee has complained.
Employers are encouraged to draw up annual equality plans with statistics concerning differences in salaries and the proportion of women and men at different levels and with proposed measures to combat this state of affairs.
Employers should be responsible for ensuring that their employees are not harassed and that they have equal wages for equal work and the opportunity to pursue careers and, especially, to combine work and family life.
I assume that the Council is prepared to approve our proposals. Only then shall we have an instrument for removing the extensive discrimination against women in working life.
Mr President, the amendment to the 1976 directive is a very important move and illustrates the Commission's sensitivity on the question of equal treatment for men and women.
For its part, the Committee on Women's Rights, thanks to the sterling efforts of our rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, and other honourable Members, has helped to produce an improved text today which attracts a broader consensus.
That is why we expect it to be warmly supported by both the Commission and the Council.
The new directive certainly responds to the change in the situation which has taken place over the last twenty-five years as regards women's employment and vocational training and replaces an outdated legislative framework which has done what it can to combat discrimination against women, serious infringements of the principle of equality, higher unemployment rates, the exclusion of women from numerous professions and the general division of the job market along gender lines.
I should like to inform the House that the Greek Parliament recently voted almost unanimously to replace a similar article in the Constitution allowing derogations from the principle of sexual equality on the labour market.
The Hautala report suggests a new, better, framework and introduces new types of measures, such as measures to prevent and combat sexual harassment in the workplace, efficient protection for workers from unequal treatment related to pregnancy and maternity, judicial protection, positive measures to apply equality in practice, as other Members have pointed out, and sanctions to punish infringements of the directive.
However, I feel that the directive could be clearer in defining purely objective selection criteria for all jobs and should not leave loopholes for gender-based exceptions and exclusions.
Mr President, this directive is tremendously important to the future of Europe because it regulates matters which concern the whole of society - men and women alike - and is a way of achieving fundamental strategic objectives of the European Union, as laid down in the EC Treaty, Articles 2 and 3, and the European Social Agenda.
It absolutely must update this directive if it is to be an efficient means of achieving these objectives.
The reform of the directive has been a dogged and, at times, difficult procedure, as happens when we try to adopt a correct, binding and efficient text.
Both the rapporteur and all the political groups showed willing, although it was difficult to strike a balance between the ambitious objectives set by the European Union for women's employment and the quality of jobs, the already high acquis communautaire on equal treatment for men and women and the exceptional, high-level performance by certain Member States which have gone beyond the proposals for the directive (Mrs Karamanou and Mrs Smet referred to experiences in Greece and Belgium) and the real need to maintain flexibility and the status of female employment during a downswing in the economy and on the labour market, help speed up cooperation with the Council and the European Commission and avoid overburdening the text with important women's issues such as equal pay, which are dealt with elsewhere, and achieve the consensus and majority needed.
In my personal experience, this procedure has given all of us, European institutions, national governments, social partners and social agencies, a more responsible attitude to women's problems and to the importance of female employment to our development objectives.
I think that this mature attitude will also find expression in tomorrow's vote.
The views of my political group have been stated and I share them.
Personally, I support Amendment No 17 on the recognition of paternity as a factor in the strategy to promote new working conditions, as a factor in the balanced participation of men and women in family and professional life and as acknowledgement of the social values of family life and support for women in their multiple and simultaneous roles.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion is a stated objective that we all share.
The only disagreement is about how we should achieve this, and there is ultimately the question of how effective individual measures are, or whether such measures just mean more rules and regulations, and extra expenditure and bureaucracy, which we certainly do not need.
The Council has not taken all Parliament's demands on board in its common position.
Nevertheless, it is true to say that the text of the original proposal has been considerably improved upon.
This means that we have taken an important step on the road to updating the Community legislative framework.
However, a number of issues and problem areas remain to be resolved.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has closely examined all these unresolved questions, and a decision has been reached between the groups not to re-examine all the outstanding demands, but rather the most important.
The rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, has made enormous efforts in order to work out viable compromises.
We have the result before us.
It emerged from the first reading debate that paternity rights cannot be the same as maternity rights.
The compromise accordingly does not affect Member States' freedom to recognise the right to paternity leave within their borders.
Both mothers and fathers should have the option of devoting themselves to family duties.
This - in contrast to the opinion that we have heard expressed here - is undeniably the stated objective of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats.
Furthermore, the formula whereby a woman on maternity leave should be entitled, after the end of her period of maternity leave, to return to her job or to an equivalent post must be taken on board.
However, we have problems with the definition of sexual harassment.
We seem to have ended up with a rather woolly form of words here that is not helpful for any judge or other person that has to make a decision on this.
Lastly, I would like to make one further brief comment opposing the annual reporting arrangements for employers on progress with equal treatment.
Bureaucracy alone will not promote equal treatment.
We also need to think about small and medium-sized enterprises so that they too accept women looking for jobs.
Mr President, Commissioner, this evening, we are discussing the equal treatment of men and women with regard to access to employment, occupational training and chances of promotion, and with regard to working conditions.
In actual fact, it is astonishing that we should still be discussing this topic, because we have been discussing it for so long, and virtually everyone is convinced, both men and women, that such equal treatment is fair and does not and should not have to be justified.
However, we are not yet that far advanced, unfortunately.
To this day, women are being treated as inferior and discriminated against, also in working situations.
The combination of work and care still poses problems in many cases.
That is why I am pleased with this report.
I am also pleased that we were able to find a compromise text concerning a number of important points.
I therefore hope that the voting tomorrow will be positive so that it can truly represent a step forward in the process of equal treatment.
The report encourages States and organisations involved to take measures in favour of equal treatment and to combat sexual intimidation.
Better legal protection is given and, for example, opportunities are given to return to work following pregnancy or in connection with adoption.
In addition, we will gain a better insight into the actual situation concerning participation of men and women and we shall have access to better, updated statistics.
That is why I should like to extend warm thanks to the Commission for the initiative.
I should also like to thank the rapporteur warmly for all her efforts to persuade us to sing from the same song sheet, but a special thanks goes to all those who have worked hard on this broadly-based text.
I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, and I would like to thank all the Members of the committee for their efforts and excellent contributions in this difficult and complex area.
I am aware of your concerns to improve the text of the common position on which there was unanimous agreement in the Council on 11 June 2001.
As you know from the first reading, the Commission accepted in spirit the majority of your amendments - 49 amendments of a total of 70 - and consequently drew up an amended proposal which reflected this position.
In general it should be stressed that the common position considerably enhances the text of the initial proposal and responds to the desire to update the text of Directive 76/207.
We must now focus on the most essential issues of the directive and make a concerted effort to find possible solutions to improve even further the common position.
As you know, the Council only reached an agreement after long discussions on issues such as the precise wording of the definitions and the article on maternity and paternity leave, on which it was very difficult to reach agreement in the Council.
The compromise therefore is extremely delicate.
On the other hand I feel that the Council could make further compromises in areas such as equality plans, the role of bodies for the promotion of equality and the introduction of preventive measures to combat sexual harassment.
In this context the Commission can accept the following amendments.
On Amendments Nos 1 and 5, on preventive measures against sexual harassment the Commission can accept in part the idea of introducing measures for preventing sexual harassment by reformulating the text.
Instead of obliging employers to introduce preventive measures, it would be preferable to encourage employers to do so.
On Amendment No 8, on positive measures, the Commission can accept this amendment in part if a definition is contained in the recitals instead of the article of the directive.
On Amendment No 9, on provisions in contracts and agreements, the Commission accepts that annulment should be obligatory but rejects the removal of the possibility for amendment of the contract.
Here there is the need for flexibility.
On Amendment No 13, on the role of the independent budgets, the Commission can accept this amendment in part by reformulating the proposed text.
The text of the common position could be improved by strengthening the role of bodies for the promotion of equal treatment and by adding to their tasks the monitoring and follow-up of Community legislation in the field of equal treatment.
The Commission can also accept a reformulation of Article 6(3), by expressly mentioning that designated bodies acting on behalf of victims have an interest in ensuring that the provisions of the directive are complied with.
On Amendment No 14, on equality plans and the company level, the Commission can accept this idea in part, but with a new formulation for Article 8(b).
On Amendment No 15, on reporting on positive action measures, the Commission will propose an alternative text so as to report on positive measures only every three years.
On Amendment No 16 on gender mainstreaming, the Commission accepts this amendment partially and in spirit, but only to the extent that it respects the wording of the Treaty.
Now I should like to turn to those amendments which cannot be accepted by the Commission.
Amendment No 4, rewording the common position's definition of sexual harassment, in order to take into account Parliament's definition of sexual harassment.
Amendments Nos 7 and 17 reformulating the text of the common position on maternity and paternity leave by reintroducing inter alia the idea of maternity and paternity leave where children are adopted.
The common position was hotly debated in the Council on this issue and a delicate compromise was reached.
It is unlikely therefore that any further change would be accepted.
Here I would just like to remind you that there is, of course, the paternity leave directive - the first to be adopted following an agreement between the social partners.
The Commission did not accept Amendment No 11 on group action in cases of discrimination - especially without the consent of the victim of discrimination.
On Amendments Nos 2, 3, 6, 10 and 12, the Commission considers that the content of these amendments is already covered by the common position.
To sum up, the Commission can accept in part or in spirit Amendments Nos 1, 5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 and 16.
It rejects Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 and 17.
Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
6th, 7th and 8th EDF discharge for 1999
The next item is the second report (A5-0337/2001) by Mrs Rühle, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge in respect of the financial management of the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Funds for the 1999 financial year.
I shall now give the floor to Mrs Rühle, who has five minutes' speaking time.
Mr President, I am today proposing that the Commission should be given discharge in respect of the financial management of the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Funds for the 1999 financial year.
Unfortunately, we had to postpone the discharge in the spring, because I as rapporteur had received insufficient information from the Commission.
This information is now available and I would like to specifically thank the Commission for its cooperation.
I can recommend discharge today without any reservations.
Nevertheless, I hope and indeed expect that the fruitful cooperation which we have had with the Commission since the spring will continue when it comes to future reporting relating to the Development Fund, because such cooperation is needed to jointly solve problems in this area.
However, my report is still a very critical one.
It refers to 1999, and 1999 was the first budget year for which the new Commission was fully responsible.
However, full responsibility does not mean that the Commission can be blamed for the mistakes of the past.
We all know that reforms take time and we can see that the necessary measures have been initiated.
Despite that, I would like to briefly reiterate my criticism.
It is implementation that is at stake here. For example, there was a gap between commitments at EUR 2.69 billion and payments actually made in 1999 at EUR 1.27 billion.
Unfortunately, the same also applies to the implementation of the debt relief initiative for the poorest countries in the world.
I am, of course, aware that this reflects the general crisis in development aid, and that this situation is not unique to the Development Fund or to the Commission's work, and that all the Member States, together with the Commission and the Parliament, need to consider new approaches to development policy.
The problem is a failure of political will to provide aid on a generous scale, combined with a lack of instruments to effectively implement the available funds.
That is the problem in a nutshell.
In view of the lateness of the hour, I do not want to go into great detail, but I would like to emphasise that the Commission's approach to solving this problem is a step in the right direction.
It involves strengthening local delegations, providing them with better equipment and preparation, in short, making local delegations more competent.
However, I would also like to make an appeal to Parliament in this context.
In the Committee on Budgets, we had protracted debates on the need for higher staffing levels, particularly for delegations, and the Committee on Budgets put pressure on the Committee on Budgetary Control to make these posts available and not to play spurious political games with a view to making the Commission deliver reforms before we approve staff changes.
This is absurd of course, because these posts in local delegations are needed above all else so that reforms can be made in the first place.
The further efforts at reform described in the Commission's internal audit report are also important and need to be discussed in detail between the Commission and the Parliament.
I would like though to briefly mention a couple of expectations following on from the report of the Court of Auditors. I hope that in future these will be the hallmark of the discharge process and of cooperation between the Parliament and Commission.
One important point is that we need an ongoing assessment of progress in implementing measures to reform public administration in the ACP States.
We need to monitor progress achieved in the key sectors of health and education, using meaningful indicators such as the increase in the number of teachers or doctors, thus providing more qualitative checks instead of quantitative checks.
This would also mean the discharge process in the Parliament itself having to change.
In order words, we would have to shift our examination towards quality control and refrain from making a great hue and cry about points of detail. We would also have to carry out an annual audit of accounting and sound management of resources on the basis of samples and, lastly, apply clearly defined sanctions - such as the reduction or suspension of payments - in cases where the agreed reform measures are not complied with.
If we implement these measures together, then I believe that we will be jointly taking an important step towards enhancing the structure of development aid, and that we will be better placed to convince the EU's taxpayers and to secure approval for the necessary expenditure.
I say this because the situation prevailing since 11 September has demonstrated how important development aid is.
It will be a pivotal factor.
Furthermore, the EU has now become the world's largest provider of development aid.
That is why we urgently need this joint reform.
draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. (ES) Mr President, the difficult circumstances which have accompanied the management of the 1999 budget, of which we are all well aware, have especially affected funds for external relations and, even more, aid to third countries, including the European Development Fund.
For the Socialist Group, the good management of the European Development Fund is not only essential for reasons of correct and transparent accounting, but because this fund and all Community aid resources are essential if we are to contribute to reducing poverty, which is one of our priorities.
We are therefore closely monitoring the Commission' s action in this area.
The eventful journey of this report through the competent committees, leading to its approval, is a testimony to this interest.
Last year we made our 1998 discharge conditional upon the orientation of Community spending towards reducing poverty and we improved the structure of the budget in this respect, in order to reduce the risks of dispersal of aid funds.
This year we have delayed, on one occasion, the discharge, while awaiting a series of reports from the Court of Auditors.
We are now in a position to approve it, now that the Commission has adopted a series of measures to improve the effectiveness of aid, in particular the creation of Europe Aid, but at the same time certain data leads to some reservations: in 1999 the level of payments from the EDF was disappointing when compared to the level of commitment appropriations and payments achieved in previous years, as Mrs Rühle has said.
Initiatives such as the reduction of the debt of the least-developed countries are not being complied with in accordance with the commitments the Commission has made.
Contracts funded by the EDF essentially benefit companies in the Member States, to the detriment of local companies and organisations.
The Commission is not yet sufficiently directing its aid towards reducing poverty.
We want simplification of procedures, integration of the cycle of cooperation, transparency in management, assessment in such important sectors as health and education.
We will monitor compliance with the recommendations of the resolution we are debating today.
The Commission knows that it has the support of the Socialist Group in its efforts to improve the management of the EDF and the Socialist Group trusts that we will see these improvements during the coming financial years, so that we are able to discharge the budget with fewer problems and conditions than has been the case so far.
Thank you very much.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Rühle's report on the discharge for the European Development Funds presents an honest picture of the contradictions in our development policy.
On the one hand, there are complaints that we are not willing enough to make generous development aid available, and, on the other hand, it is undeniable that the money actually made available is often only disbursed very slowly.
There must be something wrong with a system under which at the end of 1999 resources of almost EUR 10 billion had been promised and made available without any specific deadlines, but had not been taken up.
The Commission will, of course, say that since then there have been signs of improvement here and there.
Nevertheless, it is a fact that we need to fundamentally review our approach.
The aid we offer through the Development Funds is reaching its limits, because it is geared towards supporting states that in some cases only exist on paper.
There is often a lack of an even semi-functioning public administration, there is a lack of democratic control of those in power, and many countries are in a state of open civil war or on the verge of it.
In a civil war situation, we first need to concentrate aid on conflict resolution and on humanitarian aid.
In other cases, we should concentrate our efforts to a greater extent than before on establishing properly functioning public administrations, which are a prerequisite for meaningfully applying aid from the EU or other donors in the international community.
Such administrations are also a prerequisite for ensuring that countries use their own tax revenue responsibly and in the interests of their citizens.
Our aid must therefore always be linked to reform programmes for public administration.
If these reforms make progress, aid is given, but if they do not progress or if there are setbacks we should not be afraid to turn off the tap.
I know that is a difficult thing to do, but it is precisely in such circumstances that the Commission needs to stand firm and adhere to its principles.
Finally, I would like to say one more thing about this discharge procedure. The discharge had to be postponed because the Commission did not initially provide the necessary information.
Furthermore, there was again the problem that certain confidential information was only forwarded to the committee chair and to the rapporteur.
As I have often said before, and I shall say it again now, this leads to two classes of Member of the European Parliament - those with and those without access to information.
The committee made it patently clear in its report that this situation should not be allowed to recur, and that the provisions of our Rules of Procedure in respect of the discharge procedure should be fully implemented in future.
In other words, all Members of this House should have access to all confidential information.
Mr President, the Commission is now to be granted discharge for 1999, but Parliament has, in actual fact, achieved a lot by postponing the discharge first time around.
The Commission has been pressed to take initiatives it would not otherwise have wished to take.
I think the rapporteur has delivered a splendid piece of work, but I also think the Commission deserves to be warmly congratulated when it makes progress - as, I believe, it has in fact done.
I would therefore recommend, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that we grant discharge for the development fund. At the same time, I want to assure the Commission that all the outstanding problems will be followed up in the discharge for the year 2000.
The Commission has carried out a major investigation of the counterpart funds and of the roles and responsibilities of the delegations.
An investigation has been carried out into whether the delegations have complied with their responsibilities, and it would appear that they have done so, for disciplinary enquiries are not to be carried out.
I can, of course, ask Mr Nielson if the Commission will confirm that disciplinary enquiries will not be carried out on the basis of its investigations.
I can also - perhaps rather teasingly - ask if the Commission will confirm this report, which will not be sent to Parliament.
The internal audit service has done good work from the start with its investigations of the counterpart funds.
It is a good report which is critical about the way in which the system operates.
The counterpart funds amount to direct budgetary support, and neither the Commission nor the delegations in the beneficiary countries have any direct control over the money.
The report emphasises that direct budgetary support is risky, irrespective of what is done.
Mr Nielson has said that that form of subsidy should nonetheless be maintained.
How, though, does he think that control over the funds can be improved?
The Commission must also be praised for sending this report to Parliament immediately.
It shows it has learned something from this whole course of events.
Discharge was postponed primarily because there were problems with the supply of information. Reports were sent to the wrong people, were seriously delayed or never arrived.
I think, however, that it is a good result we have achieved, and I therefore recommend discharge for the Commission.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to pay Mrs Rühle a compliment.
It is clear that her instincts were good when she postponed the discharge for the European Development Funds back in spring.
We in the Committee for Budgetary Control had at that point not received any substantial information at all on follow-up measures in connection with cases of fraud discovered in 1999.
However, we now very definitely know what we could only assume at that point, and that is that both the Commission and the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, have had to lower their sights.
For example, fraud in the health sector in the Ivory Coast was discovered in 1998/1999.
Medical equipment including disposable syringes and baby scales had for years been claimed at many times their actual value.
The loss was estimated at around EUR 27.4 million.
When this case came to light, the, at that time, newly appointed Commission said that this money would of course have to be repaid.
We now know that this money has not been returned to the European Development Fund.
According to the Commission the reason for this is that it was legally impossible to demand the money back!
I do not want to go into any further detail here, but this demonstrates how difficult it is to take corrective action once money has been transferred.
Furthermore, in the ACP States, OLAF does not have the same powers of control as it has in the EU Member States, not to mention the fact that it purely and simply does not have the staff to run a comprehensive anti-fraud operation out of Brussels.
It is therefore vital for us to exert pressure to ensure that there is a general improvement in the way public money is looked after in the recipient countries.
Countries that cannot protect their own tax revenue against fraud, corruption and waste are unlikely to be able to provide effective protection for EU funds.
However, for the Commission this also means that it should step up its presence in the recipient countries - and on this point I am in agreement with the rapporteur - but not only by increasing the number of officials in the delegations, but, also, by giving those local delegations more authority.
It should not, after all, be possible to circumvent local delegations in practice by coming to special arrangements direct with Brussels.
Once again, my heartfelt congratulations on your report, Mrs Rühle. We are very happy to vote for it.
Mr President, the closure and the reduction of the status and the staff of twenty-odd delegations in ACP countries, recently decided by the Commission, deals a harsh blow to the commitments to development given in the Cotonou Agreements.
If there is one lesson that we have learnt about monitoring the Community' s external action for development, it is that the key to its success is the existence of a strong, responsible, independent and credible presence in the recipient countries.
The arguments of budgetary neutrality used by the Commission are fallacious, because opening a delegation in countries such as Saudi Arabia cannot be compared with the overall costs of maintaining a European presence in those countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.
Furthermore this is not only a question of looking at the cost of a delegation, but of looking at the very real damage done to the effectiveness of public spending as a result of not monitoring such spending.
The European Union cannot do without an autonomous and meaningful policy for the less developed world and replace it with a form of regionalisation undertaken in agreement with some of the former colonial powers.
I hope that the Commission rethinks this course of action and treats the ACP countries and the management of the EDF with the importance that they deserve.
Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent and very serious work on this discharge exercise covering EDF 1999 which was the year in which this Commission took office.
This means that I feel especially responsible for the last four months of that year.
Mr Blak mentioned that Parliament has gained much by having this discharge delayed.
I think this is true, but it should be noted that the Commission feels equally pleased with the outcome.
This is like a good love story - it is always worth waiting for.
But it was wrong that the delay had to do specifically with information being held back in contradiction to the agreement between the Commission and Parliament.
The main reason for the delay was that the report from the internal auditor service was not finished and could not be finished because we, on both sides, found it necessary and a good idea to broaden its scope in order to get a serious and deep study of how to handle this method of development cooperation.
So we have solved problems that went beyond what is normally dealt with in the discharge process and this is what we can congratulate each other on tonight.
One remark to Mr Bösch concerning the Ivory Coast - we did get full recovery even though they had a military coup!
We grilled them.
We stuck to what I told Parliament: that we wanted to maintain a position of zero tolerance, and the new military dictators in the Ivory Coast accepted their obligations within the deadline.
We have not, in my time as Commissioner, experienced any case so far where we did not manage to get full recovery when the audit results indicated the need for that.
Our cooperation through the EDF has kept growing, while the support of other major donors for developing countries and especially for the least-developed countries has been declining.
The Funds constitute an increasingly important source of finance for these countries and so, of course, we owe it to them, and to our European taxpayers, to use these resources as effectively as possible.
By the same token, the Commission should be concerned to verify that the beneficiary countries are doing all they can to improve their own capacity for effective budgetary and financial management.
This has been a major theme of this discharge exercise, and it has succeeded in focusing attention on an important area of development cooperation.
The question of sound financial management of budgetary support is, I think, better understood, as a result of the work carried out by the Court of Auditors and the Commission' s internal audit service, in cooperation with the various Commission services responsible.
I do not see any need to amend the Cotonou Agreement to reflect this.
I am confident that there is a clear consensus between the Commission, the Court of Auditors and Parliament on the right way ahead, and in particular on the importance of budgetary support.
This is a key tool to enhance stability and economic governance.
By doing this in cooperation with other main donors and in a manner that emphasises the responsibility of the recipient government, we are playing a very important role.
I am deeply grateful to Parliament that this perspective has been understood for this budget period.
We need to continue to do this.
No other donor is able and willing to meet this challenge as we are.
Of course, we cannot turn a blind eye to the cases of corruption or of negligence in the management of public funds, and I can reassure you that we will continue this policy of zero tolerance towards fraud and corruption.
But we have to be aware, as you must, that the strengthening of financial control systems in these countries is a long-term process.
It has to be tackled with realism.
We have to make an assessment of the risks involved in each action that we consider for EDF finance, and go into action with a clear understanding of those risks.
It has to be based on a common approach with other donors.
An isolated approach by the Commission would be unrealistic.
It must rely on the development of internal accountability.
Cooperation with other donors in this field is better than ever.
We all need improvement, and this is definitely being pursued in good cooperation.
This covers the discharge for 1999, and the performance for 2000 is in several ways somewhat more encouraging.
One of the main objectives of the reform of the management of the Community' s external assistance programmes is, of course, drastically to reduce the gap between commitments and payments.
The Commission has been implementing measures since May of last year to tackle this problem.
For instance, we pressed ahead with the closure, wherever possible, of old and dormant commitments, and we proposed also the introduction of a so-called 'sunset clause' to limit the time during which funds allocated to an action can be used for contracts.
We, therefore, have reason to hope that the situation will gradually improve.
In relation to the slow rate of payments, the figures already available indicate that payments in 2000 increased from EUR 1.27 billion to EUR 1.55 billion.
We still have incredible inertia in the pipeline, in the way in which these figures move.
We have been increasing the total volume of what we do in this area and this is something that will gradually occur as a result of more and more activity year by year.
This is, of course, the challenge we are facing.
I have said, on several occasions, that the lack of comprehensive data about our operations is a real embarrassment.
We have made some progress towards more effective management information systems.
I know that Parliament, and particularly the Development Committee, is anxious to see us make progress in this area, and we are doing our best.
Nevertheless, there is still much to do and we are very conscious of the need to press on with reforming the management of our programmes.
In particular, we are concerned that the process of deconcentration, or delegating to delegations as I prefer to call it, should move ahead smoothly.
The Commission has been asking for additional staff, but the numbers required have been assessed on a very conservative basis and we need every single post.
I therefore hope that Parliament in its decisions on the budget for 2002 will support us in this effort.
It was encouraging to listen to Mr Casaca in this respect.
I thank you for your enthusiastic support and hope you can deliver.
We are determined that the deconcentration exercise should not end by simply exporting from Brussels to the delegations the problems caused by inadequate staffing.
This is serious.
Concern is expressed in the resolution about the percentage of EDF contracts going to companies from the ACP countries, and it requires the Commission to increase this from some 25% to 40% in five years.
The ACP countries win a much higher percentage of contracts under the EDF than from almost any other major donor.
This should not be forgotten.
ACP companies already benefit from a substantial preference margin in cases where offers are technically equivalent.
If it is to operate a transparent and fair tendering system, the Commission cannot envisage any kind of fixed quotas which would discriminate against European companies, and which would be contrary to WTO rules.
Nevertheless, we share the political intention of Parliament to maximise the benefits of our aid for local economies, particularly where there is a technically competent and well-structured private sector.
I would point to the new investment facility, part of the Cotonou Agreement, EUR 2.2 billion, which is architectured in order to stimulate the emergence of this activity in our partner countries.
This is a way in which they may improve their position in exactly this respect.
We have already identified this as an area where we should push forward.
I am anxious to reassure Parliament that the Commission is strengthening its monitoring procedures on the follow-up of audit.
This is an important part of the reform of the Commission' s financial management and control.
We also plan improvements to the presentation of the accounts, in response to the comments from the Court of Auditors.
We are ready to enter into a direct dialogue to find out how this is best done.
I will say a few words on the points in the resolution which refer to the transmission of confidential documents.
The respect of confidentiality and the application of correct transmission procedures remain crucial.
The 1999 discharge procedure showed that the framework agreement provides an effective and satisfactory framework for cooperation between the Commission and Parliament.
What we are discussing tonight has been following that set of rules.
I want to make that perfectly clear.
The 1999 discharge procedure was the first to which this framework agreement was applied.
The Commission sought to apply the agreement fully and loyally throughout that procedure.
In the Commission's view the framework agreement has proved to be an effective mechanism, one benefit being that it allows Parliament to receive confidential and similar information.
The understanding of the importance of development aid seems to be growing as we understand more and more about globalisation.
And in the light of recent events we have come to better understand the reality and urgency of interdependency in this world.
We cannot act alone.
The challenge of reducing poverty is one in which the whole international community is involved and we share with others the framework for providing aid and for assessing the results.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Mr President, I was rather surprised to hear the Commissioner state that we have recovered the money from the Ivory Coast.
I would be very grateful to the Commissioner if, within or without the framework agreement, he could inform me - in writing if necessary - where all this has been recorded, so that we can understand this.
Ladies and gentlemen, I can see that Mr Nielson is in agreement.
You will without doubt receive all these details as soon as possible.
Classification of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS)
The next item is the report (A5-0335/2001) by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment of a common classification of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) (COM(2001) 83 - C5-0065/2001 - 2001/0046(COD)).
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy is pleased with the initiative to lay down the classification of territorial units for statistics in a Regulation, thereby providing it with a legal basis.
Until now, because there has been no such legal basis, changes and updatings have been carried out by means of gentlemen's agreements between Member States and Eurostat.
I believe that statistics are neither neutral nor politically innocent.
I therefore believe that this proposed regulation is of great political importance, not only because it will be applied when determining which regions will receive Structural Funds, but also because it provides a certain vision of Europe, of its territorial reality, of its regional and provincial organisation and hence of its disparities and imbalances.

The proposal divides the territory of the States into statistical units organised hierarchically into three levels, and proposes criteria for the definition of these regions in the candidate countries, criteria which demand that they continue to be defined on the basis of territorial organisation and within the current demographic borders.
The Committee on Regional Policy shares the objectives which the Commission expresses in its proposed Regulation, but nevertheless considers that the classification obtained is not entirely suited to those objectives, which means that it is perceived by some citizens as an artificial division of European territory.
In fact, in the annex, the Commission restricts itself to presenting the existing administrative territorial units in each Member State, mixing them with others which do not have the same institutional character, which means that there is a clear lack of homogeneity.
The Committee on Regional Policy believes that the proposal should include a European approach which is capable of overcoming the framework of borders between States. In this respect, NUTS level 1 should take account of large territorial units which transcend these borders, which are intended to serve as a basis for the future planning of European territory.
Ladies and gentlemen, NUTS level 1 has clear shortcomings.
Only the regions of Germany and Belgium are considered units, while in other Member States, such as Spain, France or Italy, NUTS 1 level corresponds to enormous conglomerates or regions which are totally artificial and almost always arbitrary.
At the other extreme, the proposal names the Finnish Island of Aland as a NUTS 1 unit, despite the fact that its 25 000 inhabitants are way below the minimum of 3 million required for that demographic bracket.
I still believe that the Commission' s proposal should have been more daring, more coherent and, perhaps, if you will allow me, more European.
There are even more disparities in level 3, where a single Member State, Germany, has more units than eight Member States put together: France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg.
In relation to the surface area of the territorial units, the imbalance is also evident, since in the proposal the prevailing criterion is population rather than geographical size.
The Committee on Regional Policy urges the Commission and the Member States to work towards the creation of NUTS level 4 and even NUTS level 5, which would represent local bodies.
The Committee on Regional Policy is presenting Parliament with eleven amendments to this proposal.
I must point out that this report was approved in committee by 43 votes in favour and one abstention.
As rapporteur, I support these amendments and reject the other amendments presented in Parliament, which were rejected in committee.
I believe that the report approved by the Committee on Regional Policy should be accepted by Council and the Commission.
Its acceptance could prevent a second reading and a conciliation procedure and would allow the Regulation to enter into force on 1 January 2002.
If that is the case, we should be pleased that we have produced a legal text providing the basis for determining the territorial units necessary for gathering statistical information in this great Europe of the future.
Let us not fall into the trap of statistics being the art of indicating that two people have eaten well, when, in fact, one of them has eaten two chickens and the other has eaten none.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the classification of territorial units for statistics is not a formality, as might appear at first sight, it is not a technical debate about statistical terms, it is a material question because adopting any classification has direct repercussions on how the development of each territorial unit is supported.
With the forthcoming enlargement, or to be more precise, enlargements, given that candidate countries will integrate in groups, we need to move towards objective criteria for classifying territorial units, so that new members know the rules of play.
The simplest way would be to adopt fully unified criteria for each classification level and for all the Member States.
However, the many and varied specific characteristics of the countries in the Union make this idea unfeasible and impracticable.
So we must agree with the rapporteur and endorse her satisfaction with the Commission initiative which, with the proposed regulation, creates the legal basis for classifying territorial units for statistics.
We should also congratulate the rapporteur who, with her sense of moderation and what I would call female perspicacity, has proposed and accepted feasible improvements to the Commission opinion in order to achieve a better approach to the basic objective, which cannot be but to formulate truly comparable territorial units, in every sense of the word, so that we can establish a universal European statistics system.
Given past injustices, the reasonable doubts of European citizens should not be brushed aside with replies along the lines of "this area is supported, even though it is better off than yours because it is a NUTS II territorial unit, whereas yours isn't".
Rationalisation at all operational levels in the Union should be our basic and fixed aspiration.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, for this excellent report.
She has raised important questions and also taken the proposals of others into account.
Our group supports the Commission' s proposal and, furthermore, the rapporteur' s view regarding the creation of a proper legal basis for verifying nomenclature.
The issue is also a timely one, as the applicant countries are receiving guidelines for verifying territorial classification in their own countries.
With the present NUTS classification system one problem is that classifications by country have shaped themselves according to each country' s own needs and traditions.
One cause for criticism is the fact that the land area of regions has not been used as a basis for statistics.
Units vary in size and, for example, a low population density or gradual depopulation are overlooked.
The aims of the regulation regarding clear rules, comparability and impartiality deserve support.
It is also important to determine rules for dealing with amendments and to ensure that the NUTS classification does not change too often.
We would ask you to support our group' s amendment, whereby islands and the outermost regions are added to the Subparagraph of Article 3 (4) in order to avoid unnecessary reclassification.
Our group stresses the importance of also having flexibility in classification so that administrative factors and, for example, geographical, social and economic circumstances will be taken into consideration as appropriate.
Our group supports the rapporteur' s opinion that the Commission should investigate the inclusion of a new level NUTS 4 in the regulation.
The goal relating to the comparative classification of territories will be difficult to achieve, and will take time.
It is essential, however, that we establish a fair classification, which will help to allocate the right actions to the right areas.
Mr President, it is a great pity that Mr Barnier is not here himself, because the NUTS classification is not just a purely technical or statistical question, it is one of the most important political issues for our future cohesion policy.
It is about whom will receive European funding in future, how much they will receive, and about who decides how it will be spent.
These are pivotal issues for the future of the European Union and of the cohesion policy, and that is why this subject, which we are now discussing at the midnight hour, is more important than has been evident hitherto.
The Commission has always adhered purely to statistical criteria for the classification of territorial units and has not taken such political issues into account.
So there was ultimately always a tendency to distribute resources from the structural funds using a scattergun approach, rather than concentrating these resources in any efficient way on the regions in greatest need.
Looking at the candidate countries, the Objective 1 areas have been extended to include high-income regions and centres such as Warsaw and Riga, and these regions receive just as much by way of funding as the poorest regions of the enlarged European Union, Latgale and Masuria.
I am sure that cannot be right.
This runs counter to a credible cohesion policy and I regard it as being totally absurd!
That is why I would like to ask whether the same agency that grants the authority aid funding should also be the control agency.
As I see it, the proposal before us does not adopt a bottom-up approach.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard the proposal for a regulation on the establishment of a common classification of Territorial Units for Statistics, NUTS, as being sensible and clear in terms of both statistics and administration.
However, we must ensure that any amendment to the classification also requires the prior approval of the Member States.
We must also ensure that the definition of employment market regions under the 'shared-task' mechanism can also deviate from NUTS level III in future.
The two-year period provided for between an amendment to NUTS being accepted and coming into force should either be significantly reduced or else totally dropped, as Commission financial support for the Member States can depend on the regional structure.
Otherwise, I am completely satisfied with the Commission proposal, and would in fact be happier without the rapporteur's amendments that were adopted by a majority of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
Although I said 'by a majority' , they were in fact adopted unanimously with one abstention, and that abstention was mine.
I voted against certain amendments in committee.
This was because the report repeatedly referred to the adoption of additional criteria for the definition of regions as an objective.
I regard that as a problem, as taking account of, say, economic, geographical and social criteria in the case of non-administrative units will lead to a blurring of these clear criteria.
I believe that a key criterion for the definition of regions should be the number of people living in a region, as in the final analysis they are affected by any decisions regarding the NUTS classification.
When the rapporteur says in one recital that there should be at least three hierarchical levels, the use of that little phrase 'at least' implies that further levels ought to be created for classifying territorial units.
However, it needs to be borne in mind that the introduction of new statistics for the areas affected would involve a significant additional administrative burden, something that I believe should if anything be limited.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Miguélez and everyone who has spoken in this debate.
I would like to start by clarifying two points that seem essential to me.
It is up to you to interpret whether statistical classification can have a political impact or not; but I can assure you that that is not the objective of this document, nor was it the Commission' s intention.
The document is based on a Eurostat proposal which intends to achieve the most equitable treatment possible for all the countries and regions of the European Union.
Nor does this document in any way prejudice regional policy: we do not know who will be objective 1, who will be objective 2 or whether the current regional policy system will be the same in the future.
We are talking about statistics here; and we are talking about making the statistics better and as equitable as possible for all the countries of the Union.
What is our intention?
Our intention is that a practice we have been applying up until now should become a rule.
And we want to do this because it seems essential to us to give a legal character to something which so far has been a consensus between the Member States and the Commission.
But it also seems essential to us as a means of establishing principles for enlargement and in order to continue applying the same criteria that have been applied up to this point.
Until now, the NUTS had no legal basis, now they are acquiring it: this is the objective of the present regulation.
What criteria have we used for the definition of the NUTS?
Our document is essentially based on three principles.
The first is that the NUTS are legislative regions; we have therefore tried to define their territory in accordance with existing legislative political definitions: a good definition, recognised by the Member States, of units which in many cases already have governmental structures and comparable statistics, which makes them sufficiently reliable.
The second principle is that we propose three hierarchical levels of NUTS.
In your amendments you have gone further and asked for at least three levels.
With our current room for manoeuvre, from the point of view of producing statistics, to work with more than three levels would create financial problems for Eurostat.
This is one reason, but, furthermore, we believe that three levels will provide us with sufficient and valid information.
The third principle is to try to make the regional statistics comparable.
This is why the size of the NUTS has to be as homogenous as possible.
But we are also aware that there are historic realities and legal situations in each of the countries which mean that this principle cannot be applied in an automatic or mechanical way, and that specific situations have to be taken into account.
There is a consensus between Member States that these principles we have been using until now should also form the ideas behind the new regulation, as I have already mentioned, not only for application in our countries as they stand, but also in the countries which are going to join us in the coming years.
That is why the regulation responds to a series of objectives which you have been able to debate in depth and for which you have made some corrections.
We are heading towards having NUTS that are classified in accordance with the current regional systems, because we believe that this is the most effective instrument we have today for the collection, calculation and diffusion of regional statistics.
Furthermore, in the regulation we set criteria for defining regions in such a way that the candidate countries will have guidelines for regional classification within their own territory. This objective is essential at this time.
I would also like to stress the need for statistics to be as comparable and as impartial as possible.
These statistics must not be produced and used for political ends, whatever they may be.
It would be very difficult to establish political interests which undoubtedly would lead us to clear contradictions.
This issue is essential for the Union' s regional policy, but, as I said before, statistical classification must not prejudice the nature of the Union' s future regional policy.
We intend to create clear rules for future modifications to the classification of NUTS because this will prevent future disputes, which have arisen in the past.
Modifications are inevitable.
We cannot speak of absolutely permanent situations, but NUTS must not be modified too often and of course we must have a system which is based on certain rules and certain pre-established principles.
We therefore believe it to be appropriate that modifications would not take place within a time period of three years, or else we will be faced with monitoring problems.
The regulation, as it is drawn up, allows us to move forward and improve on what we have at the moment.
You have contributed 11 amendments which, in our opinion, help to clarify and improve the regulation.
The Commission can therefore accept the 11 amendments presented by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
I would like to end by stressing that the NUTS Regulation will be an important instrument for achieving comparable and impartial regional statistics in the European Union, on which we will be able to base the regional policy which we will decide on, politically, at the appropriate time.
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.09 p.m.)
Madam President, I want to raise an issue on the floor of the House which I am sure will be welcomed.
I do so as the Labour Party spokesperson on Northern Ireland.
The House would surely like to welcome the news on the peace process in Northern Ireland and the decommissioning of weapons.
It serves as an example of what can be achieved through peaceful negotiation.
Tribute must be given to those involved in the difficult times of the peace process and the ongoing negotiations.
Mention must be made at the determination of those involved, including David Trimble, and not least a Member of this House, John Hume, who has fought for peace for over three decades.
Mr Cashman, I am even more pleased to hear this good news because I was on an official visit to Ireland last week, and, naturally, we were all waiting for this announcement.
Thank you for your comments.
Madam President, as you were informed earlier this week, I was in Scotland protesting against the Trident nuclear submarine base there and I was arrested.
What is the situation concerning our immunity in other Member States?
I understood that we could not be arrested in such circumstances.
I have nothing against the Scottish Police.
They were extremely courteous.
They were aware of the concept of peaceful demonstration.
Maybe they should train the police in places like Genoa and show them how to react to peaceful protests.
What is the situation regarding our immunity?
I was not breaking the peace, but trying to keep the peace by helping to rid the world of nuclear weapons.
Secondly, in relation to my immunity: Does that not count when I am in another country?
Mrs McKenna, I had, of course, been informed of the situation that you were in and I am pleased to see that you are back with us.
We shall thoroughly examine the issue regarding protocol.
I shall of course take the appropriate steps to ensure that Members are properly protected, if this is necessary.
Madam President, after that intervention inspired by naked self-interest, may I come back to more important matters of the day.
I would like to support my colleague, Mr Cashman, and in particular point out that this Parliament has been a very active supporter of the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland.
It has been a long, and at times faltering, road to achieving peace and no one knows that better than our own Nobel Peace Prizewinner, John Hume.
I grew up in Northern Ireland in the shadow of violence, terrorism and intimidation.
We are now witnessing another milestone in the return to peace for future generations.
May I ask you therefore to write on behalf of the European Parliament to all those involved and congratulate them on this major initiative?
I would also hope that the Belgium presidency would do the same on behalf of the Council for the 15 Member States.
Mrs McCarthy, I shall certainly do what you ask.
I can tell you that all those I met were more than aware of the European Parliament' s long-standing contribution to the peace process in Northern Ireland.
Madam President, I do not wish to delay proceedings, but just to follow up on the point, which has been made on a number of occasions, about parliamentary immunity.
I could be wrong, but my understanding is that the purpose of parliamentary immunity for Members of Parliament acting in the Parliament - not outside the Parliament - is to allow you to represent the people who elected you.
It is not so that you can necessarily represent your own views in whatever manner you choose.
In other words, when you are outside this House, you are just the same as anyone else.
You are on your own.
Mr Beazley, questions of immunity are always very delicate, as you know, and Mr Duff has been appointed to draft a report on the issue.
I suggest that he also take account of all the very interesting points that you have both brought up, so that the document written on this is as comprehensive as possible.
I would like to thank Mr Duff for doing this.
Madam President, as an Italian, I would like to thank Mrs McKenna for urging the Italian police to follow the example of the Scottish police.
I would also like to express my sorrow at her unfortunate experience and my appreciation of her commitment to social concerns.
I would like to thank her on behalf of the Italian police, which, however, I feel is no worse than any other police force in Europe.
In all probability, the Scottish police were polite and courteous because, if one police force should imitate another, it may be that protesters should imitate other protesters too. What I mean is the Scottish police were polite and courteous because the protesters who were with Mrs McKenna did not follow the example of the protesters in Genoa.
Thank you, Mr Santini.
European Council meeting (Ghent, 19 October 2001)
The next item is the European Council report and the Commission statement on the meeting of 19 October 2001 in Ghent.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, our group supports the Ghent statement on terrorism, but, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we also say that words must now be backed up by deeds.
It is not acceptable that this is the second time that the Heads of State and Government have made recommendations which are then not promptly put into effect by the Ministers of the Interior and of Justice.
We call upon the Ministers of the Interior and of Justice to act with speed.
We also say, above all, that cooperation merely between States cannot continue as at present.
Important issues of home affairs and justice policy must also be dealt with on the basis of Community law, and the Commission must have a central role in observing the situation and implementing Community law.
Continuity is not achieved by the Presidency of the Council rotating every six months.
Continuity must also be ensured by the European Commission and the European institutions.
I ask you also, in your capacity as Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Belgium, to resolve the issue of the security of the European institutions, including the European Parliament in Brussels, with a solution that will be satisfactory both in principle and in practice.
We have to make Europe's voice heard more.
It was surely right for prominent individuals from the European Union to go to visit the American President, but I find it no longer acceptable that, for example, the situation arises where the American Secretary of State appears before the television cameras with three prominent Europeans alongside him.
We will have to learn lessons for the future from this; a crisis is always also an opportunity. We need one European face to represent us to the world!
(Applause)
We now have a coalition against terrorism.
Our group supports it unreservedly.
We now, though, also need a coalition to rebuild Afghanistan.
I welcome the position you have taken on this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
Afghanistan has been suffering for twenty years.
We must make an effort as a Community, also at an international level, to give Afghanistan a good future.
You and the President of the Commission have spoken rightly about the Middle East.
Our group rejects the deliberate killing of people, be it in Palestine or in Israel.
We call on the parties involved to at last give a signal for peace.
We want there to be cooperation, we want there to be a Palestinian state and we want Israel to be able to live within recognised and secure borders.
We urge all those involved to take a step away from the policy of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and towards one of cooperation, peace and mutual understanding.
(Applause)
We see the Mediterranean dialogue as an important challenge.
It is for that reason that we have proposed the Euro-Mediterranean Meeting in Brussels on 8 November.
I wish to thank Mrs Fontaine for promptly implementing our joint decision in the Conference of Presidents.
We hope that this will send a message about cooperation with the Arab and Islamic world.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are in broad agreement with you as regards Laeken, but please ensure that the Convention does not only have the task of enumerating options.
Its task will be, rather, to present a majority proposal.
There may of course also be a minority vote.
This must not lead to negotiations without binding effect.
That is not what we expect of the Convention, but rather a proposal which can then go to the Heads of State and Government for discussion.
We also expect this Convention not to have too large a bureau.
It is crucial that five persons should be represented in it: the chairman/chairwoman and the representatives of the four institutions involved.
This body must exercise real leadership, taking the Convention into a better future.
We would like to see this Convention's work timetabled in such a way that it can conclude a Treaty in 2003 under the Italian Presidency, a Treaty that we hope will lead to the fundamental treaty of which you have spoken.
Let me make another observation, a very practical one. In Ghent, you discussed transfers between bank accounts in different countries of the European Union, a question which one might think not to be so important.
Our Parliament, though, has put forward a proposal by means of Mrs Peijs' report.
We have made clear that the high costs incurred in bank transfers are not acceptable.
I think that the Heads of State and Government have done the right thing in taking this issue on board.
Please permit me one final observation: there has been a certain amount of friction between the Presidency of the Council and the Commission, which is very regrettable in view of the Presidency of the Council being held by Belgium.
At issue was our common presentation of ourselves to the public - who said what, and when.
There was a certain annoyance because three Member States had met together.
I want neither to play that up nor to ignore it.
I would, though, like to point out to all the European institutions that our Europe is so complicated that it must not be a Europe of vanities or a Europe of dominance, but all the institutions must meet each other halfway.
It is important that we understand each other and work together, for our common European future is at stake.
I hope that the crisis in which the world currently finds itself will bring the European institutions together and lead them to common action for Europe.
(Applause)
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, following the European Council in Ghent, my group feels both hope and concern.
Hope, because in Northern Ireland arms are being entombed in concrete, and concern, because we are facing a long fight against global terrorism, which we must pursue with conviction, perseverance and courage.
This fight is not limited to what appears in the television pictures, whether they be from Al Jazeera or from CNN.
We must deal with the response measures authorised by the United Nations, but we must also make a significant effort in the humanitarian field and in terms of reconstruction and stabilisation, both in Afghanistan and in many other parts of the world.
The European Union can play an important role in this context.
With regard to what the President-in-Office of the Council said about the Ghent meeting, I would like to point out that in Helsinki the European Council decided to create a rapid intervention force which is still not operational.
The prior meeting of certain Member States was inappropriate.
I also believe - and I address this to both the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission - that we must show unity at all times and it is highly significant that, after a European Council, the President of the Commission should appear shoulder to shoulder with the President-in-Office of the Council to announce the decisions adopted.
With regard to the relationship between the European Council and the specific Councils, I would point out that the European Parliament is making an effort to speed up the negotiation of the measures you have proposed, but this is not being treated in a corresponding fashion by the Justice and Home Affairs Council.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would recommend that, before the meeting of the European Council in Laeken, you read in detail the report by my group colleague, Mr Poos, who is the person with the most historical experience of the Council.
It may help you to present interesting proposals.
With regard to our relations with the Islamic countries and the Arab world, we believe that the forum we are going to relaunch at the beginning of November may be positive.
My political family is also trying to re-establish links and the new tour of the Middle East which you have announced is very important, with an active approach by the Union to the resolution of this absolutely key conflict.
As for the economy, please allow me to make a brief point: inflation is decreasing, there are margins, but the European Union' s policy must be active and anti-cyclic, and we still have a Central Bank which takes decisions and a Council which makes recommendations.
The Union needs economic leadership.
And since you have said that you are going to the University of Ghent for a debate on globalisation, I would also ask you to take the European Parliament' s report on the reform of the international financial system.
With regard to the Tobin tax, your political friends have voted against what was proposed in ECOFIN and what my group presented as an amendment.
As for the future of Europe, I would like to point out that the Convention is not a war of opposing positions, but must be a joint effort.
We are making progress and you are gradually retracting, and that is not good.
I am grateful that the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the rapporteurs have been convened.
On behalf of my group, I can tell you that we have two concerns: one, that there should be balanced representation between European parliamentarians and those of the Member States, both in the Convention and in the Presidency; secondly, that the Convention should make a difference and not just be a talking shop or a debating club, and should make coherent proposals.
Lastly, the proposals should lead to a decision by the Intergovernmental Conference before the 2004 elections in order to honour our commitments in the field of enlargement.
And in relation to enlargement, I must say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council - and here there have also been some interpretation problems - that the final exam will be taken at the end of 2002.
I am pleased that you were in Poland yesterday.
I was there on Saturday and I would like to say that I am surprised that the conservatives of the Union are beginning to say that Poland is becoming a problem because a party of the Left has won.
Poland was a much bigger problem before, because it did not have a solvent government and I believe that, although there always has to be a degree of political competition, we must support Poland, which now has a strong government with a clear desire to take part in the future of Europe.
Madam President, I should like to begin - as other colleagues have done today - with a reference to the milestone event in Northern Ireland.
The verified decommissioning of IRA weapons has been a necessary and required act for a considerable period of time.
It was long overdue, but now that it has happened, it is hugely welcome.
Particularly since 11 September it has been increasingly inevitable that such an act should take place.
I hope it represents a new dawn, a rebirth, a renaissance for the peace process in Northern Ireland and that all the political actors will now seize this moment to ground and root the peace in the institutions of that agreement.
I add my voice to those who have asked all the institutions today, in the clearest terms, to welcome what has happened on behalf of the European Union.
I want to say to Prime Minister Verhofstadt, with regard to the Ghent Council, that my group totally supports the clearest and most unequivocal assurances you have given of total solidarity with the United States.
That is an important act of solidarity, and an important point of departure.
I reiterate, for my group, that we totally support this.
If I do not dwell on this, it is simply because there are one or two questions I should like to raise with you, Mr President-in-Office.
In particular, we have had rather a long debate about the potential humanitarian crisis.
Clearly for areas within control of the Taliban, we cannot blame the world community for Taliban unwillingness to engage with the United Nations, NGOs and others.
But I would like to know what specific initiatives we, as the European Union, with our commitment of resources in this area, are now taking to urge Pakistan to open more space for refugees.
I appreciate the enormous difficulties.
I appreciate they already have two million or more Afghanis within their territory, but can we not, with our financial and organisational capacity, reassure those authorities that if the borders are opened to cope with this crisis they will not be left alone or have to pick up the tab on their own?
I should like to turn to the question of the role of the Council of Ministers in following up on the action plan to fight terrorism.
In particular, I note the strategic leadership which you offered through the Council at the extraordinary meeting on 21 September.
There you made a clear plea to the institutions to seize that moment and act.
Here I congratulate the Commission for taking the European Council at its word and bringing forward with extraordinary speed a comprehensive measure to freeze the assets of terrorist organisations.
I can tell you in this Parliament that within 24 hours of receiving that, and with the proviso that we should review it in the lifetime of this Parliament, we too seized the moment.
That had no precedent ever in European law making.
It was with some regret then that one noticed that, if there was a delay, it was among your 'line managers' from the European Council down to the Council of Ministers.
I have a number of questions: What is the Council doing on the freezing of assets?
But I have an important question around it. Can you explain to me, Prime Minister, what does this mean about the quality of governance in the European Union?
After all, the Council is there to give a strategic lead.
You gave it, the Commission followed; this House followed.
The question is: Why did the Council of Ministers not follow with the same alacrity?
I would like to pose one other question in relation to the Convention.
The Prime Minister has explained to us that the candidate states will participate.
I very much welcome that.
I ask the Prime Minister to clarify, in the light of the agreement at Helsinki, that all candidate countries will be treated on an equal basis.
Does that invitation extend to Turkey?
It is important that Turkey should be included, based on the principles clarified at Helsinki.
I know it is not a negotiating state, but Helsinki established a clear principle of equality of treatment for candidate states.
To summarise: What will we do with Pakistan and humanitarian aid?
What does the example of the freezing of assets tell us about the rather dysfunctional quality of governance?
Will Turkey be a participant in the process?
Finally, I am glad to see that the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office, today at least, are sharing a platform in the European Parliament.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, we know that when all European Councils draw to a close, they either give us grounds for satisfaction or grounds for disappointment.
One of the grounds for satisfaction is always the number of well-intentioned declarations, and one of the grounds for disappointment is usually the way these are implemented.
I shall restrict my comments to the chapter on the follow-up to the 11 September attacks and the fight against terrorism and I would like to give my views on this on behalf of my group.
We welcome the statement that humanitarian aid for Afghanistan and neighbouring countries is an absolute priority, but unfortunately, we do not welcome the specific actions taken.
If we want to take specific action and provide vital and essential food aid to the civilian population at risk, we must respond to the appeals by numerous key figures and NGOs and suspend the bombings.
We have had enough indications and warnings, spelling out that a humanitarian catastrophe is imminent, as winter in Afghanistan is approaching, which is usually extremely harsh.
We now know that the civilian population is paying a high price for the war, and the Council, in declaring its staunchest support for the military operations, is turning a blind eye to this situation.
The pre-summit meeting between the Heads of State and Government in Ghent, other than the fact that, to my mind, it is a failure compared to the real summit, demonstrated that the Heads of State and Government give military cooperation with the United States priority over a concerted political approach at European Union level. It also relegates the humanitarian, diplomatic and all other types of initiatives to the background.
With regard to the commitment to fight against terrorism and to protect the population against these acts of terrorism, it goes without saying that the commitment made by the Council is to be welcomed, but an unambiguous definition of terrorism is clearly needed as far as legislative initiatives are concerned in order to avoid any confusion and the criminalisation of any anti-establishment behaviour or activities, which are, however, political in nature and legitimate nonetheless.
Our group has a number of concerns regarding the declaration in which the European Union states that it is willing to undertake reciprocal initiatives with the United States, particularly to facilitate judicial assistance and extradition.
Regarding extradition, we are aware that the death penalty is still in force in the United States and therefore this poses a huge problem for the European Union.
Regarding judicial assistance, we are concerned about ensuring that civil liberties are protected and that personal data protection is not diminished as a result of this cooperation with the United States.
One of the important chapters concerns the protection of the population, and we welcome the joint efforts made with regard to non-proliferation and export controls on weapons and chemical, bacteriological and nuclear substances capable of being used for terrorist purposes.
Therefore, intensifying our joint efforts is a very positive move, but we may wonder why the important question of industrial activities has not been mentioned at all, particularly with regard to nuclear power stations and re-processing plants, where large quantities of radioactive and fissile substances are stored, which could cause an ecological and social catastrophe in the event of an aircraft crash, intentional or otherwise.
The Council statement does not contain a single reference to this issue, and I think that this is a serious oversight.
To sum up, Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, I think that it is true to say that we are particularly disappointed by the outcome of this Summit.
I do not wish to have to relive this disappointment at the Laeken Summit, and I am pleased to note that Mr Verhofstadt is determined to give the European Union a new role and to open up genuine dialogue on a topic that has been slightly overworked in recent weeks, in other words, globalisation.
I am pleased that he has changed the vocabulary he was using to refer to this matter, since he has rejected the term 'anti-globalisation,' which was essentially inappropriate.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, the four weeks that passed between the Extraordinary European Council of 21 September and the Ghent Summit of 19 October were filled with events of strategic importance.
In what ways did the Fifteen analyse these events?
In the meantime, the targeted response, for which the Member States had already declared their support the month before, has escalated into real war, causing wide-spread devastation, civilian casualties and distraught people heading for the borders.
On numerous occasions, targets have been missed, with refugee centres, hospitals, residential areas and even Northern Alliance positions being mistakenly attacked.
The ultimate goal of these operations, which are being stepped up, is becoming increasingly blurred as each day goes by and their vague strategy is startling.
There are growing protests...there is mounting criticism...the feeling of unease is spreading, including amongst fervent supporters and key allies of a consistent fight against terrorism.
What is our objective?
Do we sincerely believe that this is the way to win the necessary fight to close down these criminal networks and deprive them of their fertile breeding ground?
How does the European Council view this development, that is worrying to say the least, particularly in the wake of the announcement that American soldiers will soon be deployed on Afghan territory, and even more so because both Ramadan and winter are almost upon us?
Well, the European Council - and I quote - 'confirms its staunchest support for the military operations [...] and [...] notes that these targeted actions are in accordance with the conclusions of the Extraordinary European Council meeting on 21 September 2001.'
In some ways, therefore, there is nothing new in this statement...I am saddened and concerned by this attitude, as it almost puts Europe out of the running altogether, at a time when much is expected of Europe, of a political Europe, not of a military Europe, and of a Europe which, admittedly, has expressed solidarity with the United States in tracking down these terrorist networks, but failed, however, to provide unconditional support for the unilateral choices made by those in Washington.
In the weeks before the tragic events of 11 September, the European Union had, in fact, begun to play a role on the international stage, in the Middle East, in Macedonia, at the Durban conference on racism, and the EU knew how to make a mark on events.
This was also true on the day after the attacks, when Europe supported the most realistic and responsible movement within the Bush Administration, helping to do away with the worrying concept of a crusade in order to set up a global coalition on an unprecedented scale.
Unfortunately, since military operations got underway, the European Union has been acting as if it were paralysed.
The new global situation means proper intervention by Europe is more pressing than ever on some crucial issues that are at the heart of the current world crisis, and most importantly, on the Middle East question.
Mr Verhofstadt briefly touched upon this point and Mr Prodi came back to the issue: the European Council statement rightly reiterates that the UN resolutions must be respected in order to find a lasting solution to this conflict; the US leaders themselves now seem to agree that Mr Sharon' s policy is feeding the spiral of violence and is a fundamental barrier to peace.
Now then is the time for straight talking before things once again spiral out of control and thus give another chance to those who fish in troubled waters.
No one is better placed than Europe to give fresh hope to the forces of peace in the region.
I believe that this should now be our overriding ambition.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, President Prodi, firstly, I would like to express my very sincere thanks for the comments that have been made by colleagues here this morning and by you, Madam President and President Prodi on the good news from Ireland on the decommissioning of arms.
I very much want to put on record once again the important part Parliament and the Commission played in helping the peace process at a time when this help was very much needed.
We have had a dramatic breakthrough in the last 24 hours, but let nobody here take it for granted that the road to peace - a just and lasting peace - is going to be easy.
Of course, the great majority of people on the island of Ireland are genuinely in search of this just and lasting peace, but, regrettably, a small minority will do their best to try and derail the process.
We must all be on the watch for that.
I very much welcome the fact that the European Union leaders unequivocally stated their full support for the action that has been taken in the fight against terrorism in all its aspects and reaffirmed their solidarity with the American government.
They have agreed that the fight against terrorism must continue within a United Nations framework.
I believe that the United Nations has a very important and leading role to play in this regard.
Present and future actions in the fight against international terrorism should and must emanate from the membership of the United Nations.
We are all concerned that civilian populations must be shielded from the attacks which are taking place in Afghanistan at this time and, in a war situation, there is nothing more sickening than one hearing commentators refer to civilian deaths as 'collateral damage'.
We are dealing with lives here and human lives must always be protected.
Humanitarian aid for the Afghan people must be a priority and such aid must cover the needs of the Afghan population and Afghan refugees, EU governments are fully committed to ensuring that such aid reaches these people in need.
We want to ensure that this is done.
Winter is due to start very shortly in Afghanistan, and these winters are exceptionally cold and difficult.
I believe that the international community, including the European Union and the United Nations, must estimate the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people over the next few months and ensure that all the necessary humanitarian aid is delivered.
We must also, remember that the war against terrorism is being fought on many different fronts.
Within the Union, there must be formal adoption of the EU directive on money laundering.
We must be able to confiscate the financial proceeds of terrorism so as to help cut off the money supply which is the financial oxygen for its evil operations.
We can confiscate the financial proceeds of drug barons in Europe and we must be able to extend these powers of confiscation to other financial proceeds of crime.
There must be a speedy ratification by the Union's Member States of the United Nations Convention for the suppressing of the financing of terrorism.
EU governments at Ghent supported the implementation of a common European arrest warrant, and our EU Justice Ministers are due to meet on 7 December 2001 to put in place the final terms governing the operation of this warrant.
It is very important, in my view, that there is a clear definition of terrorist acts, as a national cannot and should not be extradited from one country in Europe to another unless the specified crime is a crime in his or her host Member State.
Finally, we live in challenging and uncertain times and the political situation in the Middle East is very volatile.
The present instability and violence cannot and must not continue indefinitely.
I believe that the Israeli troops must withdraw from the territories of the Palestinian Authority.
I would appeal to the Israeli and Palestinian authorities to do everything possible to negotiate a settlement based on the recommendations of the Mitchell report.
Madam President, Prime Minister and President of the Commission, at the Ghent Summit we saw the trinity, or 'dictorium' , of the big three countries make an appearance.
The preliminary meeting between Great Britain, France and Germany suggests a model that is as far from the federalists' vision, or illusion, of a democratic federal State as it is from the Eurosceptics' more realistic desire for a Europe of democracies.
Cooperation between the big three is engaged in on an intergovernmental basis, behind closed doors and without democratic control.
In this way, the big three decide what the others are to think.
For the small countries, intergovernmental cooperation between the big countries may come across as supranational dictates.
The summits are also conducted behind closed doors and without democratic control.
European integration is now modelled on the way in which private holding companies operate.
A minority of the largest shareholders is able to make decisions on behalf of the majority.
Cooperation can thus be intergovernmental and supranational at one and the same time and combine the defects of these arrangements with the maximum lack of openness, democracy and proximity to the people.
The summits must be transformed into well-prepared meetings in which small and large countries and all parliaments have an equal part to play in the preparations.
Summits must be opened up to elected representatives so that representatives of the national parliaments are able to exercise democratic control by being present there.
Summits should also be opened up to the press whenever prime ministers discuss legislation and other issues which, in our Member States, are dealt with openly.
Mr Verhofstadt is still a young prime minister from a country that has traditionally opposed the big countries' dictatorial way of thinking.
Have nothing to do with this, Prime Minister!
Invite elected representatives to the next summit in Laeken.
Do not make a decision to begin a constitutional process without its first having been discussed with the electorate in our countries.
Let the next treaty be formulated through the input of grassroots contributions instead of its coming like a thief in the night to limit our democracy.
Make sure, too, that the 49% of the electorate that voted against Maastricht in France and the majority of the electorate who recently voted 'no' in Ireland and Denmark can feel they are properly represented in the forthcoming convention.
Promise, above all, that the next treaty will be subject to referendums in all the countries. In that way, you will be obliged to design a treaty that can be adopted, that is to say, a treaty characterised by openness, democracy and proximity to the people.
President of the Commission, I am speaking on behalf of the European radical Members of the Bonino List.
We welcome the European government' s support of the United States institutions, although we hope that they will manage to continue to resist the anti-American, anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist instincts which are so powerful within the political groupings in Europe. However, we would criticise the delays in presenting a humanitarian aid plan and its lack of practical content in the face of a potential humanitarian disaster.
On a more general note, it is not right to focus on the difficult nature of the European Union' s political role without addressing the issue of the democratic nature of the institutions themselves.
We have talked about how important it is for the Fifteen to act in unity and with all speed and to assume a common position.
In our opinion, unity between the Fifteen is valuable when it is achieved through public - and therefore accountable, democratic - debate.
It is of much less value when it is reached in closed meetings held in secret meeting rooms which are inaccessible to democratic scrutiny.
An example of this is cooperation in justice and home affairs.
We are all in favour of the European area of justice and police cooperation, but these are extremely sensitive areas which involve fundamental rights and freedoms and the 15 penal codes of our Member States.
It is unacceptable for any democratic debate to be dispensed with, either in the national parliaments or the European Parliament, on issues relating to rights guaranteed by constitutions, in the name of the need for rapid action.
That is the real obstacle: the real obstacle is the democratic nature of the European Union!
We would make this clear, in particular, to Mr Schröder and Mr Chirac, who publicly lamented the lack of rapid action.
Be careful: fundamental rights and freedoms are involved!
The democratic nature of the institutions of the European Union is at stake.
Madam President, as someone who was born and bred in Ghent, I should first of all like to express my satisfaction at the peaceful process of the demonstrations during the European Council in Ghent.
What went wrong in Gothenburg and Genoa did not in Ghent.
That is undoubtedly linked to the changes since 11 September, but also to the sound preparation, the sensible approach by the police and certainly also to the open dialogue that has led to a different atmosphere.
As Mr Verhofstadt has already underlined, the original intention of this informal summit was to prepare for the Laeken Declaration.
The Fifteen defined the parameters and the timeframe for the convention.
As the European Parliament, we should be able to recognise that this was a true tour de force.
Six months ago, this would have been absolutely unthinkable.
Another positive development is the fact that the Union has taken a unanimous and firm stand in the fight against terrorism, has emphatically confirmed its solidarity with the US, but at the same time, has highlighted its own political role.
Strictly speaking, Ghent has thus fulfilled the expectations.
But the way in which European unanimity was brought about has once again exposed the cracks in the European edifice.
Ghent has also painfully accentuated the fact that Nice' s two areas of tension, namely that between the large and small countries, and that between the intergovernmental and community approach, is still heavily mortgaging the European Union' s future.
This applies first and foremost to the CFSP.
The French President is right, strictly speaking, when he states that the European Union is not authorised to deal with military matters.
However, the question is whether we are prepared at all to change this.
The three largest Member States should realise that they cannot continue to be only half-committed to the cause.
This ambiguity cannot remain concealed behind fine sounding final declarations in which attempts are made to keep up appearances of European unanimity.
Let us hope that 11 September and the need to reform the institutions prior to enlargement will encourage Member State governments to look beyond their own national policies and return to the roots of the European Union, namely to promote peace and security in Europe and in the world by intense cooperation between the Fifteen, rather than just three, Member States.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate the Belgian Presidency, as I think that the excellent way in which the Ghent European Council fulfilled its duties and its responsibilities is a positive and hopeful sign that our institutions are working well.
I believe that this European Council was worthwhile, and was acting perfectly within its powers, in other words, in the role of providing guidance.
I would like to make three points in relation to this.
The first point concerns the issues that are called JHA in our jargon.
These issues involve a great deal of intense and difficult work, and the Ministers for Home Affairs and Ministers for Justice of each of our Member States will not be able to make progress on these, unless they have before them bold proposals such as those that Commissioner Vitorino made, and unless they are constantly reminded of the political direction favoured by the European Council.
These are difficult subjects, which require will and political determination in order to make progress.
Thank you, Mr President, for giving these conclusions.
As for the economic situation, I think that the European Council worked hard to point out where the room for discussion between the economic and monetary authorities must be.
If we really want to put in place a policy to support growth, and this is, without doubt, necessary for the European Union, we need everyone to shoulder their responsibilities, to fully utilise the room for manoeuvre in the Stability and Growth Pact and in the monetary policy, to mobilise the European Investment Bank, so that we finally get across the idea that this is a major undertaking, even if it means going back to square one.
This is also the direction that you described, in relation to the launch of the WTO negotiations.
We must not, however, forget our responsibilities, the contribution we can make, for example, to a subject as important as that of cancelling the debts of developing countries.
The third area on which you gave some guidelines, and I would like to thank you for doing so, is that of cross-border payments.
Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the delicate issue of cheques.
At a time when we are changing over to the euro, we know that these cheques are used primarily by vulnerable sectors of society.
So, let us stop creating obstacles and let things take their course, as, for once, we are not in a great rush.
Lastly, Mr President, you stated that you hope the question of Europe' s position on the world stage will be discussed openly at Laeken.
And Mr Prodi, you asked if Europe was absent from the world stage.
No, Europe is not absent!
Europe did everything it could do and everything it should have done.
The only difficulty is that Europe is not always heard that is the problem.
At Durban, we made ourselves heard, but when it comes to having a real influence on the political, diplomatic and military situation, we still lack the support from the European Union.
We are expecting a great deal from the Convention in this respect.
Mr President, when the two planes crashed into the World Trade Center they demolished more than the twin towers.
We also saw the destruction of the European Union's three pillars contrived at the Treaty of Maastricht and our response today requires a fully integrated approach involving trade, finance and security.
The Ghent European Council showed that the Union enjoys both the capacity, and the will, to provide an increased sense of European security, solid in support of American self-defence, and sharing in the campaign to combat terrorism.
This is a European Union increasingly active in its civilian role and far more present in the Middle East peace process.
For us to succeed, we need to put aside our petty squabbles and the interinstitutional rivalries.
The Commission and Council should reflect the impressive cross-party consensus that we have created in Parliament.
In that context I would like strongly to congratulate the Belgian presidency on brokering such a successful deal on the setting up of the convention.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of this House, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office was right to express with some pride that, fortunately, after Gothenburg and Genoa, Ghent was a different G.
We were able to catch our breath in peace for a while.
In fact, Ghent was a ghost town.
When I protested there along with the so-called anti-globalists, Ghent had been totally stripped of its character of a bustling city.
Nevertheless, I am pleased with your statement about the dialogue with the world of the anti-globalists, which is an incorrect way of saying that a growing number of people are concerned about the direction that the world is taking.
We want to move away from the privatisations and liberalisations which are plunging large parts of the world into de facto exclusion.
What action will the Belgian Presidency be taking in order to reform the WTO, for example?
We are looking forward to your efforts, for the introduction of the Tobin tax is a promise which I may have heard in Belgium, but of which I have seen little evidence on the international forum.
However, the spectacle involving the European institutions was not a pretty sight, and I am very disappointed about this.
The Council was overshadowed by the triumvirate of the United Kingdom, France and Germany.
Is that what other countries can expect from a Council?
The Big Three running the show - is that the kind of Europe we want?
The Commission is failing to get a grip on events and the frustration in that respect is culminating in a row about speaking times and the threat of an empty seat in Laeken.
Does the President of the Commission fear that Laeken will be a failure?
The European Parliament is still feeling marginalised, and I am uncertain as to whether a convention can have any real effect in this.
Many people have witnessed the start of the war in Afghanistan, but we do not know where it will take us or how it will end.
We are facing an economic crisis.
We cannot afford failure at Laeken.
Europe simply has to succeed, and the three large institutions must cooperate with that goal in mind.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, I have noted with satisfaction that preparations in Ghent for the Laeken Summit also included a debate on the complex subject of 'The Future of Europe' .
You, Prime Minister, announced that the Laeken statement on this theme would not be a classic statement but an ambitious one that would acknowledge the EU's weaknesses and its citizens' fears and would clearly point out the way to be taken by the enlarged EU in the world of the future.
I am convinced that the Belgian Presidency will do everything possible to bring about a resolution in December that really will live up to this high aspiration.
In my judgment, there is an absolute need for the following to be taken into account when calling a Convention to prepare the next Inter-Governmental Conference: First, the balanced proportional composition of the Convention with representatives of the national parliaments and of the European Parliament analogous with the Convention to draft the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Secondly, members of the national parliaments and representatives of the acceding countries' governments must be involved to the full in the Convention's work and have at least observer status.
Thirdly, the composition of the Convention must ensure that the principle of political pluralism is guaranteed.
Political debates need arguments on both sides which alone ensure that the debates come alive and are interesting, and only if the most diverse political forces from the Member States really work together can a politically sustainable result be achieved which will then enjoy popular support.
Fourthly, there must be complete transparency in the Convention's work, both as regards the conduct of its debates and discussions and also public access to its documentation, which must be guaranteed by all means available.
There is, fifthly, a need for a purposeful and structured dialogue with civil society, and I hope that the Presidency's proposals in this regard will find support among the various governments.
Mr President, I must say that the Ghent Summit was very revealing, both in terms of the process and of the content.
It was revealing in the sense that it, to a fault, confirms the objections on grounds of principle which we Eurosceptics and opponents of the EU have been entertaining.
The very procedure is, of course, based upon its being the big countries that decide.
A secret summit is held in which an agenda is set, effectively preventing the small countries from independently making known their opinions of the political decisions, and that naturally applies first and foremost to the decisions made in the light of the events of 11 September.
Unconditional support is declared, a total acceptance of the United States' s arrangements.
In that way, the objections and reservations that are undoubtedly entertained among the small countries and that find expression in growing opposition to the American strategy are successfully stifled.
The summit' s reference to resolution 1368 is absurd.
As if it legitimised anything!
We are concerned here with a war of aggression contrary to international law.
That is something to which the United States' s allies should be alerting people.
The resolution does not legitimise any intervention or any armed attack upon a foreign state.
As for the crucial issue here, namely the interventions and follow-up provisions where policing and the law are concerned, we are being faced with a demand to implement the most far-reaching infringements of legal rights we have seen in the history of the EU, and they are to take place almost overnight without any preparation.
I would thank the architects of the summit. It has been an eye-opener.
Mr President, we approve the approach of the informal Ghent Council, which reaffirmed its solidarity with the United States, and confirmed and strengthened the implementation of an action plan containing 79 measures to combat terrorism.
On this issue, I can only reiterate what I said on 3 October 2001 in this Chamber, when I called on the Council to give priority, from now on, to security, to review the former strategies that have become inappropriate, to recognise that the controls do not restrict freedom of movement, that they restrict criminals and protect the freedom of our citizens.
At the time, I called for a review of the disastrous Article 62(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, which demands the systematic abolition of controls on third country nationals, when crossing the internal borders of the European Union.
In response, Mr Michel told me that my ideas - and I quote 'would lead straight to a society which restricts freedoms' .
In my view, this unjustified accusation - which I naturally refute - illustrates the reservations and the obstacles we can encounter in our fight against terrorism.
Fortunately, the Council appears to have overcome these obstacles, at least partly, since in the road map published by the last Justice and Home Affairs Council, there is a discreet proposal for the Council to study 'arrangements for coordinated recourse [...] to Article 2(2)' of the Schengen Convention.
So, ladies and gentlemen, what is Article 2(2) of the Schengen Convention?
It is, as you may have guessed, the safeguard clause that my friends and I defended so staunchly, which will be so useful in the future and which enables internal border controls to be re-introduced.
Mentalities are now changing, so all is not lost.
Obviously, we must differentiate between withdrawing freedoms and controls, particularly at borders, which, within the framework of our democratic values, seek to preserve our freedoms.
This distinction is essential.
I hope, and I want to believe, Mr President, that the Council understands this.
Mr President, we evidently need major disasters to illustrate how much a too fragmented Europe is still failing in its ability to shoulder responsibility.
The coalition against terrorism will not function properly if the central player, the United States, is surrounded by only fifteen satellites.
Unfortunately, the European Union has in certain ways still not outgrown the satellite stage.
That particularly applies to the second and third pillars, which are precisely pertinent when we consider international terrorism.
Wherever matters are regulated well at community level (the first pillar), things are much better.
In other words: Europe is good at paying, but not good at making decisions.
That was evident in Bosnia and is now again evident in the fight against international terrorism.
The Union is often not very visible, and I am also delighted that Mr Verhofstadt has explained how seriously he has taken the irregularities that have taken place on this score in Ghent.
That is why we are happy to encourage the Council to give Europe a clear profile in terms of foreign and security policy as soon as possible.
Moreover, the willingness to make the necessary Community changes in terms of justice and internal affairs is also leaving something to be desired.
I am pleased to hear from the President-in-Office of the Council that there is wide agreement among the Heads of Government about the fact that measures must be taken.
Reprehensible, however, are the improper objections which are being lodged by some Ministers for Justice, for example, the Minister in the Netherlands, about Europe' s interference in major issues at national political level, such as, in respect of, the policy of tolerance with regard to drugs, the policy on euthanasia and such like.
That is not at issue at all.
Mr Vitorino, too, has made it abundantly clear that he is closely monitoring subsidiarity on this score.
If the aim of the Ministers is to protect their own official or ministerial scope, then the public will not be served by that.
I would therefore like to warmly congratulate the Council with its statement that our policy to the outside world, also in the framework of globalisation, must be ensconced in ethical, social and ecological standards and must take account of Third World interests.
Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I should like to make a few observations on three external points, starting with the Middle East.
We have experienced the murder of Israel' s Minister for Tourism as a new low.
Subsequently, Israel invaded the autonomous Palestinian regions, which was, of course, an unacceptable violation.
We are all justified in asking for immediate withdrawal.
At the same time, the spokesmen for Mr Sharon, on the one hand, and the Palestinian Authority, on the other, mete out relentless and draining rhetoric of black and white thinking. The others are 100% responsible, they are to blame for everything.
The representative of Mr Sharon has almost stated that the tanks which enter the Palestinian regions are a kind of peace dove.
Conversely, Hanan Ashrawi lays all the blame with Israel.
Neither of them leave room for concern or take any steps towards bringing the conflict to an end.
It appears that, for the time being, there is no chance of returning to the Oslo Agreements or the Mitchell report which is before us.
Needless to say, the neighbouring states play their part too. Countries such as Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Saudi-Arabia are all very important players who have often used the Palestinian issue to their advantage to keep enemies out, but not to do anything of any consequence at home.
There is now scope for Europe, the Commission and the Council, in tandem with the US, to take a very unusual new step and simply to combine our economic and diplomatic power, and our UN responsibility and military power and to say: we are tabling a firm, fresh peace proposal.
For we as the world community, in the light of 11 September, can no longer afford to be dragged down in this continual downward spiral.
As we are well placed in Europe, we can also use intense diplomacy to persuade the countries in the Middle East to take part in the peace accord.
We have money.
We have trade.
We have the UN.
We have resources in that region.
We can be of real significance there.
In this respect, my suggestion would be to adopt a reasonably hard-handed approach towards both parties, for we need to table such a proposal now.
That is my first plea.
My second plea concerns Afghanistan.
The Socialist Group gives the UN resolution, which is very clear, its 100% backing.
The aim of the resolution is to trace both the perpetrators and the sponsors, as well as the countries harbouring them, and to bring them to justice, but also to ensure that we come out alive.
The EU has no military presence in Afghanistan.
That falls within the remit of other bodies: the UN and NATO.
However, we are the body that has the diplomatic power to unite the surrounding countries in that region that play a key role, namely India, Pakistan and Iran, so that they, together with us and the US, give the different parties in Afghanistan plenty of room.
Afghanistan' s key problem is that we will not reach a solution with the Northern Alliance, nor with anyone else.
History has taught us that.
What we need is a conference, wherever that may be in the region, involving the different forces - and I particularly refer to the social forces, such as the women' s organisations - which, together, will shape a new broad government, in exile and only as a first step, if necessary.
However, we must take that political direction.
It is the only way to get rid of the Taliban.
It is the only way to catch Bin Laden.
Prime Minister, your presidency, which was already reasonably complex, is certainly being tested by the attacks in the United States.
Do not, therefore, take any notice of people who say that a meeting of three of your colleagues immediately before the summit was a put-down.
Such a meeting is, of course, never pleasant for a presidency, but it proves at the same time how desperately we need a European framework within which external security, conflict prevention, our diplomacy, but also our internal security, legal and police cooperation can be regulated.
That is important for small Member States such as ours.
However, it is apparently difficult for everyone to understand that if one considers the Union after 11 September, it is, in fact, only small EU Member States that have taken any individual action.
You did not get sidetracked in Ghent.
I would ask you to ensure that this convention - the mere fact that we now have an agreement on this is already quite an achievement for the presidency - is given the appropriate assignments in Laeken.
I should like to say this about Afghanistan: humanitarian aid is only possible if the Taliban regime is removed from power and unfortunately, we need war for this.
And finally, thousands of people were able to protest in Ghent without any incidents.
It has not always been like that. In my opinion, we should draw attention to this for a change.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, the decision of the Council at Ghent to give immediate humanitarian aid totalling EUR 320 million is unusually welcome.
The same applies to European solidarity in the campaign against international terrorism.
The next thing to do is to achieve a speedy halt to the fighting, above all to protect the population of Afghanistan.
The world is still in shock from the attacks on New York and Washington.
Two things strike me as being of particular importance, quite independently of the steps taken to date.
The first is the complete explanation of the background to these crimes and the publication of the results.
Without these, there is the risk that the attacks will give rise to legends which could poison many people's minds.
This would represent an enduring victory for terrorism.
What strikes me, secondly, is that the future reconstruction of Afghanistan presupposes, importantly, knowledge of the events in that country over the past twenty-five years.
As we know relatively little about this period, I propose that this Parliament should set up a group to look into the region and comprehensively document the past three decades in that country.
We could perhaps thereby take the first step towards a peaceful solution and a forward-looking outlook for Afghanistan.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has become clear, particularly in these last weeks and months, that common action by the Member States of the European Union as the European Union brings added value for every one of the EU's members.
When I see, for example, that the troika not only made a very successful contribution to the creation of the coalition against terror in the Middle East but is also responsible for this happening at all, this is important evidence for the truth of this.
So I regret all the more that individual Member States have an ever-increasing tendency towards bilateralism.
For example, the troika was in Washington at the same time as the President of France, the German Foreign Minister, and the Prime Minister of Great Britain.
I do not find that the right way to go about presenting a clear picture of the European Union as a whole.
I also think that the meeting of the three Heads of Government in the run-up to the summit can only give rise to suspicions that we are moving towards an outcome managed from the top downwards.
All the European Union's Member States are basically equal.
The European Union can only exist as it does now in so far as competencies reside in the supranational institutions and the smaller countries do not feel that they are controlled by the larger ones.
We will get into serious difficulties if this principle is not accepted.
Let me raise another point. As the Chairman of my group has already observed, there is the danger that, in the realm of internal security, good decisions by the Council will be ground down in the mills of national bureaucracies.
I would like to suggest that the Belgian Presidency, which has done such excellent work in the past few weeks, should take a look at the Treaty of Amsterdam and tell the Council that, if the Council of Ministers so decides, decisions on legal and home affairs policy may be reached by majority voting - a legal possibility provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam - so that we can come to the necessary decisions at a European level and can meet the challenge of combating terrorism, a phenomenon that knows no frontiers.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, please permit me one more observation and a request. I wish to put on the record my thanks to you that the Convention will be possible.
If possible, though, Laeken should be founded on a procedure that offers the possibility of the Convention coming up with a unitary proposal.
It must be a Convention which can serve as the basis for the consultation of Heads of State and Government.
There is still a lot of concern about it, and I ask you to bear that in mind.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the results of the Ghent Council are without a doubt positive and encouraging, not least - although not exclusively - in terms of the fight against terrorism.
The Convention' s decision is extremely important and mention must be made of the Belgian Presidency' s firm undertaking to achieve these results.
However, in a world political and economic climate which is changing rapidly in the wake of the tragedy of 11 September, and in the face of the new demands from democratic States - primarily for terrorism to be combated, of course, but also for an area of peace and respect for human rights to be created in Asia and the Middle East and, moreover, for economic growth and employment to be boosted - we would like to make quite clear the need for a better coordinated European Union initiative which can speed up the institutional reforms, which are still far from completion, and thus empower the European Union to enter the field as a world political entity, an initiative which is able, that is, to speak with a single voice in Washington and Islamabad alike, as President Prodi advocated.
To give some concrete examples rather than limiting myself to describing vague needs, we would point out the urgency, in particular, for an incisive, coordinated action from the Commission and the High Representative laying the foundations for an - economic and social as well as political - agreement which will lead to the creation of a reunified, coherent, manageable State of Palestine while fully safeguarding the security of the State of Israel, together with an explicit international guarantee, as Mr Van den Berg said just now.
Secondly, we would point out the urgent need for a Commission and Eurogroup initiative to reach long-term agreements with the oil-producing countries in the Middle East in order to secure the continuity of oil supplies and the stability of oil prices in Europe with a guarantee in euro.
This would be a huge political boost to consolidation of peace in that area.
Thirdly, we feel there should be a Commission and Eurogroup initiative to create the conditions for revitalising economic growth and employment in the Union, both by promoting forms of open coordination in the research and development and training sectors, thus setting the Lisbon project in motion, and by transparently inviting the Central Bank to join this effort, using the room for manoeuvre for monetary policy rightly recommended at Ghent, and further reducing interest rates.
After that, Mr President, everyone will be able to assume their responsibilities transparently, in full respect for the independence of the Central Bank.
Mr President, there are two messages coming from this House today.
Firstly, the rather modest compromise resolution drafted by an all-party group which, if I were a member of the forces serving currently in Afghanistan - and I think particularly of the British forces - would give me very scant comfort.
The other message comes from the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Verhofstadt, and deals with a rather more robust approach to the current operations in that area and also his more forward thinking approach towards the future of Afghanistan.
Of course this House must have compromise resolutions and must, so far as possible, be united.
Europe must not act at the level of the lowest common denominator but accept that in politics, as in war, there must be room for leadership.
Today, our resolution does not reflect the sort of leadership which is available for the people of Afghanistan through their exiled king.
Our resolution does not reflect the fact that in Peshawar today there is an enormous meeting taking place of those seeking - including the moderate Taliban - the restoration of democracy in that country.
I believe - as do many of my colleagues - that the king, whom I had the pleasure of meeting on 21 September and whom Mr Solana met only last weekend, does have a role in the future of Afghanistan.
He introduced democracy to that country in 1964: free elections, a free media, universities, hospitals; he introduced women into politics.
It is that hope of the restoration of democracy in Afghanistan and the ending of international terrorism which must be the focus of our attention.
Mr President, I would firstly like to welcome the information from the President-in-Office of the Council on the progress made in relation to measures for combating terrorism and the arrest warrant.
Mr President, justice is a key word on the European and international stages following 11 September.
The creation of a European area of justice is the best contribution the Union could offer at this time.
We are not talking about a European criminal code; that is not what we want.
Neither are we talking about establishing emergency laws.
We are talking about something more fundamental: mutual trust between Member States and between their legitimate judicial systems.
Mr Cappato, I sincerely believe that the proposals which the Commissioner, Mr Vitorino, produced calmly and at the request of this House, and which are of the high quality we normally expect from the Commissioner, deserve our support and must be approved by the Justice and Home Affairs Council.
In no way will they violate the freedom and rights of the citizens.
On the contrary, they protect them, making justice more efficient and putting judicial cooperation in the hands of judges, and not of governments, within the European Union.
I am grateful for the information on the elimination of double incrimination, because - as the Chairman of my group, Mr Barón, said - this House feels that the effort we make to keep up with circumstances is not always reflected in the Council.
We would also be grateful for more precise information on the debates in the Justice and Home Affairs Council and for broader involvement by Parliament.
In this respect, given the speeding up of certain procedures, I wonder, Mr President, if this is not the moment to move cooperation in the criminal field to the first pillar.
I am slightly more sceptical about what has been said about progress on immigration and asylum in the Union.
I believe that not even the greatest will in the world would allow a positive assessment of this issue at Laeken.
There is just one proposal approved by the Council which may be of use today.
Why do we not implement the measures laid down in that one measure adopted in the Directive on the temporary protection of displaced persons?
It seems to me that the situation of the borders of Afghanistan and support for the refugees and the neighbouring countries, issues which the European Union has to deal with, provide us with a perfect opportunity to test this directive, to test the solidarity between the Member States in the European Refugee Fund and to implement what is laid down in it.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, there is no doubt that Europe must play an increasingly influential role in securing world peace.
Little has been achieved thus far and more needs to be done, and here I endorse what President Prodi said regarding the common foreign and security policy.
In the fight against terrorism, a great deal has already been done. Europe has decided to take action but the political support and military support too from many of the States of the Union - Italy announced yesterday the amount of troops and resources it is making available for anti-terrorist actions - will not alone suffice: the crisis in the Middle East needs to be defused.
It may be that what has been termed the Marshall Plan for Palestine has not received enough attention - although it was certainly discussed at the Council.
The population of Palestine has a per capita income of USD 800 per year, whereas the per capita income of the Israeli people is USD 18 000 per year.
There is therefore a substantial difference and I feel that capital and enterprise investments are a way of ensuring lasting peace.
The economic growth of the Palestinian people, who must have a State, will certainly contribute to calming a volatile situation.
We will never win the war against terrorism if we do not first resolve the Middle East question.
I feel that the course embarked upon by the Commission and the Council is the right one.
We are also concerned - as President Prodi himself said - by the economic crisis.
I regret to say that the United States has had to invest USD 150 billion to revitalise the economy.
Europe appears to be concerned but is not doing enough, in our opinion, to support the economy and enterprise: this is not a question of State aid, it is a question of enabling many firms to stay in business, of preventing redundancies, particularly in the airlines sector.
In the case of Alitalia, there is talk of around 5000 redundancies but all the airlines have been affected.
From this point of view, if we are to safeguard employment and make it possible for a large number of firms to stay in business and grow, I feel that Europe, the Council and the Commission must increase their efforts even more.
Mr President, I very much welcome the Belgian Presidency's use of the summit as an opportunity to put euro notes and coins at the top of the agenda.
Monetary union is, after all, not only for large businesses but also for every citizen.
I very much hope that this will be taken as a positive signal.
I would like to underline again that the position taken by the Heads of State and Government with regard to the Commission's proposal on charges for trans-frontier money transfers is surely a step in the right direction.
We, the European Parliament, will, no doubt, also take this step in the next plenary session.
The current situation as regards employment and the economy, that is, the state of the labour market, as well as consumer confidence, should surely be seen in a very critical light.
I welcome the Commission's report to the Council on the appraisal of the economic consequences of the terrible events of 11 September.
It is, I believe, important that we agree on a Community-wide approach.
Not everywhere is there evidence of one.
I believe that, in this situation, we must, now as in the past, stick with structural reforms and the advances they have achieved, particularly in the financial markets but also in the markets for goods and services and that we at the same time must not only underline the need for sound finances in the European Union and adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact, but should also make use of the flexibility for which this Pact provides, for we need more investments in the European Union.
Now as before, the Lisbon way is the right one, relying as it does on growth that is supported by investment and creates jobs and, above all, on mutual support in economic, employment and social policy.
Only when all the macro-economic actors have played their parts can our policy in the European Union be successful.
In these times of crisis we must hold fast to this, and the European Investment Bank, too, must be strengthened even more than previously in its task of helping public investments towards breakthroughs in the area of infrastructure.
By this I mean trans-frontier infrastructure measures in the EU itself, but also such as will connect our European Union with the states of Central and Eastern Europe.
Mr President, the fight against terrorism is clearly the current major concern of the European citizens and it therefore also has to be the main priority of our political action.
Mr President, I am talking about terrorism in all its forms, because there is no legal or moral basis for distinguishing between forms of terrorism, just as there is no such thing as a good murder or a bad murder.
In this respect, the action plan against terrorism, which the Belgian Presidency and the Commission are promoting vigorously, includes measures which we had argued for before 11 September.
In fact we must remember that the proposals in this area presented by the Commission are not the result of improvisation, but they conform to a mandate received at the European Council in Tampere, whose implementation had suffered considerable delay, which was condemned by the European Parliament on several occasions.
We are still awaiting the final approval of the Regulation on the freezing of assets, incorporating, it is true, as the European Parliament argued for, a list of European terrorist organisations, taking into account the financial operative support and propaganda framework of the terrorists.
I therefore believe that we must welcome the Council' s commitment to approve a package of measures at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 6 and 7 December.
I am sure that the European Parliament will rise to the occasion and approve its consultative opinion before that.
Mr President, I will end by saying that none of these instruments being provided to the judicial administration of the Member States imply the least restriction of the civil liberties of European citizens, but quite the opposite: they provide additional means for protecting the freedom which those who use terrorism to try to impose their ideas take away from the individual.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the impression which our citizens have gleaned from the European Council of Ghent is rather chaotic: a closed down city, three major countries making prior arrangements, an angry Belgian President, disparate final declarations by Heads of Government and, to finish off, an angry Commission President.
At a time when unity of action is vital, Europe is divided.
I should like to make three observations.
The United Kingdom, Germany and France have lent their full support to the United States. In fact, the UK is even granting active military support.
I welcome this.
Other EU countries that are also members of NATO are providing more passive support.
The EU countries that are not NATO members lend political support via diplomatic channels.
These are three different kinds of support without any clear interrelation for the citizen.
And then the EU President asked for an evaluation.
So you, in fact, put a seed of doubt into our minds as to whether that support would last.
Against this backdrop, it is hardly surprising that the United States is seeking support from countries outside the European Union, including Canada, Australia and the Pacific Association.
I would call for more coordination in Europe' s support for the actions against terrorism in the coming months, so that the image of division will soon be one of the past.
Secondly, I should like to comment on cooperation in the field of internal security.
Commissioner Vitorino has tabled the proposals extremely promptly, and these include one about a European regulation against money laundering, one concerning arrest warrants and one harmonising penalties.
In fact, those proposals had already partly been tabled.
Last week, the Council of Ministers for Internal Affairs failed to reach agreement. That was also the case for the European Council in Ghent.
Why did the Heads of Government fail to make those executive decisions?
Surely it is hardly justifiable vis-à-vis the citizens for the EU to be undecided about anti-terrorism measures at home.
Then there is the convention, which receives my support, because the Council has adopted the wish of the European Parliament and my group for a convention with a broad parliamentary basis.
We are less happy about the proposal to ask the convention to supply options.
That is the type of question you might ask a consultancy bureau, but not a parliamentary body.
Let the convention determine its own working method and submit its own proposals.
That worked for the Charter and, in my opinion, will work again now.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, the informal summit in Ghent has shown two positive aspects, namely fundamental agreement on a Convention to prepare a constitutional treaty and the final technical adjustments to the euro.
Under other circumstances, without the shadow cast by terrorism, this would be an occasion for looking optimistically towards Europe's future.
We are, however, concerned with a situation in which we ask ourselves whether, with the euro, Europe's capacity for integration has already been exhausted.
A common currency, a common foreign policy and a common defence policy would give the EU that credibility in the eyes of its citizens and create that identification with it, whose absence we often regret.
It has been, above all, in respect of foreign and security policy, that the Ghent Summit has brought us down to earth.
Bilateralism, if you want to call it that, or undeclared intensified cooperation, laid bare the weaknesses that still handicap the European Union's effectiveness vis-à-vis the rest of the world.
Reviewing the international analyses following the Ghent meeting shows how the shock at the terrorist attacks on the USA has revealed the divisiveness within the European Union.
It is not only a reaction to the behaviour of the USA, which prefers to deal and negotiate with governments direct, but also the consequence of the inherent military weakness of the European security and defence policy, in which there is a yawning gulf between ambition and reality.
It is no secret that there are doubts as to whether the training of the European Rapid Reaction Force of 60 000 men is actually going to be completed by the 2003 deadline.
The European Union needs an energy boost, not only to unite it more closely with its citizens but, above all, in order that it might fully meet its responsibilities within Europe itself and as a partner of the USA.
The process of enlargement must be seen from this point of view, as must the post-Nice order, involving a Convention which should not be content to fritter away its time but, as the European Parliament has recommended, should work out a coherent basis for a decision on a constitutional treaty.
Mr President, the European Council confirmed and reinforced Europe' s decision to stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States to combat terrorism and ensure internal security, and also its commitment to avoiding a humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan.
After 11 September, the political geography of the world has changed radically.
However, the Shanghai Summit will be more important than the restricted summit at Ghent.
What is the European Union' s role?
Is a single foreign and security policy possible?
Will we be able to reinvigorate the Mediterranean initiative and work for peace in the Middle East?
In reality, good intentions are often contradicted by the behaviour of certain governments, who delay integration and endeavour to take away the political influence of a Convention which should be developing the method and objectives.
This is what we expect from Laeken and from an Intergovernmental Conference which needs to reform the Union before the European elections.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over and above all the constitutional issues, the present situation sees Europeans being asked the question: What is your capacity to act?
Is the European Union perceived as being able to act in the context of efforts to deal with this international crisis, or is it not?
To ask the question is to answer it in the negative, because the ones taking action are the Americans and, alongside them, partly the British and their allies, but not the European Union as such.
Nor should the British allow themselves to be deceived.
They too are only a small junior partner in the business and have nothing like the weight that Europeans could have if they acted together.
Only as a community will Europeans acquire capacity to act - they will not do it bilaterally, trilaterally or multilaterally.
So it was a gross error for the ruling Big Three to set off before Ghent.
Far from demonstrating European capacity to act, that is a trip down a one-way street, showing considerable lack of awareness of how Europe works.
Those who have acted in this way had better take good note of that.
We need capacity to act as a Community.
So we need the European Rapid Reaction Force.
Without such an instrument, Europeans will not be taken seriously in the world.
That is why it is ridiculous for us still to be arguing about how this instrument should be financed.
In this respect, the Community must prove its strength.
We also, however, need an instrument at home.
We need the capacity to combat terrorism across national frontiers.
Police work goes on in the Member States, but it must be clear to all that international terrorism can only be combated with any prospect of success by units that are in a position to operate without regard to national boundaries.
Action as a Community is what Europe lacks, and it is on that that we must concentrate.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the various interlocutors and groups for their observations.
I think that, except for two or three speeches, a predominantly positive evaluation has been made of the outcome of Ghent.
Such a positive evaluation from the various groups encourages us, of course, to continue our hard work in the coming weeks, for we have another important summit coming up, namely the Summit of Laeken.
I would also like to respond, as follows, to a few oblique remarks that have been made about the cooperation between myself and Mr Romano Prodi: our cooperation is excellent.
In fact, we have just decided to come to the next press conference on a tandem, so as to rule out any further misunderstandings.
Since we both are accomplished cyclists, this will undoubtedly be appreciated by Parliament.
I should in any event like to react to three points.
First of all, a few times, the question has been asked: so where exactly is the Union' s foreign policy now?
I think that Mr Romano Prodi has already entered into more detail on this and has, actually, made very valid points.
Last time we had an international crisis, the Gulf War, Europe had fifteen different opinions on the stance the Union should adopt.
Each Member State had its own opinion on the matter.
In today' s international crisis, we have, for the first time, displayed a united front on two occasions, on 21 September and last Friday in Ghent, in a matter which is, actually, very complex.
Firstly, to what does the stance of the fifteen Member States regarding the attacks in Washington and New York bear witness?
A joint vision and a joint approach.
Secondly, what is the stance now after 7 October?
After all, things changed on 7 October, since the reaction from the United States and the international coalition.
Again, we have a joint stance.
It is important in my view to underline this, for there was a time in the European Union when this was different.
Mr Romano Prodi reminded us that each time there was an international conflict, there was not one stance, but fifteen stances within the Council.
Now this no longer holds true.
However much I am of the personal view - which I share with many of you - that we should take things further still, for example that, certainly in the field of European defence, we should have made much more progress by now, I still believe that we should underline this positive development.
At long last, little by little, piece by piece, a common foreign policy of the European Union is forming, something which, say fifteen years ago, was almost unthinkable.
From that point of view, I believe, in fact, that Mr Van den Berg is more than right in emphasising the role we are to play now.
For our role is different from that of the United States.
The EU' s role is mainly one of political, logistical support, and diplomatic action to be undertaken.
He is right in highlighting the importance of the mandate which we have received from the Council with regard to the Middle East.
We, that is, Mr Romano Prodi, Mr Javier Solana and myself, are considering a date when we could undertake this important mission. Possibly the third week of November.
For I believe that it is up to the European Union, especially the European Union, to take an initiative in this respect.
However, we must be realistic and not foster any illusions.
We cannot solve matters with just one visit - there have been many already - but perhaps by gaining momentum in one particular area, this could ultimately lead to an initiative.
The second point I would like to make relates to what several Members have said and particularly concerns Mr Poettering' s comments.
Mr Poettering said that the Presidency was doing a good job. He mentions the work on the single European arrest and extradition warrant by the ministers of the specialised Councils, amongst others.
But when will this come about?
It is obvious.
This very specific task was given to the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers and they must finalise the practical details before 6 and 7 December 2001.
Mr Poettering, I have already said - not today, not on 19 October but on 21 September - on behalf of the European Council, that the specialised ministers were given the task of finalising the details.
The only thing that I have done, with the help of the Commission and all the Member States of the European Union and the European Council, is to go further at the Ghent Council and to obtain approval of the principle of abolishing the double criminality system.
(NL) At the most recent Council, we at least managed to reach agreement on this, for that is the most important point.
It is easy to proclaim that a European mandate must be obtained, also for extradition.
The most important point had not yet been reached, namely an agreement on the principle of the abolition of dual criminality, not only for terrorist acts but also for other serious crimes.
We must indeed challenge a reductionist attempt to render the provision only applicable to terrorist acts.
That was not the conclusion reached in Tampere.
The Tampere conclusions were in favour of broadening the scope, in other words for other, serious crimes to fall within its scope.
I am therefore personally optimistic with regard to 6 and 7 December. I am addressing Mr Poettering and also Mr Cox, in particular.
But have no fear, if the Ministers for Internal Affairs and Justice fail to come up with the goods, then I will be taking the dossier to the European Council of Laeken on 15 December where the Heads of State and Government will decide.
However, I am convinced that the Ministers for Justice will not let things get so far that ultimately, the Heads of Government will have to solve a technical problem which is predominantly concerned with modality.
Finally, I also should like to briefly comment on the third point, namely the Union' s future.
I believe that we are all agreed that 11 September has shown that a more integrated, more progressive Union is needed, a Union with greater ability to act, which has better instruments at its disposal, and which - certainly as far as the foreign and defence policy is concerned - has greater powers.
To pave the way for this is exactly the intention of the Laeken Declaration.
Therefore, I can already give very concrete answers to the generally positive evaluation based on that convention.
The convention is a fact.
Yes, Mr Poettering, the presidency is a limited presidency in line with the request of all groups, comprising five people including the president of the convention.
Yes, the Member States and MEPs are proportionately represented, although exact numbers will need to be discussed in due course.
Yes, civil society is involved, not by setting up a new body but by creating a network around the convention whereby groups in society can refer to the convention and whereby, conversely, the convention can also seek advice from European affairs study centres, trade unions, any other organisations which exist in our society, as well as civil society.
A flexible network around the convention therefore seems preferable to the organisation of a special forum.
Finally, I should like to respond to the most fundamental question which has been repeatedly raised here.
Indeed, it is related to that text. If that text originates from that convention, how will the Council then relate to it?
Will it be considered a report that can be dismissed and need not be taken into consideration?
A discussion has therefore arisen as to the question of whether that is now a consensus text or a text providing options.
The answer is very simple.
That will, at any rate, be my reply in a few weeks' time when we are all meeting in Laeken.
If everyone is agreed, then we will have a consensus text. In other words, it will then be quite clear that this is an important - if not the most important - contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference.
If no consensus is reached at the convention, then I obviously believe that options should be given, not in a neutral manner, but in such a way that the majority and minority options are clearly indicated, as well as the individual option of one member of the convention, if applicable.
It was also my intention to talk this over with the chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Napolitano, and the two draftsmen of opinion on the future of Europe.
I cannot see the sense of unleashing a holy war among ourselves as to the exact significance of that text.
If consensus is reached, then we have a consensus text.
If we cannot have a consensus text because we failed to reach consensus, options must be indicated, but not in a neutral manner, not in a way as if we were supplying a list without any significance. Instead, we should highlight the majority and minority options, in other words, the wishes and trends which originated at the convention and which have been brought forward.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a few comments on this debate, which has revealed great unity, not just between Council and Commission but also between these institutions and Parliament.
I would just like to focus on a few issues which appear to have remained unresolved.
Firstly, the issue has been raised, starting with Chairman Poettering, of the amount of aid granted to refugees.
I would like to say that the immediate appropriation has been decided of EUR 315 million, but the problem is not now, at this time, I regret to say, financial, but the enormous practical difficulties of getting the aid to the people concerned.
We are working through the NGOs and many other organisations.
I would stress that, as things stand now, sufficient funds have been transferred in practical terms. When further funds are needed, then we will come back here to request them and discuss the matter together: the present problem is the difficulty of implementing these operations.
I will now turn to another debate, taken up by a number of speakers, including Mr Tajani and several others, who linked this major phenomenon of the world being divided into two parts to peace in Palestine.
This is an issue of fundamental importance, in which regard I would point out to Mr Tajani and the other speakers that what has been termed the 'reconstruction plan for Palestine' is something which is very much on our minds: I have discussed it many times with Mr Peres and we are well aware that we should concentrate on taking action in certain sectors such as water, energy, infrastructure and revitalising industry.
This is our duty and the Palestinian and Israeli citizens know that the Commission is focusing its efforts in that direction.
As soon as the political conditions allow, we will be here, requesting the necessary resources.
However, I believe that the knowledge that we are taking practical action and are all ready to work together is in itself conducive to peace.
Then, Prime Minister Verhofstadt spoke about the decisions adopted in the field of justice and the fight against financial crime.
I agree with what he said, but we must be careful.
We have adopted decisions here: if we do not implement them we will lose all credibility.
Therefore, the ministers responsible must speed up the implementation of these decisions or else they will be taken again at the summit.
A further point related to the Convention.
A general agreement has been adopted on the board, the executive structure and so forth.
I would, however, like to focus on one point, touched upon by Prime Minister Verhofstadt, which is the duration of the Convention.
Parliament and the Commission have guided and supported the Convention' s creation: they must support its work and they must support its conclusion, and so the work must reach its conclusion before the start of the electoral campaign for the European elections.
This is a genuine deadline, not a theoretical one.
Many speakers have brought up the issue of the Community method in this debate.
Well then, on this matter I would simply like to borrow a vivid picture painted by Mr Duff.
He said: "When the two planes crashed into the World Trade Centre they demolished more than the twin towers. We also saw the destruction of the European Union's three pillars contrived at the Treaty of Maastricht."
This is, in my opinion, a correct, responsible, practical observation.
Mr Duff has fully understood the political meaning of the Commission' s efforts to achieve unified Union action by applying the Community method, which is the only effective way of ensuring success.
A further point, mentioned by all the speakers, is the issue of the institutional reforms.
The Commission and Parliament are working on the practical aspects of this matter: we have argued and helped each other, and I think we are making progress - painstaking progress - in our joint work. We have not yet finished but we are working, so to speak, on the bricks and mortar, on the concrete facts.
At this point, although I do not wish to interfere with the internal organisation of the Council, I would point out that our reform will not be sufficiently effective if it is not accompanied by a reform of the Council' s working procedures.
(Applause)
My intention in saying this is not to interfere in other people' s business but to stress the need for effectiveness.
We need to bring all our work out into the open and achieve more transparency, accountability and democracy in our governance.
The Commission has already addressed this point in its White Paper and we and Parliament expect to debate it with the Council.
With regard to the economy, everyone has stressed the difficulty of implementing the Lisbon decisions.
However, this is an area in which there has been a vast difference between the general decisions taken and the implementation of the decisions in subsequent individual Councils, with regard to liberalisation and market reform, speeding up innovation, and projects ranging from the creation of the single air space to the establishing of the Community patent, areas in which we are still extremely behind schedule.
Our economy will only become dynamic if we rectify these shortcomings.
Lastly - and, in this respect, more great progress has been made - we have undertaken to support the introduction of the euro with the indispensable backup measures such as the single market in cross-border bank transfers.
We have committed ourselves to this and it is an absolutely crucial point.
Finally, one last point on the subject of the Convention.
I will go back to Mrs Maij-Weggen' s comment on the actual definition of the Convention: we cannot consider it to be a consultative body, as some have described it.
It cannot be a body which just gives advice and is then disbanded and no longer involved.
We are making the Convention as transparent as possible but also giving it as much democratic authority as possible, and we therefore expect it to produce major, incisive results.
I would add, moreover, that the presence of the Convention is a breath of fresh air amongst the closed doors of secretive diplomacy.
The air of democracy is nourished by the oxygen of transparency and accountability, and the Commission therefore fully supports the commencement of the Convention' s work so that dialogue will, at last, be opened between the institutions and between the institutions and the European citizens.
(Applause)
Thank you, President Prodi.
As you heard, during the last part of your speech there was a buzz of voices which made it difficult for all the Members who were listening attentively to your speech to hear properly.
I apologise for this.
Steps must be taken to avoid such disturbance once and for all.
As you and my fellow Members can see, all those who were not paying attention to your speech are continuing to chat in the corridors and will only sit down when the next President opens voting time.
I have received six motions for resolution pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 10 a.m.
Mr President, the confusion in the House before voting time is in danger of becoming a moral issue.
It is a political issue and is the result of the way our work is organised, with the debates taking place separately from the votes.
Parliament is becoming a voting parlour, and this is the inevitable consequence.
If we want to avoid this confusion, then we must allow a 15-minute pause between the debate and the votes. That way there will be less people attending the debates and we will be able to become a voting parlour pure and simple and increasingly less a Parliament!
Thank you for your comment.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the deluge of e-mails which we are currently receiving, as a result of which my computer refuses to work and I can no longer locate the actual e-mails that I should like to read.
Could you see to it that something is done about this by the offices?
We will certainly take note of this.
VOTE
The Commission can accept in part or in spirit Amendments Nos 1, 5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 and 16.
The Commission rejects Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 and 17.
Before the vote on Amendment No 17: Gröner (PSE).
(DE) Mr President, we had reached a compromise with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and they are now departing from it.
So we too will not now abide by this compromise, and I call on my group to vote in favour of Amendment No 17.
Voting time will now be suspended and resumed after the formal sitting on the occasion of the visit of his Holiness the XIVth Dalai-Lama.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.30 p.m.)
Mr President, I should like to mention that the Greens and the Liberals have kindly invited everyone to their joint meeting this afternoon to meet His Holiness, the Dalaï Lama, at 3 p.m. in Room 100 in WIC - that means everybody who was not included in the invitation of the PSE and the PPE-DE.
Welcome
I would like to welcome the Prime Minister of Bulgaria, Mr Simeon Saxe-Coburg, who has taken a seat in the visitors' gallery. He is visiting the European institutions.
Prime Minister, on behalf of President Fontaine, welcome to the European Parliament. I hope that the accession of your country, which we hope will happen as soon as possible, will lead to the consolidation of the democratic process which has been set in motion and enable the Bulgarian people to take its rightful place in the Community of the peoples of the European Union.
(Applause)

Hautala report (A5-0358/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, as a Member of the joint EU-Bulgaria Parliamentary Committee, I too would like to welcome the Prime Minister of Bulgaria.
I will have the pleasure of visiting your country next week, Prime Minister, and I therefore welcome your presence here and hope that Bulgaria will soon become a fully paid-up Member of the European Union.
With regard to Mrs Hautala' s document, I have to ask myself, and you, Mr President, this question: if many Muslims are so resolute in their oppression of women - they do not even allow women to walk down the road like human beings - how can we allow them to enter the European Union if they cannot respect this and all the other European Union directives on equality between men and women?
We need to reflect on this point.
The pursuit of the second wave of the feminist movement in the 60s and 70s was strongly focused on enabling women to get on in paid jobs.
On average, women were not as highly trained as men, and even if they were, due to male domination, they often got the jobs with the lowest status and the lowest income.
Moreover, many women were financially dependent on their husbands.
Highly trained women were right to claim access to jobs from which, in those days, they were almost automatically excluded.
For women who were less highly trained, the situation was often different.
Cleaning offices or stacking shelves in supermarkets are not demanding jobs, and, in many cases, not to be preferred to the role of housewife.
That group of women experienced it, in many cases, as liberating if the income of their husbands obviated the need for them to work.
Most women now have a paid job, while men do not work fewer hours to look after and raise the children.
Feminism has become the employers' accidental instrument to solve staff shortages and to limit government spending.
Certainly under those circumstances, it is even more important to actively fight any form of discrimination and intimidation at work.
Miguélez Ramos report (A5-0335/2001)
Mr President, it was with great pleasure that I read Mr Ramos' rather technical document, which also has great political meaning for me.
As you are aware, I have been a regional councillor of the Lombardy region for five years. My daughter, Elisabetta, has been a regional councillor of the Liguria region for five years and is currently a regional councillor of the Lombardy region, for the Pensioners' Party of course.
I say this with pleasure in order to stress my personal hope - in addition to what is, I believe, the hope of all of us - that the regions in Europe will gain increasingly in political and decision-making importance and that they will be allowed to participate more fully in the production of the European directives and regulations which concern them.
. (EL) The debate on territorial units for statistics (NUTS) is not a technical debate about statistics because regional statistics and the classification of regions on the basis of NUTS provide a constant line of reference for analysing social and economic developments in the regions and determining which areas are eligible for structural support.
One of the most serious problems is that completely different political and economic units are used as a basis for collating and processing statistics.
This is no accident and arouses even greater suspicion in conjunction with the fact, as the report quite rightly points out, that the Commission exercises 'a great deal of flexibility' when applying the criteria for classifying an area in NUTS É, ÉÉ, or ÉÉÉ, using them as it pleases, depending on the 'needs' of the case.
For example, a NUTS III type administrative division is used to allocate funds to Objective 2, thereby subsidising half the population of the Union and drastically reducing the funds available for the less developed areas for which they are supposedly intended.
Between 1994 and 1999 (Delors II package) 51% of the population of the ÅU received support, of which only 25% corresponded to Objective 1, which funds NUTS II type regions.
Lastly, of this 25%, only 16.4% related to Objective 2.
In other words, because a small administrative division was used (NUTS ÉÉÉ), the rich countries received considerable support, thereby blatantly distorting regional policy in practice.
Finally, it is again the rich countries which benefit, gobbling up a large slice of what are already miserly and insufficient appropriations from the Structural Funds.
Some countries benefit even more because the NUTS III type administrative divisions are very small compared with other countries.
For example, this sort of administrative division (prefecture) has a surface area of 2,950 square metres in Greece, 3,162 square metres in Portugal and a mere 758 square metres in Germany.
All this illustrates, yet again, the malfunctions, inequalities, irregularities and hypocrisy of ÅU regional policy, in that a large chunk of the appropriations distributed in structural aid is 'recycled' and finds its way back to the more developed Member States, thereby seriously curtailing the potential for any national development policy, which is forced to remain within the confines of the poorly tailored Community 'straitjacket' .
As a result, not only do we fail to achieve the much-vaunted objective of convergence between the poorest and richest regions but, as the figures confirm - and Greece is a prime example - there is increasing divergence, not just between Member States in the north and the south, but between regions within Member States themselves.
The only thing achieved with any degree of satisfaction is that people have been paid to turn a blind eye and mechanisms have been created to promote the interests of the large monopolies, which have benefited most from Community programmes.
Despite the fact that the rapporteur's report fails to 'bring matters to a head' , it does at least touch on several serious problems and we shall support it.
Weiler report (A5-0360/2001)
. (PT) The study contained in the 2001 Joint Employment Report, produced on the basis of national reports, demonstrates how little attention most Member States pay to employment guidelines.
In fact, only seven have paid any attention to the general objectives laid down at the Lisbon Council and reaffirmed at the Stockholm Council, and only three have referred to the specific objectives on the rate of employment for women.
As stated in the opinion of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, to which we contributed proposals, that were approved, antagonism clearly exists between the objectives for employment rates that have been laid down by the Council and the minimal importance that the majority of the Member States attach to integrating sensitivity to gender issues in their employment policies.
This failure to integrate such sensitivity in Member State policies can be seen in the lack of national objectives for reducing the various disparities between the genders in the labour market, whether these be a lack in adequate childcare services, or the limited initiatives for reducing wage disparities between the sexes, for example.
The Weiler report is not sufficiently critical of the current employment situation in the European Union, although it does acknowledge some negative aspects of practices in these areas of employment, specifically where it focuses on the need to establish national targets and on meeting them.
It does not, however, provide a critical analysis of the guidelines proposed by the Commission nor does it offer any clear alternatives for issues that we need to commit to, specifically the need to give priority to employment policies or not to continue the current trend of subordinating these policies to monetarist ones, thereby finally burying the neoliberal approach that prevails in the European Union, having rejected the proposals that we tabled on this matter.
. The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports the thrust of the Weiler report on the employment guidelines for 2002.
It also has a lot of sympathy for the amendments submitted by Mr Bushill-Matthews but feels that the Weiler report is not the appropriate report for such amendments.
.
(EL) Without doubt the economic crisis is worsening, having already been exacerbated by the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington.
This recession, which appears to have set in for the duration, at least according to most analysts, cannot be resolved, yet again, at the expense of the workers, by making mass redundancies and eroding their rights.
Overall employment has basically bottomed out and unemployment is staying put, even if it is not increasing as, for example, in my country.
At the same time, more mass redundancies are on the cards in important sectors of the economy, such as transport, tourism etc.
Employment policies have become an exercise in apportioning unemployment, even more so in the guidelines for 2002.
It is no accident that the countries 'patted on the back' here by the EU are the countries which first proceeded to overhaul the labour market, especially by extending part-time and other forms of flexible employment.
The European Parliament report supports the guidelines, which revert to the familiar subjects of structural reform and more flexible employment contracts, the purpose of which is to create a huge army of employable people with no rights or claims, whose productivity and competitiveness are tailored to the speculative demands of big business and its interests.
Geographical mobility of the workers serves no purpose except to strengthen the concentration of human resources and wealth in the rich areas of the ÅU, which get richer by absorbing the best manpower and scientists.
The sole purpose of the second pillar of the guidelines on entrepreneurship is to make the unemployed self-employed, thereby artificially reducing unemployment and rejecting the responsibilities of social solidarity.
As for subsidised job schemes, not only have they been completely ineffectual in combating unemployment, the money has generally gone straight into the employers' pockets and workers have been replaced by the subsidised unemployed, resulting in constant infringements of collective agreements.
Continuing privatisation, mergers, adjustment to EMU, increased imports and more intense capitalist competition, thousands of small and medium-sized farms wiped out and the closure of small and medium-sized enterprises have created conditions for spiralling unemployment.
The policy which the ÅU persists in applying, despite an average rate of growth of 3.3% in 2000, does not appear to be reducing the unemployment or the poverty which is the bane of the lives of 22% of the population of the ÅU.
The workers want a different policy, a policy predicated on people and their needs, with full, secure social rights for all workers, a better standard of living and real social development and prosperity.
We are mainly well disposed towards Mrs Weiler' s report.
We particularly appreciate the emphasis she places upon the quality of work.
We are nonetheless critical of quite a few of the amendments by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs which make sweeping ideological statements about the market economy and the way it is run.
We believe that an economic policy is thus being recommended that militates against the European employment strategy, especially during periods when the economy and demand for labour are not expanding.
Because these amendments have been adopted by the House, we chose to abstain in the final vote.
. I wholeheartedly support this report by Ms Weiler which welcomes the 2002 employment guidelines.
Whilst the report recognises that full employment can be achieved through further structural reforms of the labour market, it also calls for increased investment in training, especially for job seekers.
The quantitative, as well as qualitative, returns that the EU would reap as a result of its commitment to training are unquestionable.
Training and education are essential ways in which EU Member States can jointly boost the EU's employment rate.
Time and again in Member States, investment in education and training has proved to be successful and when coordinated at a pan-European level, this would be amplified.
It is important that these commitments are realised and that they do not simply turn into hot air.
Finally, the recommendation that both sides of industry should agree on changes in working practices could pave the way for enhanced industrial relations and create a situation whereby the specialist knowledge of each party is fully utilised.
Seppänen report (A5-0350/2001)
Madam President, you, like me, love the sea and have often visited my city, Genoa, which I have admired for 20 years from the top of the Righi hills.
I see the sea and reflect deeply.
The sea unites, the sea belongs to everyone, the sea has no borders.
It is therefore right that the European Union should concern itself with all seas, particularly those which bathe the shores of some of our States, and that it should provide financial aid, not least, as in this case, to States beyond its borders such as Russia, for environmental projects to make these seas cleaner, more navigable and more beautiful.
Mr President, Mr Fatuzzo' s explanations of vote are so poetic that I would like to ask you, as a member of the Bureau, whether the Presidency has any intention of publishing these speeches in a book, considering their value and the sentiments pervading them which surpass all the other speeches in the House and endow them with a poetic value that Parliament must not fail to appreciate.
I will inform the Bureau of your suggestion, Mr Dell' Alba.
Virrankoski report (A5-0345/2001)
Mr Dell' Alba, in a minute you will see that not all Mr Fatuzzo' s speeches are poetic.
This one concerns nuclear power stations.
Clearly, through this funding we are protecting the Chernobyl power station - and I voted for the motion - but we must think carefully: should we really close the Bohunice power station in Slovakia - which I visited with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy last week - and on which thousands of billions have been spent to increase safety, and make its closure a non-negotiable condition for Slovakia' s accession to the European Union?
Should we not think more carefully about this?
The manufacturing companies that used to buy energy from Chernobyl, and by means of which it was possible to sustain such a colossal complex of nuclear reactors, are, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, largely non-existent.
The population of the Ukraine is so impoverished that it lacks the purchasing power to be able to buy any substantial amount of electricity as a consumer.
Neither is there any internal funding available to finance new, cleaner and safe methods of generating electricity, and, given the long half-life of radio-active material, we will need to be very patient before what is left of the demolished stations is removed.
Everything that is being done now, unfortunately, is impossible without outside aid.
The measures to provide Chernobyl with a new protective casing by 2005, are too little and too late.
The first casing - erected shortly after the disaster in 1986 - still conceals a dangerous seat of fire, and nuclear energy remains a source of future risks.
In the debate on 2 May regarding 15 years of Chernobyl, I already indicated that other types of nuclear power plants are also unsafe and that they, upon closure, leave a legacy impossible to solve.
Despite all these shortcomings, I support this finance proposal, for doing nothing is not a solution at all.
Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou report (A5-0328/2001)
Mr President, I voted for Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou' s report.
It concerns the Social Fund, which, as we know, is a fund dedicated to workers and to improving and enhancing the chances of the unemployed of finding work.
In particular, this document regulates the definition of innovative measures, that is the new initiatives in this sector.
I would like to take the opportunity afforded by this last explanation of vote to wish you 'Bon appétit' , of course, and to apologise for the drain on the European Parliament' s finances, for I have been informed that every minute of my speeches costs the institution ITL 1,2 million.
If the services were willing to pay half of it to please Mr Fatuzzo, I could save on the other half and not make any more speeches.
Joking apart, I would like to end this explanation of vote by calling for the innovative measures of the Social Fund to be encouraged and accepted, even if they are proposed to the Union by the candidate countries.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Council reform
The next item is the report (A5-0308/2001) by Mr Poos, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the reform of the Council [2001/2020(INI)].
Mr President, it is a true honour for me to be able to present to you this report on Council reform in the presence of Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, representing the Council and Mr Barnier, representing the Commission.
This own-initiative report does not concern the Council alone. It also concerns the European Parliament and Commission in equal measure, as they have the same interest in ensuring that the three institutions work well, and are efficient and coherent.
In an enlarged Union, it is imperative that the Community institutions improve their ability to make decisions and increase their reaction time.
I do not believe that it constitutes any insider dealing to state that today the Council is the most badly organised institution.
This is a serious problem, since this institution, which has both executive and legislative competences, is still, in spite of the changes made to the Treaty, the European Union' s main centre of power.
The Council has already lost much of its effectiveness.
In my report, you will find a long list of dysfunctions.
The Council itself had carried out some preparatory work three or four years ago and I used this and other work as a basis.
Since then, however, nothing has been done, although some other preparatory work was carried out by former - and very key - figures on the international stage, and I shall mention, in particular, the Notre Europe working group led by Jacques Delors.
One of the dysfunctions that I must emphasise particularly is institutional digression, which has primarily been at the expense of Community procedures, along with the Commission.
The rise in power of the European Council, combined with the weakness of the General Affairs Council, has re-established the intergovernmental method of preparing decisions.
The aides, or 'sherpas' , used by the Heads of State, have reintroduced a method that is reminiscent of nineteenth century secret diplomacy.
Mini-summit meetings, like the one held at Ghent, have brought back the tendency to place control in the hands of a chosen few, a dream that some have never given up on since the Fouchet plan of the 1960s.
In order to correct this digression, I recommend nothing more and nothing less than going back to the Treaty.
We should ask the European Council to stop tackling detailed issues and to stop acting like an enormous vacuum cleaner that tries to deal with all the important decisions.
You should not bite off more than you can chew.
What is even worse is that the European Council now causes the institutional system to come to a standstill.
No one dares to make a decision anymore.
Everything is now referred back to those at the top.
The European Council should restrict itself to giving general guidelines on European policy, as laid down in the Treaty.
We must re-evaluate the General Affairs Council, enabling it to resolve conflicts between the specialised Councils and ensuring that decisions are coherent.
To this end, it is essential to have a single channel for preparations, and the same single channel for preparations could also be used by the European Council.
We must demand that the ministers in the General Affairs Council do not deal with European affairs at a brief monthly meeting, where an in-depth discussion of the items on the agenda is not possible due to the limited number of ministers attending and the unacceptable practical conditions.
The proposal for a resolution suggests a number of practical solutions, which can all be implemented immediately without having to amend the Treaty.
Before I finish, I would like to draw the attention of Members to the proposals on improving collaboration with the European Parliament.
They concern the presence of Council ministers at our important debates as well as speeding up the legislative procedure from the first-reading stage.
With regard to transparency, I hope that the European Parliament and the Council will support the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which proposes that Council discussions be made public when it is working on legislation.
This obviously requires considerable reorganisation of the agenda and discipline in the conduct of meetings.
If the Council did not meet behind closed doors when carrying out its duties as co-legislator, citizens might also perceive it as a second legislative chamber, which is, in fact, a task that the Council already fulfils today.
Mr President, Mr Poos, ladies and gentlemen, I find myself in an awkward position here, since I have to take the floor as President of an institution which, according to Mr Poos, is the most badly organised of all those in the European Union.
Therefore, the task is, without doubt, fraught with danger.
You are right in thinking that the Presidency was very interested to read Mr Poos' report on Council reform.
Mr Poos has had a remarkable political career spent in many European forums and is consequently well acquainted with them, both internally, having been a participant, and externally, having observed them from a critical standpoint.
That being the case, I would like to say that the Presidency fully supports the analysis, perhaps not the description, but the analysis stating that we need to improve the way in which the Council is run.
The Helsinki European Council of June 1999 has already acknowledged that substantial changes in the Council' s working methods are necessary, and pointed out that these changes must be gradually introduced from now on so that by the time of enlargement, the Council can smoothly accommodate a larger membership.
The same Council also approved operational recommendations to achieve this.
The main thrust of these recommendations is very similar to some of the proposals made in Mr Poos' report. I shall mention just a few.
The recommendations stressed, therefore, that the main task of the European Council should be to provide the necessary impetus for the Union' s development and to define general political guidelines.
They emphasised that the General Affairs Council is responsible for overall coordination.
There was also a call to improve coordination of European policy within Member States.
The recommendations stressed that the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) has responsibility for the final preparation and presentation of all agenda items to the Council.
The final recommendation was to restrict the number of formations of the Council.
These recommendations, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, were implemented in parallel.
By way of example, the General Affairs Council has therefore followed the practice recommended at Helsinki, to divide its agenda accordingly into two parts: external relations issues and horizontal questions, which include overall policy coordination.
The General Affairs Council has also reduced the number of formations of the Council to sixteen, in order to improve the coherence of work, and to prevent fragmentation of the EU' s activities.
The role of COREPER was clarified in the Council' s internal rules of procedure.
Public debates are now organised on new and important legislative proposals, and on the programme of the General Affairs Council and the ECOFIN Council.
The first assessment regarding the implementation of the Helsinki recommendations was presented by the Council' s Secretary-General at the Gothenburg European Council in June 2001.
From this, it emerged that progress has been made, but a great deal still needs to be done.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, certain measures were, for example, not completely implemented.
The European Council of Gothenburg gave explicit recognition to this and pointed out, as the Secretary-General underlines in his report, that other reforms for the Council' s structures and working methods are needed.
In the light of this, the Secretary-General was requested to formulate specific proposals for measures, preferably during the European Council of Laeken, which must guarantee the effective operation of the Council following enlargement, by means of better preparation for council meetings, clear coordination between the different council formations and more efficient working methods, so as to enable the Council to take the necessary decisions by June 2002.
Meanwhile, the Belgian Presidency will continue to implement the Helsinki recommendations.
Parallel with this, the General Affairs Council has intensified its coordinating role.
For example, from now on, the presidency will report to the General Affairs Council on the most important dossiers which are being discussed in the other Council formations.
This list is drawn up so as to allow the General Affairs Council to carry out fully its horizontal coordination role pertaining to all activities of the different formations of the Council.
The object of this exercise is to make the Council activities in its different formations more coherent, and to ensure that these are better tailored to the general objectives of the Union.
Furthermore, this also reinforces the role of the General Affairs Council in the context of the preparation of the European Council.
Additionally, recent events in the United States have clearly illustrated that overall coordination of the Union' s activities in the fight against terrorism is necessary.
The General Affairs Council of 17 October looked into a report of the presidency on the activities of the different formations of the Council in this field.
With this report, the presidency has drawn up a roadmap comprising all Council initiatives and activities, each time indicating those responsible for the implementation, the deadlines and the progress made to date.
The General Affairs Council has asked for regular updates of this roadmap.
After all, this is an important instrument which enables progress to be evaluated for each formation of the Council.
During its next sitting on 29 October, the General Affairs Council will once again pour over this updated roadmap.
This initiative clearly illustrates the capacity of the General Affairs Council, if necessary, to guarantee general coordination of the Council' s policy.
Furthermore, this initiative should help re-confirm this coordinating role of the Council in general.
Needless to say, there are other reforms needed to improve the operation of the Council.
There is no doubt that the report requested from the Secretary-General will, therefore, prove useful in generating further thoughts on this issue. And that also applies, of course, to the report by Mr Poos and the EP resolution.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, I would also like to say that, with regard to the dysfunctions in the Council, the Commission widely supports the analysis presented in this excellent report.
Personally, I am not surprised by the quality of this analysis, given the experience and expertise that Mr Poos has gained over many long years and which he is now putting to use at the European Parliament.
I would like to say that, having begun by voicing our overall appreciation of the report, the Commission also supports the reforms that you put forward for the Council.
Transforming the Council into a structured and efficient body is in the interests of the whole European Union.
Your report takes up many of the suggestions and comments that we at the Commission have expressed in the past, and particularly in our recently published White Paper on European Governance.
These options for reform are all the more interesting since they can be made - as you have said - without altering the current Treaty.
With reference to the Council, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would obviously like to say that, from my point of view, each of our institutions is autonomous and has primary responsibility for its own reforms.
We know very well, however, that each of the institutions is concerned with how they all function.
It is in this spirit and within these boundaries that I would like to give you the European Commission' s impression of the other institution, in other words, the Council of Ministers.
Admittedly, within the framework of the debate on the future of the European Union, we must carry out an in-depth examination of the institutional set-up, the role of each institution and the amendments that need to be made to the Treaty so that our Union has a genuine institutional framework that is both more democratic and more effective.
That is why I think, Mr Poos, that your report is an extremely important element, which will spark off the wide-ranging debate about to open on the institutional framework of the EU, its effectiveness and its democratic legitimacy.
Nonetheless, the debate on the most fundamental reforms in the run-up to 2004 cannot be an excuse for refusing to immediately adopt the reforms that the Council can already implement in the existing Treaty. Furthermore, one of the objectives set out in the White Paper is to ensure the Council functions as efficiently as possible.
Apart from the different views that might be expressed on one point of detail or another, there is some convergence on the analysis of the dysfunctions that we have found - and of the reforms that need to be carried out.
This convergence is evident in the report that you are presenting, Mr Poos, in the White Paper and also - as Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck stated - in the Trumpf-Piris report, which was drawn up by the General Secretariat of the Council itself. The operational conclusions of this report were widely approved at Helsinki by the European Council and were also widely implemented in the Council' s internal rules of procedure.
It falls within the remit and it is the duty of each institution - I would like to reiterate this - to continually examine whether that institution is working efficiently.
The Commission wanted to do this by adopting the White Paper and proposing the administrative reform drawn up by my colleague, Neil Kinnock.
I believe that the Council will have to do this one day, as will the European Parliament, and the Commission will do all it can to support these two institutions in this undertaking.
In this respect, I would like to reiterate that the Gothenburg European Council has already asked the Secretary-General of the Council to submit detailed proposals on this issue for the meeting at Laeken.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise - without going into the details of each proposal in your report, Mr Poos, that all we need is political will to successfully complete this assessment and improvement work.
Obviously, this must be shown by the Member States governments as well as by the institutions themselves.
There are at least two points that deserve particular attention. On the one hand, the concept of the legislative Council and, on the other, the role of the General Affairs Council.
We are well aware, ladies and gentlemen, that the Poos report defines the three functions of the Council, which are to legislate, to take decisions regarding government and to coordinate policies.
Consequently it is very clear - and the Commission supports this - that the Council must be organised differently so that it operates within the framework of one or another of these three functions.
Therefore, the legislative Council should basically work in complete transparency, with open debates and public votes.
Admittedly, the number of sectoral Councils may be too high, but it is primarily the lack of coordination between these sectoral Councils, which means that, unlike the European Parliament, in which the Assembly takes the final decision, the Council arm of the legislator has much more difficulty in coordinating its various decisions.
This situation calls for particular consideration of how determined we are - as you mentioned in the report - to encourage consensus between Parliament and the Council from the first-reading stage within the codecision procedure.
Mr Poos, although the Commission fully supports the determination to bring about swift agreements, we must ensure that they do not have a negative effect on the coherence of texts that the Commission proposes.
Under the Treaties, the Commission has the exclusive right of initiative and the responsibility of protecting the common interest.
The Commission therefore hopes that the determination of Parliament and the Council to bring about consensus at first reading ensures that the Commission will be fully involved in all aspects regarding substance and procedure, in order to guarantee this coherence in the texts adopted.
I would like to reiterate that the Commission has been given the exclusive competence to hand down a judgment to protect the common interest at this stage of the codecision procedure.
You are also quite right, Mr Poos, when you point out in the report that the crux of the debate is, essentially, how the General Affairs Council functions.
It is extremely difficult, in just one monthly meeting, to take decisions on all the issues relating to EU external policy, including those on security policy, on maintaining the single institutional framework of the European Union and all the horizontal and institutional issues, such as, for example, the recent regulation on access to documents or the coordination of the EU response to the tragic events of 11 September, as well as coordinating sectoral policies.
The Commission is fairly well placed to judge the degree of variation in the subjects dealt with by the General Affairs Council, as there are times when we require several Commissioners to represent us at the same session.
We therefore support your view, Mr Poos: the various formations in the Council need a central body responsible for coordination and, at the moment, it is very difficult for the General Affairs Council to do this.
We must therefore avoid a situation where the General Affairs Council becomes some sort of Foreign Affairs Council, because there is no other formation in charge of coordination.
Furthermore, is it necessary to create a new General Affairs Council, made up of ministers who fulfil a coordinating role within their governments and who wield the necessary political authority, as you suggest?
This would, in any case, enable the European Council to be freed from arbitration and from policy coordination, so that it can fully devote itself to its real job of providing political impetus and defining guidelines for the European Union.
However, creating this sort of Council raises a whole raft of political, even constitutional, issues, as you yourself admit, in some Member States, particularly in those that have a coalition government.
To sum up, Mr President, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to thank Mr Poos once again for the extensive, excellent and very thorough piece of work that he has done and for the useful proposals contained in the report.
Quite frankly, I do not believe that it is the Commission' s role to respond to one or another detailed comment regarding the way the Council functions because, as I have said, each of our institutions, quite naturally, functions autonomously.
This, however, does not prevent us from performing a global assessment where there are no taboo subjects, to repeat the phrase that Mr Verhofstadt used this morning, when he stated that there were no taboo subjects where the wide-ranging debate and the Laeken Declaration are concerned.
The issue of how to improve collaborative work, particularly in the field of legislation, is not a taboo subject either.
The Commission would like to say that it is also in its interests to work with an efficient Council and that the two messages contained in this own-initiative report, in other words, that we must guarantee coherent action as well as a certain level of political representation in the Council' s decision-making, have certainly been heard, Mr Poos.
Thank you.
Mr President, Mrs Neyts, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, our group thanks the rapporteur, Mr Poos, for his report.
Our colleagues in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, led by our coordinator, Mr Méndez de Vigo, have, of course, been committed to supporting his work.
This report, though, sets alarm bells ringing.
When the report observes - an observation that I welcome, although I regret its accuracy - that the coordinating role of the General Affairs Council has been undermined, the Commission's right to take initiatives weakened and, finally, government-level cooperation in Council built up to the detriment of cooperation at Community level, then that is cause for alarm as regards the Council's ability to operate.
The Foreign Ministers, who at present constitute the General Affairs Council, can no longer perform this duty adequately.
They travel around the world - which is after all what they are meant to do - spend a few hours in the Council, leave their deputies to represent them and are not there for the vote anyway.
That is why the Council should, for once, take its Rules of Procedure, more specifically Article 11(4), seriously and check how many Ministers are actually present at the concluding votes.
We need, then, a new General Affairs Council.
Let us call it a Council of European Ministers, meeting weekly, or more often if necessary, in Brussels or, of course, in the national capitals, and always available within their governments.
We also insist on something to which Commissioner Barnier has referred, namely that the Legislative Council which meets in public to decide on laws - not in committees, but in final rulings - needs to be separated from the Executive Council.
I hope we will reach the point where this can be established and that a Council of European Ministers - as I wish to call it for the sake of simplicity - conceived along these lines, will also be able to coordinate the work of the various Councils.
Some of their voting procedures are utterly different, and the European Council must then again be asked to give authority to the Council, so that the ladies and gentlemen can deal with the matter again.
Things must change!
I would like to address one point which is not particularly topical but is intended to point the way ahead.
It concerns the need to find a successor to occupy Mr Hombach's position.
I recommend that we should not appoint a sort of Hombach Mark II to this position, not because I have anything against Mr Hombach, but because, in institutional terms, we need to go in a new direction.
I think these duties should find a home at the Commission, so that the Commission, which has the Budget resources at its disposal, can also take responsibility for these issues...
(Applause)
.... so that we can eventually achieve the transfer of the High Representative's functions to the remit of the Commission, where a Vice-President would take them over.
(Applause)
Please let me make a final observation, which is not directed at my esteemed colleague Mr Poos: I hope that the present members of the Council have the strength and insight to come to the right decisions while they belong to the Council and not only after becoming honourable Members of this European Parliament.
(Applause)
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have asked to speak in this debate firstly in order to express my personal gratitude and that of my group to Mr Poos for his wonderful report.
It really is a piece of work carried out with knowledge of the subject, not only because he is a veteran of the Council, but because I witnessed perfectly, ten years ago when we were preparing the Treaty of Maastricht, how Mr Poos, then a member of the Council with the government of Mr Santer, along with Mr Santer, showed the same attitude of openness, cooperation and solidarity towards Parliament which he is now proposing in his report.
The result was the Treaty of Maastricht, which gave us codecision.
I believe that we must salute his coherent and serious political track record.
With regard to codecision, we are not just dealing with a reform of the Council as such, but we are an interested party in the matter.
Codecision has allowed us to develop a shared culture in which the Council, for the first time, has been opening up to Parliament.
We must consolidate this.
There is a very important step proposed by the Poos report, which is that the Council, in legislative session, should act publicly.
If there is an insufficient number of Ministers, they could apply the rule applied by Parliament: that votes should be nominal, and if members are not present, they should not be paid allowances.
These are therefore measures which can be applied straight away and which do not have to await the reform.
From this point of view, I believe that Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, whose path has taken the opposite course, having moved on from Parliament to the Council, can introduce a degree of freshness into the work of the Council.
I hope she can cooperate with us.
A final observation, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen: we are on the eve of the Convention; we have fought for it in Parliament and we believe that we also have to cooperate positively in the process of reforming our institutions, which are interdependent on each other, in a way which means that we cannot reform one without taking account of the others.
In conclusion, I believe that we have to teach by example.
We are awaiting the Council meeting on the 30 October, from which we want a unanimous position from the Council with regard to the Belgian proposal on taxation, in order to bring about the statute of Members once and for all; we also believe that the package of anti-terrorist measures is a great opportunity to demonstrate to our co-citizens that we are united. And lastly, the President-in-Office of the Council will allow me to point out that we would like her, with a view to Laeken, between the White Paper on Governance and the Mandelkern report, which is with the Council, to present us with a coherent proposal which is not based on a reduction of Parliament' s legislative powers.
That would also help the reform.

Mr President, just as the Commission and we in Parliament change our methods of working, the former through its White Paper, the Council too must of course change its own methods of working, both in the light of enlargement and because, as many people point out, its present methods do not work so well at present.
Mr Poos has much long-standing experience of how the Council operates. I hope that the Council will take his views on board.
I assume that this issue will come up at the convention and that, as Mr Verhofstadt said this morning, there will be no taboos.
Precisely what shape is to be taken by the Council' s work is not of course something we Liberals have any reason for taking a view on, because it is not our task to regulate these matters.
There are nonetheless certain issues in which we think we can become involved.
Transparency is one such issue.
For us, transparency in the EU' s work is important when it comes to all the institutions.
It is a key to winning back people' s confidence in the European project.
At present, the Council meets behind closed doors and legislates for millions upon millions of Europeans.
That is not acceptable.
Everyone talks about this, and everyone criticises it.
Very minor reforms take place, but these are not enough.
The legislation must be a matter for public debate.
A separate department must be formed within the Council in which the ministers meet entirely openly and in public in order to legislate.
There must, moreover, be proper Minutes issued afterwards.
The members of this legislative Council must of course be politicians, not officials, with clear mandates from their respective governments.
Another issue which worries us rather, and which Mr Poos also addressed, is that of all the overhyped 'mini-summits' which assume an enormous amount of importance.
A great many decisions are made during these meetings of rather doubtful status.
We hope that less emphasis will be placed on these meetings and that they will instead be transformed into working meetings.
There is an increased tendency in the Council - not so much in the country that at present holds the Presidency, but in many others, especially Sweden - towards intergovernmental activity and a desire to strengthen the Council at Parliament' s and the Commission' s expense.
We view this development with great concern, because more intergovernmental activity and more decisions behind closed doors scarcely lead to a more democratic EU.
Mr President, during a meeting last Saturday, I happened to hear a new colleague of an important minister describing, with the frankness of a newcomer, his first experience of a Council of Ministers. He said that it was a sort of Barnum Circus, where everyone talks but hardly anyone listens or actually seeks agreement.
We support the rapporteur and the majority of his proposals, and so I would like to use the time available to me to send two messages from our group to the Council, in particular.
The first is that, even if the Council were to approve Parliament' s proposals tomorrow morning, we would not be able to resolve the fundamental democratic imbalance and we would not be able to stop the intergovernmental drift.
The only way to genuinely improve the democracy and efficiency of the Union is by strengthening the Commission and Parliament and removing the Council' s right of veto.
The second message is a call to reflect on what Commissioner Barnier has said, namely that despite the positive elements and the endeavours of the Belgian Presidency, it would currently be impossible to reform the Council without a grass roots debate among its members on the very nature of the Council.
I am sure that ideas vary among the Union' s Member States on the Council' s future, and I therefore call strongly upon the Presidency to assume responsibility for organising this debate on the future and to ensure that practical steps are taken which open up the way for rapid progress along the path outlined by Mr Poos, pending more comprehensive reforms.
Mr President, Mr Poos and the Commission' s gargantuan endeavours could be likened to those of an eagle which is eager but unable to take flight towards the future heights of the new European ambitions.
However, we must see this report as a positive contribution to the preparations for the future structure of the Union, a Union which must of necessity be an autonomous, independent political entity, secure in its cultural and social traditions, which can serve as an effective response to the confusion brought by a hegemony such as that we are currently witnessing.
The Union must assume a new role. In a situation in which alliances are being disbanded and reformed on a global scale, Europe comes across as weak, appointing dubious triumvirates to represent it on the world stage when it needs to be united and firmly autonomous in presenting and maintaining a line of peace and social justice to eradicate the threat of terrorism.
The reforms proposed by the Poos report are necessary and achievable, and we support them.
These are small but important steps, worthy of due consideration by the Council and Parliament. They will also contribute greatly to resolving the democratic deficit, endowing the Council with a new institutional role and a closer relationship with Parliament.
This fundamental political and external security action and its mandated representative can only be effective if decisions are taken in a context of joint responsibility between all the countries rather than with some of them being excluded.
The Council has to understand this. We are not just complaining for the sake of it: this is a democratic requirement for the well-structured, transparent running of the Union and will benefit the Union as a whole.
Mr President, I would like to say that I believe that both Parliament and the Commission are most fortunate in having somebody of the calibre of Mr Poos to give us this very fine report which is long overdue.
I very much welcome Mr Poos' report and very much hope that when it receives overwhelming support from Parliament, as I believe it will, the Belgian Presidency will convey the importance of the report to the Council of Ministers.
We hope also that the Belgian Presidency will lead the drive, as it were, to rock the consciences of the members of the General Affairs Council as to what their role and function must and should be.
Regrettably, the General Affairs Council has very much receded into the background in terms of its effectiveness.
The Council has been undermined by the expansion of specialised Councils and by the European Council itself and this is very regrettable.
The General Affairs Council, as Mr Poos says, must remain a powerful political body and it must not be allowed to become a super Coreper.
If it does, nobody will have an overall view of what is happening; where we should go and how we are to prepare for the future.
The work of the Council must be more consistent, and greater coordination is needed in the administration of the Council.
I feel the Council should confine itself to defining the general political guidelines of the Union and should not intervene in the questions of specific detail.
It is very much in the interests of better decision-making within the Union to have an effective Council which is transparent and exercises all the duties conferred upon it by the Treaty.
Also, Ministers who attend the General Affairs Council meetings must have all the powers required to carry out their tasks.
We are all too familiar with Ministers appearing at General Affairs Council meetings, taking the television cameras on the way in with their one or two one-liners and then going on their way.
The Belgian Presidency-in-Office shakes her head in disbelief.
Madame, I know, I was there!
I saw it for myself on more than one occasion and things have not improved since I left.
In actual fact, they have got much worse, and that is something that must be aired.
We want the General Affairs Council to do its business.
We would like the Presidency for the time being to do its business and we also want the Commission to do its business.
We respect, and must respect, the three institutions and the role that they have to play.
This Parliament cannot afford to sit back and be silent if we see the role of any one of the institutions, be it Parliament or the Commission or, indeed the Council, being sidelined for any particular reason by any small group of Member States for any political reasons they may have at any time.
Mr President, who knows the Ministers Mr Van Dale, Mr Conde de Saro and Mr Christoffersen?
These three gentlemen will, over the next 14 months, be responsible for the adoption of the majority of laws in the EU.
The permanent representatives of the countries which hold, or are to hold, the presidency - Belgium, Spain and Denmark - are clever diplomats who live in the shadows.
They meet every week in Brussels and negotiate the larger part of our laws.
Seventy per cent of these are prepared by their subordinates and aides.
Fifteen per cent of them they deal with themselves.
Another 15% are placed on the ministers' desks, and the permanent representatives brief or deputise for the ministers during the formal adoption.
The meetings take place behind sealed doors so that no one can see how far we are from that democracy in which we are united in believing in the fifteen Member States.
It does happen that a matter is discussed in public and finds echoes in the national parliaments. Indeed, it may directly entail a brief or negotiating mandate for the minister.
However, that is the exception. As a rule, we as voters and elected representatives have forfeited the larger part of our democracy, which is administered by 15 permanent representatives and their officials.
The solution to this democratic deficit or embezzlement, for we know, of course, who have absconded with the power, is simple: to read our constitutions and return legislative power to the elected representatives.
Let us recreate the core of democracy whereby the electorate can go to the polls and new majorities can be obtained and new laws adopted.
That core does not exist in today' s EU.
Mr President, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, ladies and gentlemen, we could actually say that we have had a stroke of luck.
The day after one of the worst spectacles that the European Union and, in particular, its Council of Ministers has ever provided to the citizens of Europe, the excellent report by Mr Poos, the former chairman of the Council of Ministers, appears, which not only shows us the way forward - it gives an outline that should be displayed on all the churches or public buildings in the European Union, just like the theses used to be posted on the Wittemburg church.
We have witnessed a European Council, where the dispersal of the institutions, the dispersal of the Council, split up into asides, factions and the most diverse formations, had a detrimental effect on the work of the Belgian Presidency, which did nothing to cause this of course. Now we are reiterating the great principles and calmly and dispassionately saying how Europe should be run, and where it is failing, because we are not applying the wise recommendations and thoughts of Mr Poos, which are also enhanced by his years of experience, of someone who has an insider' s view of the Council of Ministers, and of the European Council full stop.
I therefore think that the vote on this report is a great moment for Parliament.
Unfortunately, Europe in practice does not provide any inspiration at all, which is one of the main reasons why the work of the EU, the image of the EU and the weight of the EU are insufficient.
Therefore, if this text can be an element that the Belgian Presidency, in the run-up to the Laeken Summit and the Laeken Declaration, may largely take into consideration by saying 'ladies and gentlemen, this is the way forward, this is the Community method and this is how things should be run, so that at least we are trying to put our house in order' , then this text will be worthwhile, and I hope it will receive Parliament' s unanimous approval tomorrow.
In any case, the radical Members will support it unreservedly.
We think that this is the way forward, that this is how we get there, that we must see European integration and not European destruction, which is, unfortunately, what the Council all too often gives us the impression is being allowed to happen. It is not really the Council itself, but its members, its actors, who certainly demonstrated at Ghent, as they did at Nice, that they are very capable of breaking up the institutions, and that they are actively working towards this goal.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Poos and point out that all the institutions of the European Union will have to re-orientate themselves and find better ways of working in view of the challenges being presented to them, the enlargement of the European Union and the changes which will come about simply because of the number of people involved.
The Commission has for some time been pressing on with this sort of internal reform process.
The European Parliament is occupied in creating the same sort of conditions by means of the Corbett report, which is currently in progress, provided we can achieve these without amendments to the Treaties becoming necessary.
I believe this should be done by both these institutions and also by the Council, which will have the greatest problems simply by reason of the increase in the number of its members.
For when I consider that in future, when there are 27 members at a meeting of the European Council, it will take an hour and a half simply to deal with the precedence of delegations and then that the statements made by every delegation will make even lunch difficult - and of course we cannot go without lunch - then it clearly does not go without saying that we will be able to work effectively.
This has nothing to do with the effectiveness of a Council Presidency, but exclusively with the structures.
That is why it is extraordinarily important that we really do tackle many of Mr Poos' proposals in this area, which can be realised by simple amendments to the Rules of Procedure and without Treaty amendments.
I believe we have to do this for two reasons, namely to increase efficiency and for the sake of greater transparency.
Efficiency can only be increased by the burden of the General Council no longer having to be borne by one pair of hands and in the context of one organisation.
Meeting up constitutes Item A, we do a bit of foreign policy, then all 27 of us meet the President of Kazakhstan, then move on to Item B, which is legislation, and all this with seamless transitions from one item to the next, so that half the participants are always in a press conference.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I may be exaggerating a bit, but I fear that the reality is rather like that in some areas.
It would in fact be necessary, for this reason, to move over to an Executive Council concentrating on foreign policy in particular.
We really should be in a position to formulate a coherent foreign policy in the Council, provided that it is an intergovernmental organisation, and must make it clear that one effect of transparency will be a Legislative Council whose votes will be publicly taken and publicly explained.
We will only win people' s acceptance of Europe if they know who took what decision and for what reason.
That is a fundamental issue when it comes to gaining our citizens' acceptance, and only in this way can we, by means of the codecision procedure, bring about the public interaction of Parliament and the Council, so that the citizen and the media have the chance to reach a fair judgment and hold to account those who are responsible, or believed to be responsible, for wrong decisions.
I believe it to be urgently necessary that the work should be made parliamentary in this way and that this should be the means by which it is also made political.
We are engaged in the work of legislation, which in many fields is regulated by officials who share in the decisions.
I find it hard to reconcile this with our democratic conceptions and so I would like to ask you to take the initiative on this point in Laeken, because we can achieve a great deal without amending the Treaty and should also be preparing ourselves in this way for enlargement of the European Union.
Mr President, the Poos report is audacious, cautious and realistic.
Audacious because it immediately proposes a set of amendments to improve the workings of the Council.
Cautious because it acknowledges the viability of the amendments without needing to modify the Treaties.
And realistic because it recognises that it is also becoming politically necessary to make considerable improvements to the workings of both the Commission and Parliament.
The report' s proposals even consider the idea that improving the institutional workings of the Union will require major adjustments to the balance of established power which, without endangering the workings of these bodies, guarantee the full participation of all Member States.
I would say, as a matter of fact, that this is the fundamental issue.
The broad objectives for the European Union in economic, social and security terms and for its external representation will only be achieved in the short term if Europe as a whole, through its various public opinions, and the fifteen Member States, through their representatives in the various bodies, attach priority and urgency to improving political cohesion on the basis of fully egalitarian participation.
Passivity, a lack of clear definition, division and disputes between countries, which prevent changes from taking place, help maintain the status quo, prove right those who see the European Union as nothing more than a group of merchants whose primary concern is to divide up the limited financial resources it has available in a way that is not always fair or equitable.
Strengthening the institutions, improving their workings and efficiency, drafting and producing Community policies for security and for our external representation is absolutely essential, but this must be carried out by all fifteen Member States without exceptions and without cabinets.
For this reason, the report warrants our support and our admiration.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are debating today is an intelligent and creditable attempt by Mr Poos to reform the Council without changing the Treaties.
I congratulate the rapporteur on his efforts although I cannot share his optimism.
I do not believe that this mini-reform can solve the problems of the Council nor do I see the political will to carry it out, unfortunately.
I hope that I am wrong and Mr Poos is right.
Mr President, the golden age of the General Affairs Council has passed and it seems unrealistic to believe that the European Council is prepared to reinstate the powers which it has taken away from it.
European policies are not external policies but internal policies of the Member States and the important decisions must not be reserved for the Foreign Affairs Ministers.
They already have enough to do with the common foreign and security policy.
The institutional triangle is still essential to the good functioning of the Union, provided that each of its elements continues to adapt to the new requirements.
In the case of the Council, we are facing a quagmire whose deficiencies can only be remedied: a) by recognising the decisive role of the European Council; b) by giving the General Affairs Council the task of effectively preparing its decisions so that they are not relegated to national bureaucracies; and c) by organising all the specialised Councils into an efficiently-structured system.
This efficiency will not be achieved without abandoning the now obsolete system of a rotating six-monthly Presidency, replacing it with a longer-lasting Presidency.
Effective political action cannot change its priorities every six months.
My group raised this issue in the debate of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, although, out of respect for the focus of the report, we do not insist on this point.
The Poos report has the merit of proposing to the Council some minimal reforms, which are likely to lead to a process of self-reform which is becoming increasingly essential.
I would be pleased if it achieved that objective at least.
We would all gain from this, even those of us who believe that Council reforms can only be achieved by the Convention because they need to be far more in-depth.
Mr President, every single pronouncement by the European Parliament expresses our faith in democracy, transparency and efficiency.
And quite rightly so. However, it is not enough.
These general principles only acquire substance and translate into practice if they permeate the organisational structure of the entire European Union.
Which is precisely why we should welcome Jacques Poos' motion for a resolution.
It is one of the most important texts to pass through the European Parliament.
The rapporteur demonstrates that a great deal can be done in the area of both democracy and efficiency without revising the Treaties, merely by applying them more accurately.
Taking the report as my starting point, I should at least like to highlight the following: first, the way in which the Council is organised is so complicated, with its 27 sectoral formations which have a fragmentary effect on its work.
It addresses individual trees, but rarely the wood as a whole.
The General Affairs Council should meet more frequently, but with the ministers present, not just in Brussels but, if possible, at the meetings too.
If the Council is to work, national administrations and governments need to adapt to the European institutional attitude and modus operandi.
As for relations between the Council and the European Parliament, there is good cause to increase the numbers of days' presence, although personal appearances in Parliament by the President-in-Office of the Council and transparency do not necessarily mean that the Council has to be reformed.
Finally, I note that the Europe issue has increased the volume of work and deserves greater attention.
The members of the Council need to make a reasonable division between their national and European duties if they are to make a more effective contribution.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, in turn, should like to congratulate Jacques Poos on the excellent report which he has presented to the House and to thank him for the highly democratic manner in which he dealt with the proposals and observations of the other members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, observations intended to improve the report.
I should like to comment on three points in the report which I consider extremely important.
The first is item 9, which refers to the Council's two areas of work, namely the legislative and the executive.
I think that Mr Poos is quite right to say that a distinction must be made between the legislative Council, that is, it must be clear when the Council is acting in a legislative capacity and when it is acting in an executive capacity.
This is extremely important and, I think, needs to be borne in mind.
The second point concerns collaboration between the Council and the European Parliament.
It would be unfair to the Council not to say that certain steps have been taken, but that does not mean that more are not needed.
I should like to comment on two paragraphs in Mr Poos' proposals which I think are very important.
The first is paragraph 18, which refers to the role and the relations which the High Representative for the CFSP should have with Parliament.
I should like to ask the Council to bring Mr Solana to order.
The High Representative needs to learn that his relations with Parliament come within a certain framework and are governed by certain rules which he would do well to understand. The second paragraph is Paragraph 19.
I was delighted at the excellent example set by the Belgian presidency this morning, when the President-in-Office of the Council reported to the European Parliament in person, and I should like to congratulate Mr Verhofstadt for this morning.
The third point, which I think is very important, is the huge issue of transparency.
It is an issue which concerns all the institutional bodies of the European Union.
It has been raised by other Members, such as Mrs Malmström, who has done an excellent job on the issue of transparency, as, of course, has Mrs Maij-Weggen, but what I want to say to the Council is that European citizens are not just interested in what the Council decides; they are far more interested in why it decides what it does.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council functions poorly, which is also bad news for all the other EU institutions.
It is bad for Parliament and it is bad for the Commission.
The lack of transparency and efficiency, which have often been referred to here, also affect our work and give us a bad image in the eyes of the EU's citizens.
That is why reform of the Council is urgently necessary, as must be emphasised again and again.
Mr Poos has produced useful and valuable suggestions as to how such a reform might now be possible without the need for a new European Treaty.
I share the view that people have a right to know who votes and which way when it comes to laws and regulations that affect their daily lives.
The Legislative Council urgently needs this public character.
I do not believe that the number of Councils on various sectors is the problem.
The problem is the deficient coordination within the Council and also within the governments of the Member States.
Changes must be made here.
I believe we must follow up this idea of sending a permanent minister to Brussels who would take over the coordination of government policy at national level.
On Monday, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs added further items to the agenda, for example, the issue of the Council Presidency when there are at least twenty-five Member States, or also how the European Council is to be defined.
What is that?
An organ, a super-board, or is it part of the Council?
This reform is urgently needed, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, and we hope that you can do something even before Laeken, and that, in Laeken, the Council will again be on the agenda with a view to the future Treaty on the Union.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Poos for this report on the much-needed Council reforms.
We sometimes say in connection with the Pope that there is no need to be married to be able to talk about marriage.
However, in the case of Mr Poos, we can say that he has every right to talk about the Council as he has formed part of it for a very long time.
How badly the Council functions at crucial moments was evident at the Ghent Summit where three Prime Ministers had made prior arrangements outside of the Council, where the President of the Council made essential statements on the evaluation of the attacks on Afghanistan which were subsequently not backed by the Council, where various Prime Ministers made various statements following the European Summit, where decisions were taken on a payment issue of banks in relation to the euro, but where no decisions were made on crucial anti-terrorist measures proposed by the Commission and Parliament and where, to cap it all, an embarrassing dispute arose between the President of the Council and the President of the Commission.
That is how the Council comes across to the public.
And that negative image dominates the entire decision-making process and the way the Union is viewed throughout the Union.
How can the Council be reformed in such a way as to ensure that the Union functions better and to improve the Council' s image with the citizen?
How can the Council be reformed in such a way as to ensure that the Union' s entire institutional structure is more democratic and open?
In my opinion, a few factors are of crucial significance in this.
First of all, the Council must confine itself to its original brief, namely to express the view of the Member State governments, under the supervision of the national parliaments and the European Parliament.
Secondly, the Council must coordinate its tasks more effectively, thus ensuring that the General Affairs Council and the joint committees speak with one voice.
In my view, the number of joint committees could be cut down even further.
Thirdly, the General Affairs Council should function far more forcefully on the basis of solid positions of national members of government for European affairs, preferably in the capacity of Minister.
Belgium set a good example in this connection.
Fourthly, where legislation and the budget are concerned, all Council meetings should be public, which means that both discussions and decision-making should take place in public and reports that are compiled on these should also be made public.
Fifthly, in the case of legislation, including the budget, only ministers should be granted a right to vote, which means that it is not acceptable for them to be replaced by, for example, the permanent representative or by officials.
In my opinion, the Council should function entirely in line with its actual task as a Federal Council, much like its German model, so that it becomes crystal clear to the citizens what its role is in the democratic process of the Union.
I truly hope that the report by Mr Poos will play a key role in the forthcoming IGC and above all, I hope that the Council will take to heart what has been expressed here in Parliament in the way of criticism, but also the odd word of praise.
Mr President, people have a right to know how their representatives in government have acted and voted in the Council.
It is entirely unacceptable in a democracy for laws to be made behind closed and bolted doors on behalf of 380 million people and without there being any public scrutiny.

The most important position adopted in the European Parliament' s report on Council reform is therefore to be found in Paragraph 26, concerning the need for openness and stating the European Parliament' s request that, when the Council acts as legislator, both the deliberations and the votes should be in the public domain, as well as Parliament' s particular request that, at the beginning and end of all legislative procedures, public debates be held in accordance with Rule 8 of the Council' s Rules of Procedure and that Rule 9(1) of the Council' s Rules of Procedure be implemented.
It also states that the results of votes and the explanations of vote referring to legislative texts must be published.
Through this future openness, the European Union will be democratised.
It will lead to greater pressure being exercised by electorates and to greater supervision of the Council by national parliaments. It is about time!
In turn, that will lead to growing demands for a concentration of the EU' s tasks and the need to limit the EU' s powers of decision-making.
In other words, the report we are adopting today will have long-term consequences.
I believe that we are thus coming significantly nearer the objective formulated by former Commission President Jacques Santer in 1995: Do fewer things, but do them better.
Thank you very much, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m.
Preparations for the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on preparations for the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation.
Commissioner, Mr President, honourable MEPs, in two weeks' time, the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation will get underway in Doha, Qatar.
The European Union is making every effort to ensure that, on that occasion, a new trade round will commence on the basis of a broad and balanced agenda.
In this connection, the conclusions reached by the General Affairs Council on 26 October 1999 will remain a point of reference.
The General Affairs Council of 8 October has underlined the importance of a new trade round.
Next week' s General Affairs Council will once again examine the state of affairs.
It is indeed important for a strong and united Union to leave for Doha.
You all know, of course, that it is the Commission that negotiates in matters of trade on behalf of the European Union - as is the case here - and that Commissioner Lamy, who will be taking the floor after me, plays an absolutely crucial and, in any case, very valued role in this.
For your information, I should like to add that the topic of the preparation of the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation has also been discussed during the Social Affairs Council, the Agriculture Council, and, if I am not mistaken, this will also be done at the Environment Council, with a view to harmonising the positions, or at least, to being informed of the different sensitive issues.
A new round of broad-based negotiations must enable progress to be made in the further liberation and regulation of world trade, which is vital for a variety of reasons.
Firstly, the Conference will be taking place against a backdrop of a slowing down world economy, a situation which has been exacerbated by the tragic events of 11 September which are having a negative impact on economic growth in both the industrial and developing countries.
An agreement on the start of a new round will thus give the world economy a powerful and positive signal.
Even during the most recent informal Council in Ghent, the EU Heads of State and Government and the President of the Commission urged, and I quote: "to work actively towards launching of the WTO negotiations.
The current economic uncertainty means that trade liberalisation founded on a rules-based multilateral system and associated with a real development dimension is more important than ever, economically and politically" - end of quote.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a new round of trade negotiations is also extremely important for the developing countries.
The round must enable us to improve the integration of developing countries, and especially the least developed countries, into the multilateral trade system, particularly by providing better market access, through measures that facilitate the implementation of agreements that have already been reached, and also through measures that seek to make more operational the special and differential treatment given to these countries.
Thirdly, a new round will aim to strengthen the WTO rules-based system, by clarifying and explaining existing provisions, particularly with regard to trade and the environment, and by extending the WTO' s scope to new areas such as investment, competition and trade facilitation, so that the WTO adjusts to the needs that have come about due to changes in the global economy and so that it responds to the concerns arising from globalisation.
The European Union will also attempt to promote multilateral governance by ensuring increased coherence and improved cooperation of the WTO with other international organisations, particularly with the International Labour Organisation (ILO), in order to help to improve the way that globalisation is controlled.
(NL) I should like to underline that consequently, the European Union not only seeks to further liberalise world trade, it also seeks to further regulate world trade.
In fact, that reflects public opinion in the Member States perfectly.
Non-trade issues, further progress in terms of transparency of the World Trade Organisation mechanism, the preservation of the European model of government services and the special statute of those services are some of the interests which the European Union protects.
Together with the developing countries, a serious effort has been made over the past three years on the issue surrounding implementation.
That has made it possible to identify the relevant themes.
In some cases, these concern the application of the agreements, or a slight adjustment or interpretation of the text to be specified.
In other cases, these concern points which could well result in a formal change to the existing agreements.
All this slows down the process.
It is a process in which the European Union takes an active part, and is fully aware that this forms a key component for many countries.
I should like to point out that, alongside this effort involving the developing countries, an effort must also be made involving the so-called 'rich countries' which were originally, up until the beginning of this year, absolutely unconvinced - some more than others - of the fact that there is a real problem of implementation with regard to the developing countries.
(FR) Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for over a year, the European Union has played a central role in another important matter, namely trying to find a solution to enable the world' s poorest people to have proper and effective access to medicines.
The European Commission action plan in this area was approved by the General Affairs Council last May.
The European Union is working hard so that a clear statement on access to medicines and on the TRIPS agreement can be adopted at the Fourth Ministerial Conference at Doha.
Today, the WTO consultations are focusing on the draft Ministerial Declaration and on the draft decision on implementation-related issues.
Two documents, which were tabled on 26 September by Stuart Harbison, the Chairman of the WTO General Council.
Many of the WTO members consider these documents to be a good basis for our work, and they will be amended in line with the negotiations that have taken place since they were published.
As far as the European Union is concerned, the draft Ministerial Declaration will take into account a whole raft of subjects that we consider to be crucial.
The document still, however, falls short of expectations in several areas.
Commissioner Pascal Lamy will no doubt comment on this issue in his speech, and the Commission will continue to strive to ensure that the Ministerial Declaration responds to the European Union' s concerns and interests.
We are taking an active part in the negotiations on the agenda of the new round with an open and flexible approach, and we are also particularly concerned about assisting developing countries whilst protecting the legitimate aims and objectives of the European Union.
While the various components that will feature in the new round and the implementation-related issues form a whole, the final assessment by the Union will be based on both the overall balance and on the balance within the various subjects that will be discussed.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, by way of conclusion, I should like to say that the purport of the forthcoming Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation is to further adjust the regulating effect of world trade, and that this conference offers us a chance to give the world economy a considerable boost by commencing a new trade round.
Finally, I should like to underline the positive political and economic significance of such a round.
It aims to reinforce international solidarity, curb inequality and to enhance the stability of the world and the world economy.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the European Parliament for having organised this debate on the progress of preparations for the forthcoming Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation. There are two weeks to go before the conference opens and some lively discussions are now going on in Geneva and elsewhere on the negotiating programme that will be launched.
I would now like to say that, as negotiator for the European Union, it is very important to me that the European Parliament actively participates in this debate.
As you know, we fought together, at the previous Intergovernmental Conference - at which the Treaty of Nice, as we call it, was draw up - in order to enhance Parliament' s competences in the area of trade policy.
As you also know, the Member States did not adopt our proposals.
In these circumstances, the Commission is doing everything in its power, within the framework imposed on us by the Treaty, to inform the European Parliament and to involve it in the Union' s trade policy.
You also know that we are in favour of creating a consultative parliamentary body at the WTO, to enhance the role of Members in the multilateral trading system.
I am convinced that, if we want the support of public opinion, if we want to improve the WTO' s legitimacy, then enhancing the role of Members in the WTO' s work is not only possible, but also, and above all, it is necessary.
So, what is in the negotiating programme proposed by the European Union?
On several occasions over the last two years, since Seattle, we have had the opportunity to come together to discuss the progress of preparations for the forthcoming Ministerial Conference.
The exchanges of views that we have had here or in committee have given us food for thought as to which strategy should be applied.
The considerations and concerns that you have voiced during these meetings are very similar to those of the Commission.
Like us, you want a negotiating programme on the liberalisation of trade and investment, to meet the needs of our exporters and those of developing countries.
But, like us, you also want an agenda that focuses on the drafting of new rules, the clarification of current rules and the linking-up of World Trade Organisation rules and those of other international bodies in the areas of society, the environment, health or food safety.
It is these rules that will provide greater market efficiency, better social development and sufficient environmental protection.
We believe that the key to sustainable development of the planet as a whole hinges on our ability to combine the opening-up of the markets with the application of multilateral rules.
This is why there are three subjects on the agenda supported by the European Union since the Seattle meeting. These are market access, regulation and the integration of developing countries; the unity of these three subjects is guaranteed by what is called the single undertaking.
Lastly, we want to hold intense negotiations and come to swift conclusions.
Some may be surprised that the tragic events of 11 September have changed neither course nor our schedule.
I would like to briefly explain this.
Even before 11 September, we believed that an approach based on the principle of well-ordered liberalisation was required.
This has become even more necessary since the terrorist attacks took place.
The process of opening up markets, regulating trade, integrating developing countries and the concern to ensure environmental and social sustainability - we need these more now than ever before.
These are issues of stability and security, both in relations between countries and between generations.
Dialogue, negotiation and peaceful resolution to commercial conflicts have made international trade a laboratory for international governance, where each partner participates in decision-making.
Faced with the instability caused by the attacks, we must further strengthen the importance of the multilateral dimension, which we believe to be the best way to give today' s de facto globalisation a legal status.
Of course, the WTO is only one of the pillars making up a multilateral system, which must meet the challenges of globalisation.
A round of World Trade Organisation negotiations is therefore necessary, of course, but it is in no way sufficient.
We must also strengthen the other institutions of governance, the environment, social development, development funding and policy support agencies.
Let us now consider the prospects for the Ministerial Conference, which will take place in two weeks' time.
Generally speaking, I think that we are in a better position than we were at this stage before the Seattle conference.
The preparatory work is being carried out in a spirit of positive cooperation.
The belief that the multilateral system must now, more than ever, be an essential part of growth and prosperity is widely shared.
And I think we must also point out that the open, constructive spirit and the efforts made by many partners - such as ourselves, the United States, and an increasing number of developing countries - have already helped to partly reconcile the differing views that prevented Seattle from being a success.
This came across very clearly at the last informal select meeting of WTO trade ministers, which was held in Singapore on 13 and 14 October and which I attended.
I feel that this was also correctly reflected at the meeting of APEC trade ministers (Pacific-rim countries) that took place last week.
I think that we have now reached a point where we can envisage an ambitious, balanced round that meets the primary objectives of the European Union.
Of course, we have not yet achieved this goal.
We are now entering the final and crucial stage, in the run-up to Doha.
As you know, a draft Ministerial Declaration, which will constitute the framework of negotiations for the new round, was published on 26 September 2001.
All the members of the WTO considered this document to be a sound basis for moving forward.
Of course, no one was fully satisfied, which, if you are familiar with the culture at the WTO, is more or less a good sign prior to negotiations.
Obviously, not everything in this document is acceptable, not even for us, and I shall outline to you the main areas of difficulty, which require further work.
The first difficulty concerns trade and the environment, areas that give us particular cause for concern due to the lack of ambitious proposals.
Clearly, we hope to make the framework for negotiation much more substantial.
Progress is being made in some areas, but we must admit that most of our partners in developing countries are still hesitant, to say the least, about the idea of accepting negotiations on this subject.
We shall do everything we can in the following days to improve this situation.
I also made it clear to my colleagues, in Singapore, that a framework on this issue was not only a political necessity for the European Union, but should also be of interest to all the members of the World Trade Organisation and of the multilateral system as a whole.
I think that the message concerning the political importance that this question holds for us has got through.
We still need to draw operational consequences from this.
The second difficulty, after environment, is agriculture, which is still a very sensitive subject.
The draft declaration before us seems to pre-empt the outcome of the negotiations in several respects, since it aims, in particular, to phase out subsidy categories, which goes further than the framework that Franz Fischler and myself received...
Mr Lamy, I must ask you to interrupt your speech.
As you will all, of course, understand, this is an exercise in evacuating the Parliament building.
We shall adjourn the sitting and leave the Chamber immediately.
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to follow the instructions given by Parliament' s security staff calmly and orderly, and to leave by the emergency exits.
This sitting is now adjourned, and will resume as soon as the bells indicate that work can be resumed as normal.
(The sitting was interrupted at 16.35 due to a fire drill and resumed at 17.10)
Mr President, I shall carry on with what I was saying before this brief interruption, which is that the draft statement for the Doha Conference, currently on the table, raises a number of issues with regard to the environment and agriculture, and now I shall talk about the social aspect.
We are not completely satisfied with some aspects of the statement either, specifically with the way it deals with the social domain.
We feel that it is treated too sparingly and should be extended to more appropriately reflect the importance of this issue for our societies and our own ambition, for such is the mandate I was given, to establish an international and multi-institutional dialogue on this subject.
With regard to investment and competition, we are unhappy with one of the options put forward, which is to limit ourselves to working programmes.
In our opinion, working programmes cannot replace negotiations, even if it does make sense that there should be a connection between a working programme and a negotiation, provided, of course, that this is agreed in advance.
The issue of the relationship between health and intellectual property, which the President-in-Office of the Council mentioned, is also problematic.
As you know, we are very committed to this matter and we are working actively on reconciling the more extreme positions so that a substantial political statement can be agreed on in Doha, reconciling the flexibility of the agreement on intellectual property with, on the one hand, the need of developing countries for access to essential medicines and, on the other, the concern to ensure that innovation through research can take place.
These are our concerns and other delegations will obviously have their own concerns about the ministerial statement.
For a number of developing countries, the implementation of existing WTO agreements, or in many cases, their adaptation, is of the utmost importance and we must, we feel, be willing to respond openly and creatively to these concerns.
Some of the least advanced countries have a real problem of lack of capacity and resources and a solution must be found to this problem in the future work of the World Trade Organisation.
Despite the concerns that I have highlighted, most of the WTO member countries seem increasingly willing to show the necessary flexibility and openness to sufficiently conduct ambitious negotiations in Doha in terms of substance, and I am beginning to think that we might be able to see our four priorities met there: trade liberalisation, further regulation, the inclusion of development at the top of the multilateral agenda and the integration of our objectives for sustainable development into the WTO.
All of these aspects are designed to ensure that we give greater consideration to our fellow citizens' concerns.
On behalf of the Commission, I hope that the resolution you will be voting on tomorrow will provide clear and powerful support for these European Union objectives.
With a vote in favour, you will be strengthening our negotiating hand and sending a political signal to our trading partners and to the general public, that the European Union will not simply be taking a 'business as usual' approach to these negotiations.
To conclude, I should also like to take this opportunity to welcome, on behalf of the Commission, the Members of this Parliament who will be joining our delegation to Doha, and the positive and cooperative approach between us that I would say we developed in Seattle.
This is, in any event, the result of the questionnaire that I sent to you at the time, to which most members of the delegation replied, and I count on your active support to promote what is, in my view, our common agenda.
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner Lamy, it is my pleasure to be able to state on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that the major Parliamentary Groups have found it very easy to reach agreement on the joint statement which we will decide on tomorrow following this discussion.
This shows that on certain major questions a general view predominates over party lines.
We have not seen much of Commissioner Pascal Lamy over the past few months, and for once I can say that we are glad about this.
He had energetically and skilfully shuttled all over the world trying to create a basis for a new WTO negotiation round; on which a decision needs to be taken in Doha in mid-November.
In the midst of all this, however, Commissioner Lamy has found time to do a good and adequate job of briefing the Parliamentary delegation that is leaving for Doha.
We must thank him for this also; of course I was not to know that his message is so explosive that a fire drill would have to be arranged during it.
My group fully supports the negotiation line that the Council had already decided for the Seattle conference.
The new negotiation round to develop the liberalisation of world trade and rules of the game must treat matters on a broad basis so that we can strengthen sustainable economic growth; reinforce, develop and renew a trading system based on global rules; and ensure that its benefits are shared out equitably.
We are also happy with the idea that the meeting will be held in Qatar.
Now, if ever, it must be shown that we cannot be intimidated by terrorism; instead, we shall continue - on the 'business as usual' principle - with our policies of international cooperation for the sake of freer and fairer trade.
This must also work towards a better environment, social development, the reduction of poverty, and human rights.
There are some who would like to eliminate free trade, abolish the WTO and return to bilaterally regulated trade.
This road, ladies and gentlemen, would be a road to protectionism, and then on to trade wars and also, subsequently, to possible armed conflicts.
It would be a road which would make all enemies of freedom, democracy, the State under the rule of law, social development and human rights nod with satisfaction.
I would like to thank all my colleagues who have worked so hard in order to bring about a Parliamentary meeting in connection with the Doha meeting.
I would like to mention by name my colleagues Erika Mann and Konrad Schwaiger.
We have heard today that there is still uncertainty about the mission from the United States Congress.
We must indeed hope that at least as strong a delegation arrives from the United States Congress as from here; without them we will be a bit one-sided.
I believe that during the next few years we can develop Parliamentary monitoring of world trade; this is important in order to open up to citizens the work of an organisation such as the WTO and, through this, to seeking approval of the activity falling within its sphere.
Mr President, it appears that Doha has sounded the alarm bells here in this House.
Over the past two years, the WTO has been under fire on many occasions, with good reason.
Some of the critics claim that there is so much wrong with the WTO that we should not start a new trade round until the problems surrounding, for example, fair access to the world market for developing countries, the lack of democracy and decision-making within the WTO and the imbalance between trade and non-trade issues have been resolved.
We, the Social-Democrats, however, have reached the opposite conclusion.
These problems must be solved as an absolute priority, and it is precisely by starting a new trade round that this can be achieved most effectively.
Only then will reform be truly possible.
The PSE Group gives its unqualified support to a new trade round with a broad-based agenda aimed at economic and political reform. It is quite simple: we know that trade stimulates growth, attracts investment and creates employment, both within and outside Europe.
The world economy is now poised between recession and recovery.
The recession as a result of the terrorist attacks on 11 September gives the perpetrators ultimate triumph.
Who stands to suffer most from these attacks?
The world' s poorest of the poor.
The World Bank expects that the terrorist attacks will cut economic growth in the developing countries from 5 to 2.5%.
The expected growth and effects are approximately another ten million people under the poverty line and an added 20 000 to 40 000 children under five who will die.
That is a disaster.
A new trade round is necessary in order to restore confidence in the world economy to some extent and to open the way to renewed sustainable growth.
We also know, however, that trade on its own is not enough.
Without an adequate regulating mechanism, we run too great a risk of the trade benefits being distributed very unevenly indeed and of the environment and social standards coming off worst.
That is why in the negotiations with other groups on the resolution, we, as the PSE Group, insisted that the Fourth Ministerial Conference' s first priority should be to tackle worldwide poverty, reforms, democracy and the relationship between trade and non-trade issues.
Why?
Think of the impact of the WTO rules on matters such as the environment, safe food, workers' rights or the freedom of governments to regulate public services without running the risk of being taken to court by profit-seeking multinationals.
To the Social-Democrats, the fundamental objective of institutions such as the WTO is to bring worldwide processes such as globalisation under political control, enabling us to steer these processes in accordance with democratic, political choices.
It is therefore our greatest challenge, together with many developing countries, together with many reform-minded and sound NGOs, in the face of opposition from the neo-Liberals, but also from a number of our fellow MEPs here in Parliament and that section of the anti-globalists who oppose a new round, to start this new round nevertheless.
The Fourth Ministerial Conference is a key moment in the debate on globalisation, including the socio-economic security aspects of this debate.
If the programme for the forthcoming three-yearly trade round compiled at the Ministerial Conference does not provide a solid basis for progress in the field of democracy, the fight against poverty, environmental protection, growth in developing countries and the protection of public services, then we, as Social-Democrats, fear the worst for the course of the current debate on globalisation, and eventually the very concept of globalisation itself.
This is the message of the resolution which, we hope, will be adopted tomorrow.
We support a new trade round.
We are in favour of free trade which is fair and supports the citizens throughout the world.
Finally, a word about the acid test in all of this.
We hope that those cheap medicines which the President talked about in plain terms will also prove to be a true test, for without it we cannot imagine that this new round could be successful.
We wish Mr Pascal Lamy every success, for he is doing fantastically well so far.
He has a great relationship with our Parliament, for which we are very grateful to him.
Mr President, firstly I should like to extend our congratulations to both the Council and the Commission for what seems to be a much improved preparation for this meeting, compared to the methodological confusion that seemed to reign prior to Seattle.
We hope it will bear fruit in a couple of weeks' time.
As a group we are also very keen that we should learn the lessons from Seattle and not use the launch of the round, or the text for the launch of the round, to somehow foreshadow or preclude the conclusion of the round.
That is obviously a lesson well-learnt and we applaud the attempts to keep the document which will be discussed in Doha as crisp and brief as possible.
I am not entirely sure whether the principles of brevity and crispness have been fully respected in our own resolution, but this is certainly something we hope you will follow in Doha.
There are two issues of absolutely fundamental importance to us as a Liberal group.
Firstly, trade and the environment: for us issues such as the interaction between trade and multilateral environmental agreements, eco-labelling, the incorporation of the precautionary principle are not add-ons or luxuries, they are absolutely fundamental to the future credibility of the WTO and, arguably, of globalisation as a political process itself.
We feel strongly, therefore, that without those kinds of provisions in the next round of negotiations, it will simply become politically unsellable and unsustainable within Europe.
Secondly on agriculture, our own views are that paragraphs 23 to 25, whilst just above adequate, are a little convoluted and mealy-mouthed on agriculture.
We prefer the emphasis in paragraph 6 because it draws attention to the fundamental fact, highlighted recently by a study from the Centre for Economic Policy Research, that the greatest instrument to alleviate poverty is the further liberalisation of agriculture.
That is a fundamental principle for us which we hope will be fully respected in the next round.
Our group has not signed the compromise resolution with the larger groups for a number of reasons, but the most important one is this: We believe that fundamental reform of the World Trade Organisation's processes and rules must be a precondition for any new round of trade talks.
Reform is not something that can be simply addressed as one issue among many in a new multilateral trade round where it risks being traded off against other interests and demands.
In our view, the WTO faces such a crisis of legitimacy in public opinion that reform must come before any further negotiations, and that is the position we have put forward in our joint resolution with the GUE Group.
Now that is not a tactic for putting off indefinitely the start of a new round.
In our view, nothing has slowed down the WTO more than the debacle in Seattle which was caused in no small part by the chaotic and exclusive structures, rules and procedures of the WTO.
So, for those who believe in multilateral trade rules, as we do, serious reform is not an option but a necessity.
The lessons of the failed Seattle Ministerial were that the WTO must become a fully democratic and transparent organisation which genuinely supports sustainable development and which effectively responds to the needs of developing countries.
They need to be far bigger players in the WTO.
Their marginalisation needs to end and they need to be listened to.
In recent weeks, many poorer countries have made it clear that for them addressing concerns about the implementation of Uruguay Round commitments should be a precondition for a new round.
Just two days ago, a communication from the G77 reiterated that position.
Our group agrees with developing countries when they oppose new issues on the agenda on the grounds that expanding that agenda would over stretch the capacity of many developing countries which are already struggling to participate effectively in the WTO process.
It would distract attention from the unfinished development business and increase the risk that developing countries will end up accepting disadvantageous trade-offs.
The possible opt-outs that are on offer are not a realistic or effective way of dealing with these concerns, since developing countries still do not have the capacity now to affect the negotiations of an agreement which they may be later under pressure to sign.
Pressing ahead with a new trade round in the face of major opposition from the majority of developing countries is not helpful.
Simply calling it a development round without genuinely addressing the demands of developing countries is a sleight of hand that fails to address their real concerns.
Finally, our group agrees that strong international rules are needed to manage trade.
We agree very much that internationalism is important, but the current international trade rules favour narrow business interests and not the poor and the environment.
Changing those rules is the priority for Doha, not launching a new round.
Mr President, after 11 September, we have every reason to redouble our commitment to multilateralism.
Persisting with the Doha meeting and making it a success are, therefore, of considerable political importance.
Of course, we cannot at this stage hope for the sea change that is required, but adapting, improving and consolidating the WTO system would at least be a good start.
As supporters of the multilateral approach, we must fulfil this commitment.
The criminals who destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Center know the value of symbols.
Making trade the focus of coexistence with other countries is a deeply reductive approach and directing world trade centrally is unacceptable.
Multilateralism must be neither asymmetrical nor imperialist. Doha will not be Seattle, however.
Civil movements have helped to make their leaders think, the southern countries are, with the welcome support of the Commission, playing an increasingly important role and the time when Carla Hills wanted to use a crowbar to open up other countries' markets to her own will will soon be a thing of the past.
Doha is not a sign of a new wave of liberalisations, but nor is it an agenda for development.
It will be something vague between the two.
An agenda will be negotiated there whose objectives will remain general.
There has been no prior negotiation of the outcome, fortunately, and we approve of the principle of the Union' s mandate: to set a broad agenda, but more than just balancing liberalisation by means of rules, there is no getting away from the fact that we must try to resolve the contradictions between society' s choices and trade rules.
The social issue is symbolic.
The main front on which we need to fight is finance, and a Union which allows tax havens to flourish within its borders must put its own house in order.
Nobody can claim, though, that trade has nothing to do with fundamental rights.
The WTO may not be the place to produce social conventions, but it certainly does have a responsibility to ensure coherence.
The implementation of the Marrakech agreements and the incorporated agenda on agriculture and services will be at the centre of the forthcoming round.
The legitimacy of the trade interests of the South must be recognised but the problem will lie in preventing negotiations boiling down to a process of tough haggling over their interests and our own.
The concerns of northern societies as of those of the South must lead to a change in trade rules and to break their monopoly that favours one group.
With this in mind, we must accept that we will have to open the door to the renegotiation of certain rules, in particular, those concerning intellectual property.
Lastly, although the democratisation of the WTO will certainly not be on the agenda, it is nevertheless clear that this round will not succeed if it is nothing more than a diplomatic battle between countries, even if the European Union is happy to play the honest mediator.
Civil society must be involved; we must consult our citizens and take account of their criticism and their demands.
This is the only way to ensure that democracy will penetrate the WTO.
Mr President, Commissioner, on the eve of this new meeting of the World Trade Organisation, which I prefer to call the Trading the World Organisation, you have used the correct term: legitimacy.
The failure of Seattle, which I predicted, several weeks beforehand and in writing - forgive me if I gloat - was entirely due, in my opinion, to this twofold lack of legitimacy.
Firstly, because the WTO itself has no legitimacy and, whatever people may think, is not up to the task that it has set itself. I am talking more precisely, however, about the absence of legitimacy of the European Union and I must say that this is not meant as personal criticism or criticism of the quality of the very idea of having a single negotiator, even if it does have a mandate, to replace all of our old nations, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, which have, since the early middle ages, expanded on the mould of this international trade, which is now global.
No one can picture you, whatever your qualities, which everyone recognises, promoting both the interests of all of these countries and maintaining the diplomatic channels that the history of our ancient nations could allow us to fulfil, either with Latin America for Spain, Africa for France, etc. There is, as always, a huge pretentiousness or even vanity, on the part of the European Union, in seeking to replace, in one fell swoop, a thousand years of history and in claiming to be able to fulfil this role.
The second stumbling block, of course, is the hypocrisy of the World Trade Organisation, which is approaching these negotiations like a wolf approaches a lamb.
Since the financial world effectively took control of the economy twenty years ago, international trade is now mainly an excuse to continually, ceaselessly and forever and beyond expand the sphere of financial speculation to the point that these negotiations are beginning to look like a big raffle held for the benefit of those organising the raffle.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, international trade is in crisis: according to the forecasts of the Istituto affari internationali, 2001 will see growth of 2% compared to the 13% in 2000.
I feel it is right to raise the issues of WTO reforms, legitimacy and transparency of decisions so that we do not lose sight of the WTO' s primary, unique mission which is to extend international trade.
This is why Doha must not fail: it must not fail because it has to ensure the sustained expansion of international trade over the next few years.
The responsibility of the success or failure of Doha lies with Europe and the other more advanced countries.
In general, I feel that we must take note of certain considerations and questions. Firstly, in my opinion, we must stop following the line of reciprocity at all costs.
Removing the barriers to trade - even unilaterally - is not an act of surrender.
It is a farsighted measure, particularly in economic terms. I commend Commissioner Lamy for taking this approach with the Everything but Arms initiative, although we will have to explain to the European citizens that, under that initiative, which was well-received and rightly so, banana duties will fall definitively in 2009, that is in 10 years time - a geologically important period in many respects - and we will also have to tell them why.
A further problem we must avoid is overloading Doha with an oversized agenda. I would stress that Doha has a specific mission.
We must not overload Doha and the WTO by attempting to use them to put right a number of issues which we feel need to be rectified in the world today.
Certain positions expressed on the environment, health and employment standards do nothing to defend us against accusations that the advanced countries and Europe are actually using the extension of the agenda for protectionist ends.
The developing countries are in a strong position and are not so very far from the truth when they say that all these so very politically correct issues actually serve to slow down the opening up of our markets to goods which have to come, first and foremost, from the least developed countries.
With regard to agriculture, I feel that we must bring to an end this game of hide-and-seek, this game of role plays between Europe and the United States in which, while we are waiting for someone to make the first move and start to reduce agricultural protection, we are all maintaining duty levels and levels of agricultural subsidies which are incompatible with the liberalisation of trade in the agricultural sector, when, as has been pointed out, this is one of the sectors which could most be most beneficial to the developing countries.
In Europe, we grant a subsidy of a dollar a day per bovine animal - and these animals are not high quality, they are our own mad cows - when there are one billion, three hundred thousand human beings who have to live on less than one dollar a day.
There you have it: if we genuinely want the WTO and Doha to be successful, these are the issues we must address. We must be bold and, I would stress, abandon the principle of 'reciprocity at all costs' .
Unilateral measures opening up international trade benefit, first and foremost, those who have the courage to implement them.
Mr President, Commissioner Lamy deserves our gratitude for referring to the much-needed institutional reinforcement of the role of the European Parliament in European trade policy.
I wish to ask you Madam President-in-Office of the Council, whether you can support this position when you are assembling your papers for the forthcoming Inter-Governmental Conference and, firstly, for the Convention for which we are all striving?
It is there that the breakthrough should at last occur, so that the European Parliament can draw even in institutional terms with the American Senate and House of Representatives.
In the next few years, the WTO will, through the imminent accession of China and Taiwan - both of which have long been important trading partners of Europe - and the eventual accession of Russia, gain a global dimension, giving it an even greater worldwide representative role and presenting it with new challenges.
To achieve this, it will have to adapt its structures and change the way it works.
With Qatar, there is the additional factor that we must make a start and genuinely involve all the developing countries, not only the representatives of the least developed, in the negotiations.
The technical aid which the EU and the other industrialised countries are called upon to provide is crucial for these countries' future real involvement in the decision-making process.
The WTO must, however, also increase its efficiency despite these changes and become more transparent and more readily understood by the world's citizens.
How will the WTO harmonise its new, strengthened universality with the need to become even more efficient and make markets more open?
Our resolution attempts to reconcile these two requirements, although surely incompletely as yet.
We Europeans must contribute our environmental legislation, our regulations on food safety, our multifunctional agriculture and our social security legislation as expressions of a tangible European reality.
Now, some weeks after 11 September, it is particularly important, partly as a response to terrorism, that we, the EU and, particularly, the European Parliament, continue without distraction on our way towards greater openness and democracy in the WTO and resolutely set about the necessary reforms.
We need to promote fair and freer world trade rather than seal ourselves off by means of protectionism and fall back upon national markets.
We must also strive to realise soon the central proposition of the European Parliament - the establishment of an effective parliamentary assembly for the WTO, to be the world's mouthpiece in trading matters.
We therefore need representatives of the American Congress in Doha as well.
We are relying on the parliaments of the industrialised states, of the emergent countries and of all the developing countries.
May we ask, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, if you, at the end of your presidency of the Council, could give your support to this proposal, which we must implement as soon as possible?
We support Commissioner Lamy's efforts at using our cooperative structures to involve Africa in particular - Africa, that continent which is largely forgotten by world trade - more intensively in dialogue on the subject of a parliamentary assembly.
Our seminar on 12 April was the first example of a successful conference on trade, democracy and development to involve our friends from Africa alongside the representatives of the industrialised countries in America, Europe and Asia.
Technical support from the Commission and our parliamentary budget played an important part in this.
Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, Minister Neyts-Uyttebroeck, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic events of 11 September have led to a re-emergence of two concepts which seemed to have been forgotten: multilateralism and solidarity.
Firstly, political practice is developing in such a way that we can only confront global threats in a global fashion: all united.
Furthermore, we also know that poverty and underdevelopment are significant causes of insecurity.
A Japanese thinker, Daisako Ikeda, said that the new concept of security, which focuses on the security of States, must be defined differently, focusing on the well-being of peoples.
Only by extending freedom, human rights and development can we recover our security.
At the same time, these events have speeded up the decline in confidence in our security and the economy, areas which were already showing signs of weakness.
It is therefore now important that we send clear signs of revitalisation and attention to the concerns of our citizens and, above all, to the concerns of the countries which need it most, that is, the developing countries.
It must therefore be an absolute priority to launch this new round of multilateral negotiations in Qatar on the date set, not yet to negotiate, but at least to set the agenda in the direction we wish to take.
We want to move towards a result which provides a balance between opening up trade and subjecting that trade to rules, internal democratic, and external democratic, rules, which respect fundamental social standards, the environment and the security of our consumers.
We also want a balance between an increase in exchanges and special attention to the concerns of our citizens, as well as the concerns and needs of the developing countries, who must be allowed to share fully in the benefits of international trade.
In summary, therefore, the mandate which the Council has given to the Commission, in our opinion, corresponds to these balances and deserves our full support.
I would like to thank Commissioner Lamy for the sensitivity he has always shown towards the European Parliament and his constant cooperation.
In return, Parliament and the parliamentary delegation which will accompany him to Qatar will offer him all their support.
Mr President, in Doha the EU must show its hand.
On which side does the EU really stand in the global North-South conflict?
Things are looking quite bad.
In spite of the stream of protests from, for example, India and Malaysia, the least developed countries, the G77 group, China and a host of environmental and solidarity movements, the EU intends, together with the United States, to try to play its trump card by making the WTO' s free trade doctrine apply not only to traditional trade but to practically the whole of economic life.
According to what Commissioner Lamy said in a statement earlier today, the EU' s main objective is to open the markets of the developing countries to EU companies.
When it comes to TRIPS and GATS, too, it is obvious that the EU is on a collision course with the developing countries.
In this global struggle, which is more crucial than the fight against terrorism, a number of 'progressive' people have believed that the EU could constitute a tool actually to combat neo-liberal globalisation.
If the EU does not change its tactics, there is everything to indicate, however, that, when it comes to the crunch, the WTO meeting in Doha will be proof that all the fine declarations of solidarity are being abandoned.
It is then that a 'policy of naked interest' appears, that is to say, a policy that places the EU alongside the United States and against the majority of the world' s poorer countries.
Mr President, obviously the diverse manifestations of democratic resistance to the dangers of an uncontrolled expansion of the WTO's powers have given pause for thought.
It seems, however, that well-intentioned appeals are not going to prevent it from going down this path.
It is simply the case that trade in goods and money transactions are governed by the law of the market.
The market is, by its very nature, immoral.
Those who want to maintain their hold on the market have to make a profit or else they go under.
The WTO has obviously set itself the goal of cutting the market off from the demands of society at large and even from parliaments.
The opinions now on the table at least show an awareness of the problem.
It is right to take small steps.
However, far more ambitious steps must follow.
We cannot wash the coat of the bear which the WTO has become without getting the animal itself wet.
Our aim must be to work towards a new global economic order which distributes the wealth of this earth differently, justly and fairly, overcomes poverty, establishes and guarantees broad-based democratic cooperation giving parliaments a voice, and makes independent economic development possible for all countries.
The European Parliament should do everything within its power to challenge the Council and the Commission to do this.

Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would firstly like to thank you for the efforts you have made and the strategy you have employed in preparing for the Doha Summit, to promote fairer and more balanced sustainable development on a world scale, which contributes to respect for fundamental social rights and the protection of the environment, the benefits of which also reach the least-developed countries.
Kofi Annan recently said that the Doha Summit must be the development summit.
If this is to be the case, it is essential that the developing countries can be fully integrated into the structures of the WTO and they must be given easier access to world trade.
That is why I want to insist on the importance of the technical measures for developing countries, because it is these measures which will allow these countries to take full advantage of the commercial opportunities offered by the liberalisation of the markets.
Repealing or renegotiating the agreements already adopted is not the solution.
On the contrary, in Doha the European Union must remind all the member countries of the WTO that it is necessary to respect the commitments made in the existing agreements, just as the European Union has respected its commitments.
I am thinking specifically of the textile industry, which has strictly respected its commitment to open up its market, increasing quotas and progressively increasing the application of the GATT rules in the sector, which is something that not all countries have done, including the most developed countries.
It is true that trade, even if it is multilateral, will not in itself resolve the inequalities of our planet, but it may reduce them by reconciling the interests and concerns of all the parties involved, especially those of the weakest.
The European Union has proven experience in this task and we hope that after Doha, by following the line we have taken until now, Commissioner, we can finally succeed in it.
Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, like others, I wear a badge which symbolises trade with justice.
Open trade - yes, but only with rules.
Our national and European interests, yes of course, but also the interests of the developing world - your approach, Commissioner, and ours.
I am going to concentrate on two frankly difficult areas - TRIPS and the environmental aspects of trade which you have already mentioned.
Firstly, TRIPS: what we now have in the agreement is not clear enough or good enough.
Intellectual property rights are important in world trade, but we thought that the 25.5 million HIV positive people in sub-Saharan Africa could have access to cheap drugs under TRIPS.
Let us ensure that this is made more explicit after Doha.
Ironically, the United States, the world's most fierce defender of intellectual property rights is now faced with the dilemma of needing huge supplies of antibiotics to combat anthrax.
Attitudes may change with new circumstances - in any case, they have to.
Secondly, environmental standards.
The EU faces charges of protectionism.
Commissioner, you know that this is not the case, that we are ready to help developing countries in any way necessary as we are helping applicant countries, that we have science on our side and that we will not abandon our hard-won progress - why should we?
Multilateral environment agreements cannot be discarded in the name of free trade and the precautionary principle must be explicitly included in WTO rules.
This is a deal-breaker for us.
We in the EU know more than any other part of the world how untrammelled free trade can be controlled through multilateral rule-making to the benefit of our citizens.
Our achievements in the EU are relevant elsewhere, and we should defend them - your task Commissioner.
I know you will be tough on our behalf.
I hope you will be tough too on core labour standards.
Seattle did not work - Doha can if it is fair and if there is a balance of trade and justice.
Good luck Commissioner.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with your permission I will just say a few additional words, which perhaps have more to do with practicalities and less to do with the substance.
Firstly, I should like to compliment Commissioner Lamy most particularly on the superb cooperation which we are enjoying and - I think that I speak for everyone - on the excellent manner in which he is representing the European Union in the run-up to this forthcoming trade round.
His task will certainly be a difficult one.
The right balance needs to be struck between, on the one hand, representing European interests and, on the other, ensuring that the other countries, our negotiating partners, and in particular the developing countries, are brought on board.
Personally, I believe that this round will, more than any other, be able to send out a message to the world that it is possible to reconcile trade and politics.
I trust, Commissioner Lamy, that you are in a position to achieve this, working together with your colleague Bob Zoelleck, but also with the many other negotiating partners that you have.
It will not be an easy task.
However, everything bodes well.
I am grateful to you for consistently encouraging Parliament to play a more significant role in trade policy.
Regrettably the Council has not taken the same step.
Like you, I hope that we will be able to achieve more in this respect in the future.
Incidentally, I should also like to thank all those colleagues in this House who have always supported this policy.
I should, moreover, like to remind you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that you also have a task to carry out in Doha, namely organising the meeting with all of the trade ministers.
We have a good tradition of arranging for the European Parliament's delegation to meet the ministers attending the trade round.
I would earnestly request that you organise this meeting again this time and also ensure that we have a debate and that it is not just an occasion for a chat or seen as a bit of an afterthought, as the Council is wont to do, but that it really is an occasion for serious dialogue.
In addition, I should also like to inform you very briefly - my colleague, Konrad Schwaiger, mentioned this - that the parliaments will also have a joint meeting in Doha.
The invitation will be extended jointly by the President of this House and the President of the IPU.
I hope that we will make progress there.
Here, too, we need your support, Madam President-in-Office of the Council.
We have always had this support from the Commission.
Thank you once again for cooperating with us.

Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I should like to extend a warm thanks to all those who have taken the floor in this debate, for the good wishes they have conveyed to Commissioner Lamy and hopefully the Council presidency too, and I hope that we indeed manage to organise a balanced trade round with a broad-based agenda.
My only comment in this respect is that I very much appreciate the fact that you have valued our respective efforts to improve the atmosphere prior to the start of such a round, and that you, as it were, assisted us in those efforts.
This is a tremendous boost a fortnight prior to the start of this Fourth Ministerial Conference.
If you allow me, Mr President, I should like to respond briefly to the specific questions that have been raised, notably those by Mr Schwaiger and Mrs Mann about the role of parliaments and Members of Parliament.
Mr Schwaiger, I can only respond on behalf of my government with regard to our position concerning an amendment to Article 133 of the Treaty.
I can only say to him that it was not the Belgian government that has precluded an amendment to the article.
We will continue to strive towards a broadening of the Commission' s negotiation authority under that article, and towards greater parliamentary involvement.
Secondly, I can say to Mr Schwaiger and Mrs Mann that I am delighted with the initiative for a parliamentary meeting in Doha; that appears to me to be extremely important.
I will therefore be very happy to lend my support to this effort, and I hope that it will be possible to inject a little more stability into the meeting, because I believe it to be absolutely of fundamental importance for Members of Parliament - for in addition to MEPs, the meeting will, of course, also be attended by a number of national MPs - to learn to listen to each other.
Maybe it will then be a little easier for us, members of the government, to convince our national parliaments of the accuracy of some of our claims when they hear those expressed by their colleagues from other countries, and particularly from developing countries.
I welcome this development with open arms.
It is significant in itself.
It will also contribute towards more transparency in the activities of the World Trade Organisation.
This does bring me to one minor remark made by Mrs Lucas who believes that the World Trade Organisation should be reformed first, before negotiations can commence.
I should like to say to her that I cannot see how any changes could be made to the way the organisation works without a negotiation round.
I should like to draw her attention to the fact that the very careful preparation of the Doha conference in itself bears witness to an entirely different approach from before. Finally, I should like to remind her that the World Trade Organisation is, in fact, a very young organisation which is very much open to improvement, and we will happily take part in this exercise.
I gladly promise Mrs Mann, I will be organising a meeting with the Members of Parliament in Doha.
Mrs Mann, you know very well that you and Mr Westendorp, as well as a few other MEPs, have had the opportunity to exchange ideas with us immediately prior to the start of the informal External Trade Council, so we will naturally carry on with this tradition.
Mr President, I too wish to thank the speakers who have stated their support for the Commission' s position - including the President-in-Office of the Council - and also to thank those who have wished the negotiators good luck.
Custom dictates that I should answer those who expressed more critical views and who, in tomorrow' s vote will not be adopting the position that the majority groups have stated they will.
I shall do so briefly, replying first to Caroline Lucas - speaking on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - the reasoning in whose speech I consider to contain a slight contradiction.
On the one hand, Mrs Lucas, your group is in favour of tougher rules governing trade - specifically from the point of view of considering the environment - and yet, on the other, it is not in favour of negotiations taking place.
You must have some solution for changing international rules that does not involve negotiating.
Please tell me about it, because I have no such solution.
To Mr Herzog, whose group I understand intends to adopt a similar position, I would like to say that I particularly liked your expression 'tough haggling' .
There will indeed be some of that.
It is true that the WTO sometimes seems a little bit like a grocer' s shop but we must also remember that the more progress globalisation makes, the more trade develops and, occasionally, the more our values are at stake.
In these cases, I think that toughness becomes a duty, whatever resentment this may engender.
Mr Abitbol spoke on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group.
You lament the fact, Mr Abitbol, that the Union has a single negotiator.
I would remind you that this issue was decided for the future of the European Union 44 years ago.
You choose to see in this the vanity of our founding fathers.
Fifty years on, all I can see is their foresight.
Lastly, Mr Abitbol, on the point you made, as on other critical points that were made, I would simply remind you that although the Commission negotiates on behalf of the Union, it does so under the control of those who gave it its mandate, which are the Council of Ministers and Parliament.
Both will be attending the meeting: the Council, representing the States and Parliament' s delegation, with which you are familiar.
In all honesty, I really cannot envisage a more effective method of ensuring that the negotiator' s political responsibility is maintained throughout.
It is up to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to oversee this process of giving account but, ultimately, I shall return with a position that I have negotiated and it will be up to the Council and Parliament to state their position with regard to the Treaties.
This is how our democracy works.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m.
International trade
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0331/2001) by Mr Désir, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on democracy and opening up international trade (2001/2093(INI)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the transition from the GATT era to that of the WTO changed the dimension as well as the nature of the multilateral trading system.
With the advent of the WTO, trade rules were extended to a large number of new areas, including services, intellectual property, investment and rules on non-tariff barriers, that frequently affect non-trade issues.
These rules have a binding force, which is backed by a dispute settlement system with the capacity to impose sanctions.
Finally, enlargement, which begun under GATT, has resulted in an unprecedented diversity among its members with regard to international trade.
The rules of the multilateral trading system now apply not only to the countries that account for most of world trade or only to the one-fifth of world production that is traded across borders.
They also apply to goods and services that will never be traded internationally.
All countries are concerned and their internal rules affected, whatever their share of international trade.
In recent years, trade agreements have also had a growing impact on other international rules in areas such as the environment, health and social rights.
Thus, WTO agreements or decisions have threatened the precautionary principle, environmental protection and access to medicines.
The cause of this is partly the ambiguity of some agreements, such as the agreement on intellectual property, in the case of medicines, but with regard to public services, the scope of Article 1 of the General Agreement on Services is also to blame.
To this, we can add another reason for the undermining of the multilateral trade system: the democratic legitimacy of the WTO, an intergovernmental organisation, in principle, relies firstly on the equal participation of all members, on the fact that they have an equal say in the organisation.
Most of the developing countries, however, feel marginalised by its operation and cut off from the decision making process.
At least 24 developing countries that are members of the WTO have no permanent representation in Geneva, and numerous others have only very small delegations that do not allow them to follow all of the proceedings that concern them.
Many developing countries lack the necessary competences.
In such situations, form and content are real issues for developing countries because the rules and agreements more often reflect the interests of the trading powers that have negotiated them between themselves, sometimes in 'green rooms' or in informal meetings, which are far too secretive - than the interests of all members, particularly of the poorest countries.
Consequently, since the Uruguay Round, many developing countries have stated that they were not aware, when they signed, of all the legal, administrative and financial consequences of agreements such as the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property, which were drawn up without their involvement.
Generally, where the developing countries are concerned, six years on from the creation of the WTO, the picture before us reveals a limited opening up of markets in the north, considerable difficulties in implementing agreements and persistent marginalisation from the workings of the WTO.
This feeling is more acute still for the least developed countries (LDCs), which, twenty years ago, accounted for 0.6% of international trade. Today the figure stands at only 0.4%.
The WTO, therefore, continues to be dominated by the large trading powers, and it is they that benefit overwhelmingly from its policies.
And, two years after Seattle, the multilateral trade system is still undergoing a threefold crisis of democratic legitimacy, as a consequence of the uneven distribution of the benefits of world trade, of the marginalisation of many of its members, as a result of the impact of some WTO rules on other basic principles, even at international level, and lastly due to a lack of transparency and the limited involvement of parliaments and civil society in the work of the WTO.
Although the WTO has started to acknowledge the need for reform, this recognition has yet to be translated into the necessary changes.
As you know, Commissioner, our committee, therefore, adopted, by a large majority - 48 votes to 5, with 1 abstention - a report which is noteworthy above all for its set of practical proposals, grouped into four main chapters.
First of all, the equal and effective participation of all members is a key factor in any new direction for the multilateral trading system.
This will require an increase in the provision of technical assistance.
The Commission has already undertaken a number of actions and we urge it to persevere in this direction.
We propose going further, however.
The Commission should propose the creation, for example, on the basis of a contribution proportional to each member' s share of international trade, of a fund or an increase in the WTO' s budget, which would enable all member countries to have a representation in Geneva.
We propose supporting regional representations, which is already being done, specifically for the ACP countries, but we feel that we need to go further; we need to establish internal transparency; until all members have a representation, we must allow non-resident countries to have rapid access to records of meetings and draft agreements; we must establish clear rules on so-called 'informal' consultations to allow all countries that wish to take part to do so, by publishing agendas in advance and by ensuring that reports of prior decisions, which are sometimes prepared, are provided to the competent bodies in good time.
We also propose that the dispute settlement system be reformed, because there are still inequalities linked to the market share of the various member countries, to ensure that the small countries, those that account for a small proportion of international trade, can, in certain circumstances, seek financial compensation.
Secondly, there is the issue of opening the WTO up to society and external transparency.
We feel that much remains to be done in this area before we reach the level of other organisations, within which observer status has been given to non-governmental organisations.
We feel that the dispute settlement procedure itself could, given the judicial nature of the procedures, be held in public, as is the case in court proceedings.
Thirdly, there is the issue of parliamentary control, which was mentioned in the previous debate, at both national and European level and also by means of a consultative parliamentary assembly within the WTO.
Where the European Union is concerned, we propose that Article 133 of the EC Treaty be reformed, that the 133 committee be opened up to Parliament's representatives, and that the European Parliament' s assent be required for all trade agreements.
Fourthly, there is the balance between international standards and establishing new relationships between the WTO and other international organisations.
We propose that all other multilateral organisations, such as the International Labour Organisation, the World Health Organisation, etc., be given observer status within the WTO and that their opinion be systematically sought by the dispute settlement body when there is a risk of conflict between trade rules and other rules.
In our view, the European Union should propose a de facto hierarchy of standards at international level, with which all countries must comply. In other words, it should recognise that business law or trade law cannot supplant the principles of environmental protection, public health and respect for the social rights of workers.
It must fall to the ILO, and the ILO alone, to decide whether or not it is appropriate to adopt retaliatory measures and to impose trade sanctions on countries, and not the World Trade Organisation.
I feel, however, that the WTO must give a commitment to respect any decisions that the ILO may take on such matters.
To conclude briefly, Mr President, I would say that trade policy, which is one of the oldest of the EU' s policies and its oldest external common policy concerns, of course, economic interests, but it also says a great deal - or, in any event, the European Union says a great deal - by means of this trade policy, about its vision of the world and of north-south relations in particular. It also reveals a belief in a division between that which is the domain of the market and that which societies must do in the name of principles, such as, solidarity.
This policy must reflect the Union's fundamental values and objectives.
For this reason, the EU' s priorities must be the establishment of fair and equitable trade, a democratic multilateral system, and a reformed WTO.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, we need more and not, as has been called for several times, less, international cooperation.
For small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, we need the basic conditions to be legally certain and foreseeable.
The aim has to be to use world trade to create more wealth for our people.
In so doing, however, we must not overlook the fact that Europe has 18 million small enterprises, which, at the end of the day, employ two-thirds of the workforce.
This means that salaries are mainly being paid by small and medium-sized companies.
Sixty per cent of GDP and, important for us politicians, 80% of taxes come from small companies.
That is why where the WTO is concerned, we should not only consider involving and integrating the ILO in this process and reflect on how we might better structure it, but should also and especially bring the social dialogue and the social partners to the fore.
The Everything But Arms initiative should not contain the clause 'Everything But Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises' , but instead 'Everything For Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises' .
The economy is at the centre of this discussion, and this is something that we should not forget in the whole WTO debate.
Very briefly on TRIPS: here we should consider, in particular, having compulsory licences and, above all, development aid; we should consider having calls for tender and also giving countries medicines of the necessary quality.
As regards the dispute settlement mechanism, I should like to recall that many companies and individual firms are damaged by WTO rulings, for example because of carousel trade retaliation.
Here I should like to ask: how do these companies obtain redress?
How do they come to be damaged by an international agreement which is not actually in accordance with the law of the country concerned?
Finally, we need to introduce more transparency into these areas and ensure that decisions are made closer to the people.
That is why I welcome the fact that President Neyts will support the European Parliament and parliaments throughout the world in their efforts to bring more transparency and also in the end, I hope, more wealth into this world.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Harlem Désir, on his very good, clear and extensive report.
Commissioner, if the decision-making process in the WTO is not made more transparent and democratic then, in the long term, the people of the WTO Member States will not stand for it, because we cannot have nation states increasingly referring crucial issues to the competent supranational organisation, while parliaments and, therefore, also society at large remain prevented from exercising their democratic right to monitor and participate in its work.
Events in the Dispute Settlement Body must also be seen in this light.
The Dispute Settlement Body needs to be thoroughly overhauled.
It needs to be transparent and changes also need to be made to its composition.
In the same way, it is necessary for us, finally, to give the developing countries the tools which will actually allow them to participate in the negotiations on an equal footing and then to assess the decisions which need to be made as they see fit.
There is, of course, a difference between a delegation arriving with 150 experts and a developing country having great difficulty sending its ambassador to the places concerned.
I should like to point this out once more here.
Otherwise, Harlem Désir has already said everything that needed to be said.
Mr President, I would also like to join in the congratulations to Mr Désir, the rapporteur.
This report strikes us as an excellent piece of forward-thinking, a blueprint for the WTO of tomorrow.
It comprehensively rejects those who claim that the WTO is beyond redemption; that it cannot be reformed; that it is inherently biased against the poor or the dispossessed; and that it is just an agent for the rule of the jungle, rather than the rule of law.
It also rejects the contrary view: the idea that free trade should prevail at all costs; that the WTO should be an agent for the dismantling of outstanding trade barriers, and should do so to the exclusion of all other political and public policy considerations.
Instead, it represents almost a synthesis of those two views, because it shows how and when and why the WTO should, and must, be reformed.
It shows how the WTO must become more transparent and legitimate.
I should add that all the emphasis that we, as Europeans, place on the need for increased legitimacy and transparency in the WTO will come to nothing if we do not reform the way in which we conduct our own trade policy in the European Union.
I was delighted to hear the presidency today say that it has supported in the past, and will support in the future, Parliament's demands for more transparent and legitimate trade policy-making in the European Council and the European Union.
The report also - and this is perhaps its greatest contribution to the debate - shows the way in which the WTO has to be placed increasingly in a context of other public policy priorities and other multilateral organisations and agreements.
It cannot rely on a role as primus inter pares on the international scene.
Instead it should learn to interact with other priorities and other multilateral agreements.
Our role is, therefore, to flank the WTO with other supporting agreements in other fields, notably the environmental field.
Mr President, international trade is fundamental in our system and, in the opinion of those who advocate a different type of globalisation, including myself, international trade must be based on fair, equitable trading bringing development and wealth to the greatest number of people possible.
Regrettably, the trade negotiations held under the auspices of GATT and the WTO did not serve to create fair international rules: quite the opposite, they left entire communities with no defence against the greed of multinationals.
It therefore follows that these institutions are suffering an unprecedented crisis of legitimacy in respect of vast sections of communities, and are in vital need of thorough reform.
The Désir report addresses clearly the limitations and dysfunctional areas of international trade, of unequal participation, and the lack of transparency and democracy and the ensuing consequences, and proposes reforms to remedy these shortcomings.
We support the report and will vote for the motion, but we feel that this must only be the start of a process of change.
The Commission and the Council must refuse to be influenced by pressure from the rest of the world.
Mr President, justice must be done, but more importantly justice must be seen to be done: the WTO is a very powerful international organisation, dealing with rules and law, and it must be seen to act justly.
Accountability and transparency are therefore exceptionally important.
Global trade requires global rules and development requires understanding of some of the problems of the developing countries.
If we are discussing transparency and accountability within the WTO process, transparency for its own sake and accountability for its own sake are just not enough.
The fundamental purpose of both is to create integrity in the system so that those who have promised to do things, and here I mean the developed countries, are forced to do them because of international public opinion.
There are many things that the developed countries promised in the Uruguay round which have not been delivered.
Conversely, those in the developing world who now have systems of corruption and bad practice will also be brought to book through the process of accountability and transparency.
In this regard, I would like to support Mr Désir in saying that he has produced an excellent report which I want to support.
It is vital to understand the permanent position of the rule of law.
Equality before the law and confidence in it is an absolute necessity for developing countries.
Without it all the well-meaning words and the great aid-giving we indulge in will come to nothing.
Justice must be done and must be seen to be done.
Mr President, international trade is of central importance if conditions for growth and development are to be created throughout our world.
The rules governing this trade determine whether growth and development are to benefit the whole of humanity or are to be confined to the industrialised world.
Mr Désir' s report is an excellent instrument for bringing about something more akin to global justice in world trade.
The developing countries must be put on the same footing as the industrialised countries when it comes to participating in the joint work of the WTO.
For me, as a Social Democrat, global justice is an end in itself.
The acts of terrorism in the United States also point to the need to limit the basis for hatred and fanaticism.
Less injustice will increase the safety of us all.
The voluntary organisations must be given scope to express their opinions when world trade is discussed.
Democracy can be deepened through the setting up of a parliamentary assembly within the WTO.
Social dumping must be prevented and employees' rights must be provided for.
Fundamental human rights must be respected, the fight against environmental devastation intensified and child labour prohibited.
We must stop dumping our food surplus in the developing countries and, instead, give farmers in those countries a chance to increase their production and their opportunities to provide for themselves.
In that way, we can make our contribution to a more just and more secure world.
Mr President, the new WTO round perfectly illustrates our criticism of the way in which this body is organised.
This is supposedly a development round, but the European ministers for cooperation and development are not taking part in the forthcoming meeting.
Furthermore, the Committee on Development and Cooperation has not been able to deliver an opinion on the Désir report.
Fortunately, the report asks pertinent questions, and it has our support.
This is supposed to be a development round, but the 49 LDCs are opposed to it and rightly so.
Liberalisation, which is supposed to lead to development, growth and prosperity, has only made their situation worse.
The WTO perpetuates the imbalance in world trade and the establishment of rules that are unfavourable to the developing countries.
Furthermore, it has ended the preferential system instituted by the Lomé Convention.
Similarly, the Cotonou Agreement urges the ACP countries to abide by the GATS or the agreement on Trips but the UNDP, itself, states that the liberalisation of services will only benefit multinational companies.
The GATS is basically the IMA by the back door.
It is a tool for dismantling democracy.
Mr Lamy, if negotiations must take place, then they must focus on a root and branch reform of the WTO.
It is the development of the least advanced countries that must benefit rather than the development of multinational companies' profits.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank Harlem Désir for the quality of this report, which, of course, I fully support.
The point that you made just now, Commissioner, on developments within the WTO to my mind shows all the more the need for such a report.
I shall use two points to try to illustrate this.
The Commission must keep a close eye on the issues of agriculture and intellectual property, so that the current shifts we are seeing within the WTO do not continue indefinitely.
The dice have been and remain loaded against the weakest, either the poorest countries or the most endangered social categories in our own countries, because the WTO is a body that is neither transparent nor democratic.
Let us take the example of the Marrakech Agreements on agriculture.
They guarantee neither self-sufficiency with regard to food supply nor the right to protect biodiversity for the southern countries. They prevent the specific nature of small-scale farming in Europe from being taken into consideration, with all its quality, social and environmental aspects.
There is a danger that, in the near future, they may ban small farmers from sowing the seeds that they have themselves produced.
The Commission must exert pressure to change this, to have an in-depth review of the Trips agreement drawn up so that it is fully compatible with the Rio convention on biodiversity and the Cartagena protocol on biosecurity, as the African group within the WTO is calling for.
This will enable us to preserve the biological heritage of the developing countries and the traditional skills in the south as well as the north.
Furthermore, the patenting of living organisms must be prohibited, because these are the heritage of all humanity and cannot and must not be hijacked by private interests that want to turn life into a commodity.
I hope, Commissioner, that you will convey this message.
Mr President, Mr Désir' s own-initiative report makes a number of recommendations that are quite close to the spirit in which we are approaching the WTO ministerial conference in Doha.
You would like to see the developing countries integrated into world trade, which is an objective that we share.
You emphasise the importance of the WTO addressing the public' s concerns, over and above the traditional issues of access to the markets or of customs tariffs.
We also share this objective and feel, as you do, that rapid economic change and the effects of globalisation must be managed.
The fact is that progress has already been made on many of your suggestions, specifically with regard to follow-ups with technical assistance or councils for developing countries in WTO negotiations.
The European Union, for example, is responsible for establishing the ACP countries' Centre in Geneva, which will enable these countries to better coordinate their position and consequently exert greater influence within the WTO.
It is the European Union that insisted on streamlining meetings in Geneva and on making the participation of members who do not have a representation in the WTO easier.
I am giving these two examples, to which one could add the efforts made to encourage the accession of a number of countries - and in Doha, an LDC, the island of Vanuatu, will sit side by side with China and Taiwan, for example - not to suggest that the situation is perfect or that nothing remains to be done, but in order to ensure that the debate on the proposals for reform is held on the basis of a full and up-to-date knowledge of the current situation.
On this subject, I should like to make a small correction to a point of fact that appears in your explanatory statement, Mr Désir, concerning hormone-treated beef.
Contrary to what you state, the European Union has not been condemned for banning hormones in cattle breeding.
The WTO has explicitly recognised the right in this affair of each member to set its own level of protection.
The Union was condemned because, at the time, it did not supply the necessary scientific evidence to justify such a ban.
I have a few other different interpretations, or rather differences of opinion, concerning some of your comments or suggestions.
You mention the crisis of democratic legitimacy, which other speakers have taken up.
I disagree with the content of this criticism.
Admittedly, the system could be improved: it must be made more open and the developing countries must be more fully integrated.
The challenge of reconciling our 'civil society' agenda with our 'development' agenda is indeed formidable and your report, furthermore, attests to some of these difficulties, in that, for some subjects, you propose both external transparency and fundamental social standards.
We know very well that, where these two matters are concerned, our sensitivity to the positions of the developing countries forces us to severely limit our ambitions: consequently, our own position is not entirely free from contradiction, as your report highlights.
Nevertheless, calling the current situation a serious crisis of democratic legitimacy strikes me as somewhat excessive.
As far as I am aware, the Marrakech Agreement was not only adopted by the Member State governments, but was also ratified both by the national parliaments and by your House. In other words, the Marrakech Agreement has been ratified by the European Parliament.
With regard to your statement that decision making within the WTO is the sole preserve of the richer nations, I would say that, although this may once have been true, it is increasingly less the case in an organisation of more than 140 members and, in which, small discussion groups are inevitable in its day-to-day work.
We are trying to ensure that these meetings include both rich and poor countries and that they guarantee a representative mix both in terms of geography and in terms of stages of development.
It may be the case that these informal groups make it easier to reach consensus, but they never, as we all know, take decisions.
Many preparatory meetings of this type have taken place over these last few weeks, for example, the ministerial mini-meeting in Mexico at the end of August, the Europe-Asia meeting in Hanoi in mid-September, the Europe-Africa meeting in Nairobi in mid-October and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting at the weekend.
I would also add that, in terms of the method of preparation, the lesson of Seattle has been learned and that the participating delegations are larger and better informed about the issues you have raised.
With regard to dispute settlement, an issue you have also addressed, I would make three comments.
First of all, let us not forget that the main objective of the mechanism for settling disputes is the effective and disciplined implementation of commitments that have been freely negotiated and accepted.
This is what a member of the WTO hopes to obtain when it resorts to the dispute settlement procedure.
Like you, we are also opposed to immediate implementation and to trade sanctions.
There must be more room for trade compensation.
Personally speaking, I have greater reservations about your suggestion to replace sanctions with fines.
My fear is that financial penalties would not resolve the imbalance between rich and poor countries, and might, to some extent, even allow the rich countries to buy off their breaches of obligations.
With regard to the transparency of the panels, we are also in favour of opening up the hearings of the appeals body to the public.
Let us remember, however, just between ourselves, that the developing countries have very firmly held positions on this point, which we do not share.
Where the relationship with other rules of international law is concerned, we must ensure greater coherence and prevent conflict between trade and non-trade rules.
This must apply to the very substance of the commitments in question.
As to the issue of revising the agreement on intellectual property, which you consider to be necessary, I do not think that a thorough revision would be appropriate.
If we take the examples of access to medicines or of the patenting of living organisms, the agreement provides sufficient latitude to establish an intellectual property system that responds to the concerns expressed by developing countries.
It is the task of the members of the WTO to interpret and clarify this flexibility, and we feel that it is better to do so by means of discussion or negotiation than to leave this task to panels.
This is the basis of our position in Geneva, which I mentioned in the previous debate.
Mrs Auroi, the issue of compatibility between the agreement on intellectual property and the convention on biodiversity is one of the points that we wish to see clarified in these negotiations.
With regard to the incentive measures to ensure compliance with basic standards in the field of employment law, we agree with your wish, Mr Désir, to highlight the importance of strengthening the ILO and this is why your suggestion to create a multilateral agreement within the WTO does not fill us with any great enthusiasm.
As for the incentive measures to ensure compliance with basic social standards, I would say that we must not undermine the influence of the International Labour Organisation.
This is not a weak institution that the WTO must provide with a dynamism that it would not otherwise have.
We must instead work on improving the ILO' s profile.
Lastly, with regard to creating a parliamentary forum within the WTO, a proposal that, as I stated in the previous debate, we have always supported, I shall conclude briefly by saying that we shall make use of the guidelines that Parliament has laid down for this set of work, to which we can now add your report, Mr Désir.
I would say that, as this afternoon's debate has shown, the Commission' s political line, approved and implemented by the Council, is also coherent with the position of this House.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m.
Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0332/2001) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the progress achieved in the implementation of the common foreign and security policy (C5-0194/2001 - 2001/2007(INI)).
I would point out that, after the rapporteur, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, President-in-Office of the Council, and Commissioner Patten will speak, and they will then have to leave as a result of urgent air transport issues.
This change to the agenda is due to the evacuation of Parliament, which is of course neither the responsibility of the President-in-Office of the Council nor of the Commissioner.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, in recent weeks we have frequently said it, and in the light of this annual report we should emphasise it once more: since 11 September we have not actually learnt anything new.
It has become clear to us, however, and we have become more conscious of the fact that we need a new definition of security, that the old concepts of security policy actually no longer work and that, for this reason, a particular combination of external and internal security needs to be formed.
It is no longer the case, you see, that a potential enemy can be unambiguously recognised behind a border; now the enemy also has the ability to be in our midst.
Here, I believe, a coordinated approach needs to be agreed.
Admittedly, we also know that this threat can no longer be fought by individual states because the challenge is international and runs across borders.
That is why we also need to find cross-border solutions.
Each individual European state only has a chance of guaranteeing the long-term peace and security of its own people if we pool our resources, in terms of military forces, in the field of prevention and in the field of civil crisis management, but also in terms of ensuring cooperation between our security bodies and intelligence services.
For this reason, I believe, we have actually made considerable progress in the last two years in view of the decisions made since the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice and, in particular, those made at Cologne and subsequent summits.
On this basis, I think that we should press on with developing a European security and defence policy once the necessary conditions for doing so are in place.
In our opinion, we have to recognise that it will be necessary to make certain structural changes to achieve this.
This is because we believe that it will only work if, firstly, the Member States realise that only the joint institutions can act and that bilateral initiatives also weaken the individuals concerned, even if they think that it makes them appear particularly powerful in the media.
The second point is that the structures in the different institutions will also have to dovetail to avoid there being any duplication of work.
It does not, in my opinion, make any sense for there to be committees on civil crisis management in both the Commission and the Council, with the High Representative.
That is why I wish, on behalf of the European Parliament, to repeat our position that in the long term the duties of the Commissioner for External Relations and those of the High Representative should be merged within the Commission.
That should happen in order to ensure that there really is a uniform approach and so as to have uniform structures.
This has nothing to do with the merits of those specifically involved at the moment; it is a question of structure.
On this basis we must also, of course, make sure that this person has special relations with the Council so as to give their work the appropriate legitimacy at that level.
I also think, however, that we can make it clear that added value really is being generated.
I should like to give just a few examples here. I believe, for example, that the large anti-terrorism coalition would not have been formed in this way had it not been for the particular European influence exerted by the troika's travelling to the Middle East, which yielded significant results.
I do not believe that the large anti-terrorism coalition will be able to exist in the long term if the European Union does not foster stability in the Mediterranean area through the Barcelona process.
For this reason, I also believe that the European Union has the task of addressing the root causes which sow the emotional seeds of terrorism, whether it be in the Middle East, in the relations between Pakistan and India, or in other parts of the world where we should make a particular effort to make our contribution to securing peace.
In this process we have to recognise that our relations with the United States take the form of a partnership and that, regardless of all our efforts to develop our own security and defence policy, NATO is still necessary because it alone is able to guarantee the collective security.
If we wish to play a role in politics as a whole, however, we must also actively work to further develop our relations with Russia, build new bridges and provide those countries which at present cannot, should not or do not wish to be members of the European Union with a new framework and a new form of European economic area.
Nevertheless, I should also like to say that all of this will only work if we are also prepared to make the money available in our national budgets to make it possible to really keep our pledge to provide 60 000 people for the Rapid Reaction Force.
We will not be successful in terms of prevention and civil crisis management and we will not continue to play a key role in foreign policy, but will just be passive observers, including in our relations with Russia and the United States of America, if we do not plausibly demonstrate that we have our own military capability.
It is often the case that prevention only works if it is possible to show the country in which you want to intervene to establish peace that you also have military options.
It is often sufficient to possess a military capability - this is shown throughout history - to prevent military resources from even having to be deployed.
That is why realising our vision of having a 60 000-strong Rapid Reaction Force, transport capabilities and our own satellite system by 2003 is decisive for the credibility of the future European foreign and security policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Brok on his excellent rapport, in which he not only asks pertinent questions, but also, and from the outset, provides some valuable answers.
Incidentally, the report is most timely, because, with regard to all issues concerning foreign policy as a whole, in other words, the Union' s policy towards the rest of the world, security policy in all its aspects and defence policy, the European Parliament is clearly in a state of change.
I was present in this House for the discussion of the Treaty of Amsterdam, when we stated our disappointment at the little progress made on common security and defence policy.
Looking at the point we have reached today, we see that we have come a long way and especially that we have progressed very quickly.
The events of recent months and weeks have shown, whatever may have been said about them this morning, that the European Union is becoming, and is being perceived to be, an increasingly important player on the world stage.
This gives us both greater visibility and, of course, imposes greater responsibilities on us.
I am sure I am not the only person here to have been confronted over the last few weeks with the question: 'but where are the European Union' s troops?' asked by people who have completely forgotten that we are not involved and are far from being involved.
This means quite simply that we are increasingly perceived to be a player on the global stage and that we must have all the institutional, financial and other means available if we are to successfully achieve all of these responsibilities.
This result could clearly only have been achieved as a result of the energy and dynamism both of the High Representative for Security and Cooperation and of Commissioner Patten, who, in a spirit of perfect cooperation, both manage to represent us superbly on all world stages, in all crisis hot-spots on our own continent and in much more far-flung parts of the world.
We, the Member States of the European Union, are also increasingly managing - and the Belgian presidency has played a part in this - to speak with one voice in international bodies and I am thinking in particular of the United Nations, which currently play an extremely important role.
We therefore wish to see ourselves become a major political player on the international stage.
This will enable us to better shoulder our responsibilities so that we can contribute to peace and stability across the world.
This policy is progressing at the pace we had envisaged.
I am sure you know that this is an open process, in which the Fifteen want to involve the candidate countries and the allied non-Member States of the European Union.
Negotiations currently taking place with NATO are due to establish the methods of cooperation between ourselves and the Alliance, in order to ensure access to NATO' s resources and capacities and in order to avoid efforts being pointlessly duplicated.
As you know, these negotiations are not straightforward and you also know why they are so complex.
Ultimately, however, you also know - and I repeat what the presidency has already stated on previous occasions - that we have no intention of allowing this process of establishing the means to guarantee our being operational becoming hostage to events within NATO.
We shall lead the way and we shall continue to work to achieve the objectives I have mentioned.
I fully agree that conflict prevention and crisis management are amongst the foremost priorities of our action, and, as Mr Brok has said, these priorities must lead us to be committed at every stage.
We shall maintain this commitment on a long-term basis in various crisis situations, whether it be in the Balkans, the Middle East or in Africa.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis which has its origins in the terrible attacks on 11 September in the United States has shown that the European Union is capable of reacting in a rapid and coherent manner.
Our reaction bore witness to horizontal coordination and has, in fact, transcended the pillar division.
I believe that that too is, and will be, an important element in the further development of our common policy.
I should like to point out that the European Council has rarely been so outspoken over the past few weeks as it was in that context.
We have decided to adopt a voluntaristic policy vis-à-vis the Arab-Muslim world and we are united with many to give out the same message, namely that the crisis that has broken out and the fight against international terrorism can in no way be considered a war between civilisations.
This morning, we were reminded of the importance of resuming the peace process in the Middle East.
You know that the presidency will be making a visit to that region shortly in the hope of giving out that message and of receiving backing for this.
As I have already stated, our campaign in the Middle East is still based on the implementation of the roadmap, as can be found in the recommendation of the Mitchell committee.
(FR) With regard to the Western Balkans, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is committed to the systematic implementation of the conclusions of the Zagreb Summit.
Cooperation with the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia is one factor allowing progress to be made on negotiating stabilisation and association agreements with every country that participated in this summit, of which the transfer of Mr Milosevic to The Hague was the most striking symbol, although not the only one.
We welcome the progress made by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia since its return to democracy a little more than a year ago.
With regard to Kosovo, we are focussing our action on the preparations for the general elections of 17 November, and we are delighted to see that more than 170 000 Serbs have enrolled on the electoral registers, which provides hope that the result may be a balanced one.
The situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is unfortunately not so straightforward and, here also, it has taken all the efforts of our representative, Mr Solana, of Commissioner Patten, and many others, to prevent the crisis that took place there from unfolding into a true civil war.
As you know, the situation remains extremely delicate and Mrs Pack even drew my attention to the matter when I reported on the General Affairs Council decisions of 8 October.
We are all aware of this and we are monitoring the situation, as you and many others are, extremely closely.
I should nevertheless like to emphasise that events in Macedonia have shown that close cooperation between NATO and ourselves is possible and that we are able to play a role in the prevention and management of crises.
(NL) Another region in crisis where the European Union is pursuing an active control and prevention policy is Africa.
The troika will shortly be making a few visits to that region, too, in order to keep the two peace processes that are running there, and are sometimes faltering, I have to say, namely the Lusaka peace process for Congo and the Arusha peace process for Burundi, on track and to ensure that they can herald the end of the military action and hence peace.
For without peace, the reconstruction of Africa is not possible.
Could I finally draw your attention to the meeting of the European-African Ministerial Conference of 11 October? It was a great success from the point of view that a political dialogue was entered into, whereby, needless to say, due consideration was given to the development of democracy and human rights.
Lastly, with regard to our strategic partnerships, I should like to emphasise that our relations with Russia have also been given a new boost at all levels.
Little by little, we are seeing the establishment, not so much of mechanisms but of forms of contact and dialogue, which enable us to envisage genuine cooperation and a genuine strategic partnership.
This development can only contribute to the stability not only of our own continent, but also to stability throughout the world.
I must, however, state quite clearly on this subject, that this rapprochement between the European Union and Russia, in no way means that we will be any the less vigilant over the situation in Chechnya.
We are continuing to discuss the matter and to insist on the need to find a political solution.
Lastly, I should like to mention the Fourth EU-China Summit, which also enabled us to strengthen political dialogue but, once again, this political dialogue includes the issue of human rights.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have limited speaking time and the fire drill did not, of course, help and for this I apologise.
Out of all that has been said, however, I should like to take up, in conclusion, the three following aspects: a strong Europe, a Europe that is able to project its influence onto the international stage is, above all, a Europe in which internal cohesion supports external action; secondly, it is a Europe in which the synergies between Presidency, Member States, Commission and High Representatives are exploited to the full and, lastly, it is a Europe in which action, whether it be in the field of justice, defence, cooperation or anything else, matches the rhetoric.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Brok, ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
I am sorry for the reasons to which you alluded, President.
The fire drill has meant that this important debate is in a sense an inadvertent victim of the importance of enhancing our parliamentary security.
I will unfortunately have to leave shortly because the minister and I have to get to Bucharest by dawn - a challenging journey at this time of evening from Strasbourg!
We have to be there for the opening of the Stability Pact conference tomorrow, which, and it is not entirely irrelevant to what the honourable Member says in his report, at least indicates a measure of success over the last couple of years for the evolving common, foreign and security policy.
I would like to congratulate the honourable Member, on what is a very comprehensive and valuable report.
As he said in his own remarks, the evolution of a common foreign and security policy is shown to be even more timely by the appalling events of the autumn of 2001.
The honourable Member's report gives a very accurate overview of what has been achieved so far.
I particularly welcome his proposals for a strong parliamentary dimension in the common foreign and security policy.
It is very important that we put down deeper democratic roots for the common foreign and security policy and that should involve not only this distinguished Parliament but also national parliaments.
I have made a point of trying to appear in front of the select committees in national parliaments on bilateral visits to the Member States.
If anybody challenges the progress that we have made in developing a CFSP they should compare what happened during this crisis with what happened in the run-up to the Gulf War at the beginning of the 1990s or how we coped with the Balkans in the early to mid-1990s.
We cannot yet, as pop singers would perhaps suggest, 'strut our stuff'.
But we have some reason for being modestly proud of the achievements that have been made so far.
I fully agree with the report's analysis of the prerequisites of successful CFSP action.
We have to bring together the resources and instruments of all the EU players: the Community, the Council and the Member States.
I doubt whether history will regard the present institutional structures as ideal.
I do not put it any more strongly than that, but the High Representative and I have worked as hard as we could make these structures work as effectively as is possible.
What will happen in the future is for other people greater than me to determine.
I do not want to go through all my agreement with the honourable Member on individual regional and geographical areas, not least because Bucharest calls.
But I want to stress one or two points he made.
I could, for example, have gone into a detailed paragraph or two agreeing on Russia and the Ukraine, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, on the Balkans in general and on the importance of getting back to Mitchell in the Middle East.
The two points I should like to mention briefly are these: firstly, we rightly talk about the importance of trying to ensure that the international campaign against terrorism is not seen as a conflict between the West - Europe and North America - and the world of Islam.
It is absolutely right that we have to make it clear this is not a clash of civilisations.
But we have a real opportunity and responsibility in the European Union to use the mechanisms of the Barcelona process, to use the mechanisms of the Euro-Med partnership in order to strengthen the relationship between Europe and the Islamic world.
We have a real chance and a real responsibility to do this.
I hope we will seize it.
I also hope we will look very hard at our relationship with the Gulf Cooperation Council in this regard.
The other point that I want to pick up from Mr Brok's remarks and from the report is simply this: in my judgment, we have to try to ensure that we can make use of this crisis to open doors and windows which have otherwise been shut.
That affects, for example, our future relationship with Pakistan.
It also, in my judgment, very clearly touches on our relationship with Iran.
I have no doubt at all that the Iranians are serious in wanting to establish a better, more profound relationship between themselves and the European Union.
I have no doubt at all that they are serious about wanting to negotiate a trade and cooperation agreement with us.
They know perfectly well that any arrangements with us will involve a dialogue on human rights and related matters.
But I believe they are serious interlocutors and that it is incumbent upon us to respond as positively as possible to the overtures they have made.
On Afghanistan I will only say that I look forward - I hope sooner, rather than later - to the time when I will have to come back to Parliament and the Council and point out the financial consequences for all of us of the political promises and pledges we have made about the future of Afghanistan.
There will be an important moment when we have to put our money and our diplomatic efforts where our convictions have been and should remain.
Finally, I would like to say once again how important it is to mobilise all our institutions, all our competences, as effectively as possible in pursuit of a common foreign and security policy.
Sometimes it is possible to underestimate the contribution which the Commission can make and wants to make in the CFSP field.
There is a great deal that we can do in order to make sure that the CFSP develops effectively as a way of reflecting Europe's growing clout in the international political arena.
The rapporteur has been well ahead of his time in pressing us to do more in this field.
I hope that we will live up to his expectations in the months and years ahead.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Brok on his report on the progress achieved in the implementation of the common foreign and security policy, a report whose objective is not only to sing the praises of this policy, but also to point out its inadequacies and deficiencies.
It goes without saying that the European Community, making a virtue out of necessity, has, thanks to the determination of the Commission, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the High Representative, seen its visibility increased since the attacks on 11 September.
This morning, during the debate on the European Council in Ghent, the President-in-Office of the Council fairly diplomatically said that an awkward situation had arisen as a result of the tripartite meeting that had taken place outside the summit.
To a certain extent, Mr President, it is logical that in times of crisis each person tries to save their own skin, but, in my opinion, it is important not to give way to the temptation to act unilaterally, or, to be more precise, on this particular occasion, trilaterally.
Europe is strong when united, but when fragmented is weak.
For this reason it is important that Europe should be able to speak with one single voice.
And the European Union, in the aftermath of the situation that has arisen as a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks, has to rethink its common foreign and security policy, including within it the fight against terrorism, speeding up the achievement of its objectives and making the common strategies mechanism more efficient.
Today, unilateralism, including that of the most prosperous and powerful countries, as we have already witnessed, is nothing but a pipe dream.
In the globalised world we are living in today, politics, diplomacy, security and defence are interrelated concepts that have to respond to the new threats we are having to face.
Security becomes a universal idea that cannot be split up, far removed from the traditional concepts of state and status quo.
In turn, defence is constantly changing its boundaries in a world in which the perception of these is ever more blurred: nowadays, we cannot only consider the territorial defence of one State faced with a possible attack by another, but rather, as has been correctly said, we have armies that lack clear enemies and enemies that lack armies.
In this world of globalisation, not only economic, but where terror, politics, diplomacy, trade, aid to development, security and defence are all interrelated concepts, it will depend on us to be capable of understanding and accepting that dangers and conflicts affect us all in the same measure and the response to these will also have to be the same for all those concerned.
But we will have to start - and I am convinced of this - by creating a true common EU foreign and security policy with a common conscience that is efficient, coherent and visible, as Mr Brok' s report recommends.
Mr President, Mr Brok's report, which, as usual, is very carefully drafted, has come just at the right time, a time when we need some pointers for where the common foreign and security policy is heading.
For us, 'common' means above all, and I am saying this deliberately now, that we must not have, or even give the impression of having, a board of directors issuing instructions and determining policy.
'Common' also means, and here I would support my colleague, Mr Brok, that the High Representative's duties need to be combined with those of the relevant Commissioner.
'Common' also means ensuring that we have a European Union Rapid Reaction Force as soon as possible.
The policy has to be European to the extent that it clearly defines European objectives, and this means that we show solidarity with the United States of America but also insist that this solidarity is not a one-way street.
If I have to read at a time like this that the United States of America is still rejecting the International Criminal Court and that Congress is even debating whether or not those who cooperate with the Criminal Court should be penalised, then this is not what I understand by developing a policy based on solidarity between the European Union and the United States.
Solidarity with the United States must therefore also mean our drawing the United States' attention to those areas where it is necessary to pursue a common policy in the world community.
My third and final point is that if we form alliances, in particular this alliance against terrorism, an alliance which we must and should form, we will more often find ourselves facing a contradiction or conflict between our strategic concerns on the one hand and our human rights concerns on the other.
We should be under no illusion about this.
Anyone who wishes to enter into an alliance, and I do, with the Soviet Union, with Russia, with China and with the Islamic States, will repeatedly encounter this contradiction.
We should simply realise that we also need to make it absolutely clear to the public that this contradiction exists.
We need to work towards both objectives.
We should never abandon our aim of securing respect for human rights in the medium and long term when we have to form a strategic alliance, because if you support the shahs of today you will get the Ayatollah Khomeinis of tomorrow.
This can happen if we do not remain vigilant and at the same time put the issue of human rights at the centre of our foreign policy.
Mr President, our group recognises the efforts made by Mr Brok in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, which has been a positive effort to reconcile the various contributions.
However, we do not agree with the fundamental aspects of his report and, for this reason, we cannot support it with our vote.
As an example, I will now briefly mention three of these aspects.
Firstly, 11 September was an opportune moment for the European Union to demonstrate that it could play a positive, peaceful and reflective role with the United States, in order to find, in the International Criminal Tribunal and through International Law, a solution to the conflict.
What appeared to be taking place in this direction has now been frustrated by the emergence of the Schröder - Blair - Chirac triumvirate which has missed this opportunity.
Secondly, the report gives great importance to NATO, when we think that NATO works against the interests of the European Union.
Lastly, it is very important that the European Union should play a role in the Middle East and in the Western Sahara, and we are also wasting this opportunity.
Thank you very much.
Mr President, entirely in line with the current international situation, the rapporteur, my fellow MEP Mr Brok, is of the opinion that the fight against international terrorism should become one of the European foreign and security policy' s core tasks.
This task allocation allows me to draw the Council' s and Commission' s attention to the security situation in the Western Balkans and the Indonesian Archipelago.
Further to a recently published scientific analysis of the question whether Bosnia might function as European base for Osama bin Laden' s terrorist network, I should like to find out from the Council and Commission whether they have any concrete indications that Bin Laden followers are indeed active in the Western section of the Balkans and if so, how the EU and its Member States, obviously in close cooperation with the US, intend to stand up to this dangerous destabilisation of that region.
Furthermore, the Brok report calls for a continuation of the political dialogue with Indonesia.
I expect the Council and Commission to constantly monitor the security situation on the Moluccas where Bin Laden followers are also conducting a jihad against indigenous Christians.
Finally, I happily vote in favour of the amendment by Mr Gahler which states that the NATO and its extension on our continent are still vital as a guarantee for security across Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I know I am repeating what others have already said when I say that the tragic attacks of 11 September have changed the course of this century' s history for ever, but I feel that I can never stress enough how true this is, that the international Community is now faced with a crisis that is as great as it is unprecedented and unfamiliar, with rules and trends that not even the most experienced of political analysts is able to predict.
However, at a time such as this, it is important for the European Union to show itself to be as, and more, united than before and as, and more, capable than before of reacting with one voice.
At a time such as this, when all our worst fears are unexpectedly realised, we realise the importance of this Europe that we are integrating, the importance of being united and having coordinating structures able to operate in real time, of being able to think and act all together and in respect for all the positions.
It is certainly true that we still have a long way to go: the common foreign and security policy is not yet operative and there are still complex issues to be ironed out in its operating mechanism, particularly in the area of national sovereignties, but we now need, more than ever before, to speed up our work.
I therefore cannot fail to congratulate the rapporteur, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Brok, on his report and on the priorities he has set for the forthcoming year in this area, particularly with regard to what - as we have been witnessing in recent months - will be the real challenge of the new millennium: preventing conflicts, finding a non-military solution to the crisis and, most importantly, combating terrorism.
You see, the greater the possibility of seeing Europe united in terms of foreign policy, of making our foreign policy practical reality, the more successful Europe' s internal politics will be.
Quite frankly, the acceleration of the euro, acceleration on the economic side of things, has not been matched by acceleration on the political front. Well then, there must be acceleration in political matters, and the foreign policy is crucial if that is to happen, particularly at this time.
If we do this, we will achieve a stronger, more resilient Europe and a stronger euro, and we will certainly be able to take a better approach to enlargement and, moreover, to compete on equal terms with the dollar and NAFTA - Canada, the United States and Mexico - the Agreement as it stands, a market which already exists and already presents important political points of reference.
We must act and we must be fully confident in what we are doing: the foreign policy will become vital in the short-term future, especially for the new generations.
Mr President, Commissioner, if you would be good enough to take an interest in the debate, ladies and gentlemen, in our efforts to construct a common foreign and security policy we must not lose sight of the fact that, in the future, as in the present and the past, the European Union will certainly face the risk of its forces becoming involved in armed action.
Let us not be under any illusion: if this were to happen, it would never be in a 'clean' war.
No one is in a better position than a soldier to know that a war will always be 'dirty' and that, despite advances in technology, mankind will never be able to kill off all evil people just by pressing a button if only because it will find it impossible to tell the good from the bad with any degree of certainty.
War will always be dirty and will always be an evil, but it could be 'the lesser of two evils' , if it is only embarked upon in the aim of achieving a political objective that cannot be achieved through any other means.
To quote Clausewitz, 'War is only the continuation of politics by other means.'
It must, therefore, be ended as soon as its political objective is achieved and must not be embarked upon if there is no chance of achieving this objective.
What is the objective of the war we have just embarked upon in Afghanistan?
Everyone can see that it is to enable the Afghan people to rid themselves of a regime that has proved its barbarity.
This seems today to be not only desirable, but also possible.
We are sensitive to the suffering that this war is inflicting on the population and hope, therefore, that this objective is achieved as quickly as possible.
We must therefore understand that a halt to hostilities, even a temporary one, would only strengthen the position of the Taliban.
Let us show ourselves to be capable, having learned from the unfortunate experience of the Gulf war, of seeing it through to the end, in other words, to the establishment in Kabul of a regime that is acceptable to all Afghans. Let us show that we are capable of ensuring that country' s gradual return to peace and stability.
To this end, many of us hope that the European Union will give its support to the negotiations currently taking place under the auspices of the United Nations, between the former king, Zaher Shah and the opposition' s representative.
I would have liked to hear the personal opinion of Commissioner Patten on this matter.
I realise that he is not present to be able to give an answer, and so I ask you, Mr Lamy, whether you would be good enough to give us your personal reaction to this idea.
Thank you.
Mr President, I congratulate Mr Brok on his comprehensive report, and I agree with him that we have made enormous progress in terms of foreign and security policy.
Almost every time I open a newspaper, I see the names Patten and Solana in connection with some new trouble spot in the world.
He is right to say that we have responded to the current crisis with a coherence and unity that we would not have thought possible only four or five years ago.
He is right to say that the coalition against terror would not have been possible without the progress we have made within the EU to bring about that unity and coherence.
Clearly a lot still needs to be done, and we have to take advantage of the current crisis to perhaps change the emphasis in our work.
We spend something like 60% of what the Americans spend on defence, but we spend 400% of what the Americans spend on what might be called 'soft intervention' - humanitarian aid and assistance.
We need to try to change that emphasis.
The Americans need to learn from this crisis that security is not just a matter of power projection.
You can have all the weapons in the world, but you will be unable to defend yourself against a few people armed with box cutters.
We need to have a multinational approach to the global problems.
For our part we have to realise that we must have greater military capability in order to back up our actions.
That is why the capability process currently under way is so important.
We must put some teeth into our common foreign and security policy.
That is why I am disappointed with the news that Italy is likely to pull out of the project for A400M aircraft.
We need strategic lift.
It is often ironic that the countries that most engage in rhetoric about European cooperation are those that often fail to produce the action.
One final observation is that at the moment we are seeing a warming of relations with Iran and Syria.
I should like to remind colleagues that there are a number of Israeli soldiers and civilians held hostage by forces sympathetic to, or controlled by, Iran and Syria.
These people are missing in action and I would hope the Commission and the Council would use this opportunity to get those hostages restored to their families.
Mr President, Mr Haarder could not make it to this session, and so on behalf of the Liberal Group I would like to thank Mr Brok for a well-drafted report, and to congratulate him on this.
The report is a good one, but it still fails to take the full measure of the profound change which has taken place in international politics following 11 September.
We are still unable to grasp the full ramifications of this change; but we know that it is a very profound one.
The representatives from the United States have stated that a second Cold War has begun, and some have even talked of a third World War.
Here, in Europe, we have been wary of excessive dramatisation and have avoided using the word 'war' .
My personal view, however, is that, in time, history books will come to refer to this period as the Third World War.
We must very carefully analyse what has happened and what is currently happening, and very prudently come to grips with those problems which are now facing us.
We need a broad global perspective and grasp; we need something which, in English, can be called 'global governance'.
Finally, there is the matter which I intended to mention in my own intervention. The progress achieved in the common foreign and security policy during the last few years has been based on the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Rapid advances have been made, particularly in crisis management.
In the Treaty of Amsterdam we also took as our joint task the safeguarding of the Union's integrity and the maintenance of peace on its external frontiers.
Up to now, no definite content has been given to these new treaty obligations.
In the initial phase at any rate, the main question is probably this: how are the different geographical positions of the various Member States to be taken into account in sharing the burden and dividing the work among them?
From the point of view of the Union as a whole it may make sense for those Member States situated on its common external frontiers to direct their resources to the control and defence of these borders, and for them to take part in crisis management in a way which is in harmony with this primary task.
I hope that debate will be initiated within the Commission and the Council on the practical implications of the provisions of the Treaty concerning the integrity of the Union and the safeguarding of its frontiers.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I should like to join with other speakers in commending the excellent work of the rapporteur, my colleague Mr Brok.
Any analysis of the evolution of the CFSP would regrettably have to conclude that the Maastricht Treaty sacrificed political integration to ensure economic integration and, as a consequence, undermine the EU's potential to be a major foreign policy player on the world stage.
Nowhere was this more apparent than during the Bosnian crisis when there was significant disunity among Member States.
Our mediation efforts were dogged by bad luck.
It is also true to say we were ineffective peace-makers.
We finished up as the United States' junior partner instead of an equal one.
It seemed for a while that we had learned from this grim experience and there was a determined effort in the Treaty of Amsterdam to ensure more coherence in our common foreign and security policy approach.
Although the end-result of the Treaty negotiations represented a step forward, they did not go far enough.
However, I suppose we must be thankful that considerable progress was made at the Cologne, Faro and Helsinki Summits.
Whatever institutional and other changes take place, there will never be real progress unless and until all Member States act and speak as one.
The current situation in the wake of 11 September underlines this point.
The EU had an opportunity to be an equal partner with the United States in responding to this crisis.
Regrettably, the solo run by British Prime Minister Tony Blair has seriously undermined the EU's influence and our foreign policy strategy.
This problem was further compounded by the decision of the UK, Germany and France to hold a mini-summit prior to the Ghent Council.
If actions like this continue, either on the part of an individual Member State or a group of them, the EU's common foreign and security policy will be in tatters, despite the best efforts of Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana.
Mr President, allow me to start by echoing the congratulations by my fellow MEPs for the excellent report that Mr Brok has presented again this year.
However, I have to add that I am very interested to find out how the report would fare next year, for just when the common foreign and security policy is being further detailed, it is meeting with enormous new challenges.
The events of 11 September and subsequent events greatly impact on that policy. They will put it to the test.
It is too early to gain a complete overview of the new security framework and the new threat.
However, we would like to ask the Council and Commission to produce an initial evaluation as soon as possible.
This evaluation should also touch upon the question to what extent the pillar structure forms an obstruction to effective action in the new situation.
External policy has become internal policy, and vice versa.
The European Union is not sufficiently prepared for this at this time.
Conflict prevention and crisis management have taken on a different aspect.
Our approach is often still too regional and too geographic.
Horizontal issues must now be thrown into the spotlight.
Increasing use must be made of regional policy in an integrated manner to tackle terrorism and international organised crime which are interrelated in many ways.
The guiding principle in this should be to help each other.
Take countries such as Ukraine.
They form part of the problem which we are now facing because the lack of transparency in countries such as those, forms the ideal breeding ground for all kinds of crimes, to put it mildly.
We have too little control over this because we have not sufficiently developed this kind of cooperation.
Maybe we have focused our attention too much on the Balkans.
That region, too, is a source of security problems, but anyone who studies the 'map of evil' will realise that the new secondary routes of drugs, arms, illegal immigrants, etc. traverse the Slav Commonwealth.
I am pleased that rapporteur Brok insists on a more effective implementation of EU strategies.
There is more cause for this than ever before.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to echo the congratulations expressed by previous speakers and address just two points in Mr Brok's report.
My first point concerns conflict prevention.
The case of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia provides us with an example of unsuccessful conflict prevention.
If all of the Members of the Council had worked as intensively as Members of this Parliament have for years to put pressure on all Macedonian governments finally to put an end to the discrimination of the Albanian citizens of that country, then we would not be facing the difficulties and problems which we are now.
If this issue had played a part in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement then the Members of the Council would also have seen it as a precondition and the terrorists from Kosovo would not have had any support for their campaign in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The Macedonians would not now be under pressure of time to change their constitution almost because of the success of the terrorist campaign, because they would have already done so.
So much for our failure to prevent conflict in this country!
A second matter which is very important to me was addressed by Mr Brok.
I think that the Stability Pact should finally mark the end of the conferences and quick start packages.
The Stability Pact should be closely linked to the work of the Agency for Reconstruction and should perhaps be extended to the Agency for Reconstruction and Development in this region.
For this reason, the Stability Pact should be incorporated in the Commission's remit; this is where all of the work has to be done in any case.
We would then be able to avoid resources being wasted because of friction, we would be able to achieve synergies and we would be able to make progress on establishing real stability in the region.
In this way, we would, for example, be able to foster significant and large-scale cooperation in the energy sector.
We would be able to make progress on the free trade area in the region, on constructing transport infrastructure and on combating trafficking in human beings and other commodities.
Many Commission officials will in any case very soon be unemployed because the enlargement negotiations in the Commission are as good as closed in some areas.
Let us give these people something to work on.
Let us hand over responsibility for the Stability Pact to those who can manage it and take it away from those who have in any case already begun to abandon it.
Let us give the Stability Pact to the Commission and, perhaps, to one other wise man, Martti Ahtisaari, in addition, so that it really is a success for the entire region and for the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report under consideration states that the struggle against terrorism must become a central plank in the EU's foreign and security policy.
What should this policy be?
September 11 revealed with one bang the prevailing error of the old security policy.
A missile shield gives no defence against terrorism - I said this the night before at the meeting of our committee - nor can justice be created with weapons; at times, perhaps, it may be possible to put a stop to the perpetration of injustice. But we are so vulnerable that we are dependent on one another.
The benefit of each depends on that of all others.
I propose that a new fundamental policy line of dependency be created for the Union, both at the United Nations and at the WTO (concerning which we were speaking) and also within the Union.
Internal and external security policy must be connected; the difference between them, after all, has disappeared.
In this policy of dependency, we will use, in the first instance, social workers instead of soldiers; nurses instead of bombs; and teachers instead of missiles.
The more people and nations receive justice, the less terrorism will be generated; this is something which we all know.
I therefore ask the Commission to shape a clear fundamental policy line of dependency for all fields.
We must get away from armed security, this hangover from the cold war.
Who could sleep peacefully with bombs under the bed?
Mr President, there has only been one victim of this afternoon' s emergency drill and that is the answer to the question Mr Morillon asked the Commission, to which the Commission must, of course, reply!
I shall, therefore, try to play the role of nurse, by answering, at least in part, Mr Morillon' s question, which concerns the role of the King in a future Afghan government.
The Northern Alliance, as its name suggests, is composed of various ethnic groups from Northern Afghanistan.
It clearly does not represent the Pashtuns, who account for half of the Afghan population and it goes without saying, therefore, that a government formed or dominated by the Northern Alliance would not meet the criterion of being representative, any more than the Taliban government does, not to mention neighbouring Pakistan' s position on the Northern Alliance, with which we are all familiar.
We feel that the objective is, therefore, to bring together, in a government, sufficiently representative groups, with the support of Afghanistan' s neighbours.
The King' s role, if he is to have one, must, in my opinion, be considered with this objective in mind.
This, Mr Morillon, is basically all I can say on the subject.
I admit that it does not provide a completely adequate answer to your question and I shall ensure that you are given a more precise answer tomorrow.
Commissioner, I asked you whether you might consider my idea, which is that the Stability Pact should be linked to the Agency for reconstruction and development and, in particular, to the work of the Commission, which, very soon, will have enough staff to be able to undertake the work.
I am sorry; I thought this was a suggestion and not a question.
I am not going to comment on this point.
You are probably aware that there are various ideas about the way in which the Growth and Stability Pact should be managed.
This is part of a network of institutions set up a few years ago, probably in conditions where concern for total coherence did not prevail.
We can probably do better in the future.
I agree with you, Mrs Pack, that the European Agency for Reconstruction in Kosovo has done a good job and I think that everyone would recognise that.
The links between the Stability Pact, the Agency and the action undertaken by my colleague, Mr Patten will probably, at the right time, be open to suggestion.
It remains to be seen whether these suggestions will emanate from the Council or from the Commission.
On this point, I reserve the position of the Commission.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.45 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Turkey
The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:
(A5-0343/2001) by Alain Lamassoure, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the 2000 Regular Report from the Commission on Turkey' s progress towards accession (COM(2000) 713 - C5-0613/2000 - 2000/2014(COS));
(A5-0338/2001) by Alain Lamassoure, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on pre-accession financial assistance for Turkey (COM(2001)230 - C5-0219/2001 - 2001/0097(CNS)).
Mr President, since the last resolution adopted last November on the basis of the report by Philippe Morillon, which I welcome, Turkey has been through a year of great contrasts: it was a black year in terms of the economy, a tense year politically, and a year of progress, though unequal progress, in terms of the pre-accession process.
On the one hand, we should welcome the real advances.
Given the very serious financial crisis in Turkey since the beginning of the year, the government has had to play by ear.
At the instigation of Mr Dervis, a radical stabilisation and recovery plan was signed by the three coalition government partners.
It came into operation in the spring, under relatively satisfactory conditions, which have made it possible to undertake basic reforms, which had been put off for too long, and, more generally, to establish a healthier relationship between politics and the economy.
In the short term, however, one of its unavoidable effects has been a severe drop in GDP, of 8% this year, which may have serious social consequences.
The worsening of world economic conditions, both before and after 11 September, can, unfortunately, only make efforts to recover more difficult.
During 2001, Turkey has been genuinely committed to a process of bringing itself closer to European democratic standards.
We should welcome the fact that, at a particularly difficult economic time, a large part of government and parliamentary activity has been devoted to basic reforms linked to this European process.
In March, the government presented its national programme for the adoption of the acquis.
It is true that this first list of reforms is still vague as to the timetable for implementation and the exact scope of the proposed measures.
However, since September, the Grand National Assembly has begun to consider several dozen - around 34 - constitutional amendments, the first half of which were adopted at the beginning of October.
The results still lag behind current democratic standards: the death penalty has not been totally abolished, the non-Turkish languages are no longer banned, but are not fully recognised, the National Security Council remains, but civilians play a more significant part within it.
Above all, most regrettably, the principle of the supremacy of international law - and thus, possibly, in the near future, of European law - over national law has been expressly ruled out.
Undeniable progress has nonetheless been made, which the European Commission and the Council of Europe have welcomed as such.
Furthermore, on 8 October, the government tabled a second legislative package of rights and freedoms, which relate to the penal code and penal procedure and the laws on anti-terrorism, the press, political parties, associations and demonstrations.
The third advance outside parliament was that this summer saw the beginnings of a public debate on the taboo subject of the role of the military in political life.
Finally, I would also like to highlight President Sezer' s courage in denouncing corruption, an endemic disease of Turkish society, and in using his legislative veto against texts which represented a step backwards for democracy.
Because there are also delays and even retreats.
In the political sphere, the year was marked by dramatic events in Turkish prisons.
I will leave it to Mr Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who chaired the parliamentary committee which visited Turkish prisons, to express our views on this subject in a moment.
The draft reform of the audiovisual legislation was rightly criticised by the president of the republic, since it did not comply with the principle of the independence of the audiovisual sector in relation to the political powers.
The dissolution of the main opposition party (the Virtue Party) demonstrated that the political system has not stabilised and that changes in the law regarding the status of political parties are required as a matter of urgency.
In general, a gulf persists between good intentions and reality in the human rights field, where progress is too slow: the torture and degrading treatment of detainees continues to be widespread, freedom of expression is still unusually restricted and several thousand people currently in prison for offences would, under our laws, be considered prisoners of conscience.
The main groups working to defend human rights remain subject to what amounts to legal harassment.
In the South-East, the end of armed terrorism by the PKK has not yet been turned to account in embarking on an overall policy towards the south-east provinces and Kurdish identity, and, likewise, the unambiguous European Court of Human Rights judgment has not been used as an opportunity to set free Leyla Zana and the other former parliamentarians from the Democratic People' s Party (HADEP) who are still in prison.
Finally, since the consideration of the Poos report by Parliament, we have seen Mr Denktash' s surprising refusal to restart the negotiations proposed by Commissioner Verheugen, which I welcome, and the UN Secretary-General on the status of Cyprus.
And we note that Turkey continues to block the draft agreement between the European Union and NATO, a draft which is all the more urgent given current international tension.
In this area, as in others, the impression remains that the signs of openness which are, on occasion, expressed by governmental authorities, may be challenged by military powers, which still have an unusual influence on Turkish politics.
Since our resolution of 15 November 2000, which is cited in our current motion for a resolution, our Turkish partners have been aware of the importance our Parliament attaches to the official recognition of the Armenian genocide.
We hope that the processes of dialogue, such as those which bring together former diplomats and academics from Armenia and Turkey, will lead to a common understanding based on scientifically-recognised historical facts.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the coming year will be crucial in testing the real desire of Turkish political leaders and Turkish society as a whole to move closer to the European Union.
Over the coming weeks it will be possible to gauge the exact scope of the constitutional and legislative reforms regarding the rule of law.
Coming months will be vital in judging efforts to modernise the economy.
Finally, on the crucial issue of the status of Cyprus, after 27 years of political deadlock, the moment of truth extends from now until autumn 2002.
The end of negotiations on Cyprus' s accession to the EU are set for that date, and this will make it necessary, finally, for both parties to adopt a clear position.
Our judgment will be based on the facts.
Turkey wishes to have its own models for society and democracy.
This is a perfectly legitimate objective.
The European Union does not impose one single model.
On the contrary, its special achievement lies in bringing about the coexistence and collaboration of peoples who have had very different histories, for a long time mutually hostile, and who, on occasion, have very different ideas on fundamental subjects such as the organisation of society, changing moral values, relations between religion and politics, the status of minority communities or races and the application of the subsidiarity principle.
But there are two needs which we all acknowledge.
First of all, that there are universal values which make it necessary that fundamental human and democratic rights are guaranteed in the same way everywhere; secondly, that the models conceived in previous centuries must be adjusted to the needs of this one.
European integration is a way of helping one another to comply with these requirements and to preserve our special qualities in an exciting and dangerous world.
Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I should like to comment on the issues which relate to women's rights in Turkey, to which the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has paid too little attention.
Allow me, therefore, to point out that very little progress has been made with women's rights in Turkey, rights which we, the Committee, consider to be a sine qua non to the integration of Turkey into the European Union, because women's rights are human rights.
I understand that the Turkish National Assembly started a debate today on the reform of the Civil Code, numerous articles of which infringe the United Nations convention on abolishing all forms of discrimination against women, despite Turkey's having ratified the convention.
I trust parliament will pass this bill, as adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs in June.
However, the crucial question which arises is whether the law will also apply to existing families because, unfortunately, the Justice Committee submitted an amendment exempting existing families at the last minute.
It is quite unacceptable to introduce changes to the Civil Code that only apply to future generations and I know that women's organisations in Turkey have expressed their total opposition to this.
The national programme for integration into the European Union talks of revising the constitution so as to guarantee sexual equality; however, there are no plans, whatsoever, to adopt positive measures which, as the women's organisations have pointed out, would allow all the laws which institutionalise discrimination against women to be amended.
As far as women's right to work is concerned, I should like to highlight both the high rate of unemployment among women - 39.6% and even higher in agricultural areas - and the limited number of women who benefit from national insurance.
I should like to call on Turkey to abolish all forms of discrimination against women and I should, of course, like to call on Europe to provide the economic and technical assistance needed to put this into practice.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Lamassoure for his report, in which he also points out that, as a Member of NATO, Turkey is a very significant partner particularly at this time.
Despite all of the criticism which we have rightly voiced in the past and still do today, in respect of the constitution and human rights, we have to say that, compared with most of its neighbours, Turkey is a country which is exceptionally pro-western, democratic and respectful of human rights.
Everything is relative and must be seen in its context.
We also have to recognise that progress has been made in a number of areas and that, despite the severe economic problems which Turkey is currently experiencing, it is still attempting, by amending its constitution and changing the composition of its security committee, to ensure that the civilian political forces are given more powers to act in more areas.
We will have to check to see whether all of this is sufficient.
Commissioner, you will have to help us to respect the Copenhagen Criteria.
The Copenhagen Criteria explicitly state that we need to see developments on the political aspects for accession negotiations even to be justified.
We will have to assess this on a case-by-case basis.
If further negotiations get underway we will also have to answer the question of whether Turkey is in a position to meet the conditions of the European internal market.
At this stage, I should like to mention just two points, which will provide a tangible touchstone as the European Union embarks on this very complex development against the background of a very dangerous situation for security policy.
Personally, I cannot understand why Turkey refuses to seek a compromise under the European security and defence policy over the issue of the conditions under which it will be involved and what kind of cooperation there will be with NATO.
For me this is a test case.
We should not allow there to be any blackmail on this issue.
I believe that there has to be a willingness to accept a compromise which was negotiated in Budapest and blocked by the military.
Surely we should now be in a position to find our way back to these criteria and agree on them.
The second point concerns what should be done about Cyprus.
Is Turkey prepared to seek a constructive solution in Cyprus?
If a solution is not possible, how will it react when the European Union enlarges?
I believe that these are two very tangible issues on the basis of which Turkey's credibility can be judged.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Lamassoure on his report.
It is a very good report.
Some people think that it is too soft.
I do not believe that it is too soft; it simply uses a language which leaves the way open for a dialogue with Turkey and we want to enter into this dialogue.
There are a number of hard points, however, which we need to discuss with Turkey, and certainly there is still a need to discuss the issue of human rights, in particular.
It has been mentioned that people are in prison who should not be, first and foremost Leyla Zana.
Turkey could and should, particularly in the light of rulings made by the European courts, ensure that they are released without delay.
On the issue of Kurdish rights too, much remains to be done.
It is obvious that the language, which, thanks to constitutional amendments, can now be used, should also be employed in the official media as soon as possible.
The state of emergency could then be lifted relatively quickly in the provinces in which it is still in force.
The constitutional amendments which Turkey has made are positive steps.
We definitely wish to take note of them.
However, now it is a question, firstly, of removing the constraints still connected to them, for example the death penalty, and, of course, of ensuring that the constitutional amendments are also implemented.
A major task for Turkey is to do this in the very near future.
On the subject of time, I should like to come back to an idea which I put forward when I had the honour of drawing up a report for this Parliament comprising a road map or timetable, and that is why tomorrow we will also be proposing that Turkey, itself, should table a timetable next year showing how it intends to meet the political Copenhagen criterion.
Satisfaction of this political criterion is the precondition for our also being able to negotiate with Turkey.
After all, this is the aim of the whole exercise, of which this report is also a part.
I should also, however, like to address two points, which continue to be crucial for relations between the European Union and Turkey.
The first point is Turkey's assistance in shaping an active and efficient external security policy.
We know that at the end of the day this also presupposes that we are able to use NATO resources and this is still a stumbling block for Turkey.
Turkey needs to know that this is damaging its prospects.
The final problem is Cyprus.
Here, too, I should like to say quite clearly that it is important to resolve the Cyprus problem, firstly, for the Turkish population of Cyprus and secondly, and undoubtedly, for the Greek population of Cyprus, the whole of Europe and Turkey itself.
Turkey simply has not realised this.
I would stress something which I have said repeatedly in the past: Turkey's path to the European Union is via Cyprus.
Its assistance with resolving the Cyprus issue is not a precondition for our accepting Cyprus into the European Union, but it would be a basis on which we could enter into serious discussions about Turkey's membership of the European Union.
Mr President, the Liberal Group welcomes Mr Lamassoure's report, which we find balanced and thoroughly informed.
It will be closely studied in Turkey, where the reformers will find much to encourage them in their efforts to bring Turkey forward on the track of modernisation, liberalisation, full respect for fundamental rights and social and economic progress.
So far the majorities in the Grand National Assembly for reform are great, but could I urge our colleagues inside the Turkish parliament to respond to this report in a truly parliamentary fashion?
Why not pass a resolution calling for their government fully to respect the rulings of all the international courts, including the European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg?
Why not pass a resolution supporting the setting up of the Rapid Reaction Force and why not pass a resolution to bring pressure to bear upon Mr Denktash to work towards the integration of Turkish Cypriots into the European Union?
Such reciprocity between our two parliaments would demonstrate, in a dramatic way, that Turkey is truly advancing upon its European journey.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the interpreters for being here in greater numbers than us to translate this very important debate which is being held at such a late hour. Yes, Mr Pasqua, you will have the right to speak.
That will be very interesting. It is not late.
It is the morning for you. As you know, in any event our political leanings vary from morning till night.
So there is no problem.
I would like to say, not to repeat what we have said amongst ourselves since Mr Lamassoure began his report, that it is actually not only a well-packaged report, but also one which rightly says things clearly, being wise and measured.
It is also based on a high degree of consensus, since Mr Lamassoure has really tried to bring together all the opinions in this House.
One thing is clear: Turkey is trying to make reforms, Turkey is making efforts, but, nevertheless, things are moving very, very slowly.
And things are moving very slowly not out of wickedness but because of the fact that democratic culture, the culture of openness, is not a culture which, in a still very authoritarian society, has been imposed on the behaviour of all parties; on the behaviour of governors, on the behaviour of certain political forces or on the behaviour of the military.
Our role as the European Union is not, therefore, simply to give lessons, but, rather, to accompany Turkey on the journey towards democracy, in other words, to have positions to defend.
And that is why I will make a comment, and I would ask all those who still wish to tell Turkey that there was a genocide seventy-five years ago - which is true - in what way does that help the debate in Turkey today?
I do not think that that helps it.
So, what we have in today' s resolution, in this report, is the possibility of holding a genuine, heated dialogue with Turkish society, with the Turkish government, on our notion of democracy, on the notion of freedoms, on our notion of the enlargement of Europe, and, therefore, of the place that Cyprus can and must hold within Europe, and the place which Turkey can and should hold in this process.
I think we should be clear, however.
This evolution will perhaps be more discouraging at some times than at others. The European Parliament, the societies of the Member States of the European Union, will not show indefinite patience if the situation does not appear to be improving.
I would therefore like to end by appealing to the Turkish parliamentarians up there in the gallery, and say to them that if they really want the Turkey which they love and govern today to join the European Union, they must be aware that the efforts which our notion of democracy requires of Turkey are efforts which go beyond what is being undertaken at the moment by the Turkish Grand Assembly.
They are efforts which go beyond what seems acceptable to the Turkish military.
If they do not go further, our future will perhaps not be a common one, which would be a shame.
Mr President, I think it important that we send two clear messages today.
The first must be that we want Turkey as a member of the EU and as a member of the European family.
It will be good for Turkey, but it will also be good for ourselves.
The second message must be that Turkey is faced with a number of tasks, including that of being honest about its history and its genocide of one and a half million Armenians, half a million Assyrians, Chaldeans and Syrians and several hundred thousand Greeks.
In addition, there are the tasks - not only on paper but also in practice and in the real world - of improving the conditions in Turkish prisons, ceasing to keep prisoners in solitary confinement, guaranteeing the rights of minorities and ensuring democratic progress not only for minorities but, I would emphasise, for the whole of the Turkish people.
There are the tasks of completely abolishing the death penalty and of getting the political process under way that is necessary if political life in the Turkish state is to be democratised.
I have read my fellow MEP' s, Mr Lamassoure' s, report very carefully. I have to say that he is very diplomatic.
I think the report is excellent, but I also think it needs to be more precise on a number of points, and a number of amendments have, therefore, also been tabled, not only by my group but also by other groups, and I believe that most of them must be supported.
There is a single exception.
I do not think that the EU should interfere in the matter of where Turkey has embassies.
However, I also think that the report is sound, and I shall recommend voting in favour of it, but also, of course, in favour of the amendments tabled by, for example, my group.
Mr President, Commissioner, I have listened carefully to Mr Lamassoure and the Members who have just spoken.
I will surprise nobody by reminding you of the position of the French delegation of my group.
I have tried in vain to understand why the majority of this House have an absolute desire for Turkey to join the European Union.
For a start, most of the territory of Turkey is not in Europe.
You have decided to urge her to join us.
In reality, this decision has but one justification, which Mr Brok has just confirmed, and that is that Turkey belongs to NATO, and that it is therefore desirable for there to be a certain resemblance between the European Union, as some people imagine it, and NATO.
I have just listened to what Mr Lamassoure said, and what he said in his report, which was full of reservations, of observations which should lead us to ask questions, and while I believe that we should be careful about trying to promote or impose our institutional system or our value system, which is too often our tendency, there are naturally things which are not acceptable.
And it is true that while we are perfectly aware of the difficulties faced by Turkey as a result of the presence of Islamic fundamentalist elements on their territory, which are a danger, which require certain measures to be taken, at the same time we must accept that, in terms of democratic principles, the journey they have to make is still, to say the least, very long.
And besides, many of you have said so before me.
But I will add something else.
What I do not understand, even though a certain number of countries have, unanimously in some cases, such as France, condemned the genocide suffered by the Armenians, is why the current Turkish government and Turkish people, who are not responsible for the past, but who are responsible for a collective history, are determined not to accept responsibility for that genocide.
Other countries which have been responsible for genocides have been better able to accept their responsibilities.
I think it is justifiable, here and now, to ask them to do the same.
In any event, as long as it has not been recognised, as far as we are concerned, we will remain firmly opposed to Turkey' s entry into the European Union.
Mr President, earlier this month, a leading Dutch newspaper sported the following front-page headline: 'As terrorists we can go about our own business in Europe' .
Could this be an arresting and, therefore, not very truthful headline?
Not really, for the enlightening interview with an anonymous member of the extreme-left terrorist movement, Dev Sol, was in total agreement with this disconcerting title.
The outspoken Turkish terrorist left the reader in no doubt as to the fact that his organisation makes full use of the EU' s territory as their base of operation for their murderous actions against the Turkish state and as a willing reservoir of funds, as and when required.
'For in Europe, anything is possible' , the man simply declared.
And should Europe be serious about fighting terrorism, then action will also be taken here, he threatened.
Mr Lamassoure hardly touches upon this highly topical and acute problem in his report.
Despite this, it has been Turkey' s criticism of the EU Member States for years.
The rapporteur' s appreciation, expressed in Paragraph 29, of the Turkish contribution to the fight against international terrorism counts for very little in this.
About terrorism in Turkey, the Lamassoure report concludes in recital G "that Turkey has largely overcome the difficulties posed by various forms of terrorism in the past" .
I should like to find out from the Council and the Commission whether they share this, in my view, far too rash, conclusion.
Official Turkish sources produce very different noises.
These are voices which, following the satanic terrorist attacks on the US, have gained a great deal of support.
They express the feelings of authorities that are deeply hurt.
For years, they could not even count on European solidarity in their bloody fight against Turkish terrorist organisations. Quite the reverse, in fact.
EU Member States offered, and still offer, the activists of those movements shelter.
And while the Ankara authorities condemn the West' s specific policy of tolerance, this time round, Turkey is allowed to take part in the international coalition against terrorism.
After the memorable date of Tuesday, 11 September, Turkey considers that the time has come for the European Union and its Member States finally to issue effective anti-terrorist measures.
In specific terms, this translates into meeting Turkish requests to extradite Turkish terrorists instead of offering them asylum or a residence permit.
The European Union and its Member States should, at long last, recognise the permanent internal and external threat to the Republic of Turkey.
The double standards applied by the Europeans should, at least from the Turkish angle, come to a definite end.
The EU' s emphasis on human rights in Turkey coinciding with the fact that it turns a blind eye to the fight against international terrorism is unacceptable.
At least, this is the Turkish point of view.
Is this harsh criticism levelled by Turkey at Europe justified?
It is a fact that various violent groupings of Turkish origin maintain organisational structures in EU Member States.
Certainly after 11 September, it is more difficult for Brussels and the capitals of the EU countries to ignore this in silence.
How do the Council and the Commission intend to cooperate with Turkey, a country which has, after all, formally acquired candidate country status, in future in the fight against international terrorism?
Indeed, there is no shortage of legal and political pitfalls.
The far from gentle criticism levelled at the Lamassoure report speaks for itself.
Despite this, the progress of Turkey' s accession to the European Union will also depend on Europe' s reaction to Turkey' s 'open flank' , also known as the country' s Achilles' heel for terrorist attacks.
Mr President, I would not like to miss this opportunity to join the other Members, with knowledge of the subject, in complimenting Mr Alain Lamassoure on the quality of his report.
I say 'with knowledge of the subject' because I know how passionate the debates on this subject have been over the last two years or more.
I would like to expand on just two points of the report, which have already been mentioned by Mr Brok and others.
The first relates to the geostrategic importance of Turkey, which has certainly increased as a result of the events which have just taken place and by the European Union' s realisation of the need to enter into a coalition to combat Islamic fundamentalist terrorism.
To this end, I would like to say to our Turkish colleagues who are in the gallery, how in vain it would be, to fear that European defence might develop in competition, in parallel, and therefore redundantly, with defence based on the Atlantic Alliance.
European defence is based on the Atlantic Alliance and it will continue in that direction, quite simply because Europe would not have the means to do otherwise.
My second comment concerns Cyprus.
It has been said that the resolution of the Cypriot problem is one of the conditions, in my view a prior condition, of any possible decision on the entry of Turkey into the Union.
I do not believe that the Turkish populations in Cyprus are really in danger today and I believe it would be a very important gesture for Turkey to accept, as a first step, during the current negotiations, a reduction in the number of its armed forces in Cyprus, or even better, their evacuation.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should, of course, also like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Lamassoure, on his success in drafting a good report.
I am saying this, above all, because in Turkey, I often come across people making a certain assertion: those in Turkey who repeatedly accuse the European Parliament of being hostile to Turkey will now have to admit yet again that this assertion is not true.
Like the report of my colleague, Mr Swoboda, this report, too, is an objective opinion on the situation in Turkey.
As the rapporteur states, the flurry of legislative activity in the Turkish Parliament to reform the constitution really is laudable.
Given the current constraints in Turkey, our Turkish colleagues, some of whom are also here today amongst us, have really been very successful.
Now, however, they are asked to continue the work which they have begun.
The Ministries for Home Affairs and Justice in the Turkish Republic play an important role in this area.
The long-awaited implementation of the reform is urgently necessary, particularly now after 11 September, but also in spite of 11 September.
It is easy to ascertain through the Turkish media that people are still being tortured in some police stations.
There are still strange cases of people committing suicide while in police custody.
For as long as this kind of thing continues to happen in Turkey, and, for as long as Turkey is not prepared to meet the Copenhagen Criteria, there will obviously be no date for the start of accession negotiations and Turkey will remain the only country, out of 13 countries with candidate status, not to have started negotiating.
I hope that this last report will motivate those responsible in Turkey to move forward and, not only to talk about reforms, but also to really implement them.
Mr President, this very good report shows Turkey is making progress towards Europe, but more is needed.
For instance, 19 people are being prosecuted for insulting state officials because they attended a conference at which victims who had suffered torture in the form of rape in custody spoke out against their tormenters.
It is not only women to whom this happens.
It is clearly outrageous that the state should condemn the victims, rather than their aggressors.
I call on the Turkish authorities to drop these shameful prosecutions.
Secondly, I want to urge the Turkish government to take an initiative towards a political settlement with the Kurds.
The PKK have observed the cease-fire for over two years.
Its leader, Abdullah Ocalan, is appealing to the European Court of Human Rights against the unfairness of his trial.
It is time to launch peace negotiations.
Finally, now is not the time to eject 80 000 Kurds, breach environmental standards and human rights, in order to construct the Ilisu dam.
It must not be built and EU governments, such as the UK government, must not grant export credit.
Mr President, what efforts has the Turkish government made since the Helsinki Summit to guarantee human and fundamental rights, to find a peaceful solution to the Kurdish issue and to abolish the death penalty?
The latest amendment to the Turkish constitution does not go far enough.
The death penalty has only been partially abolished and the Kurdish language has not been recognised.
Is this a genuine reform?
I would answer, no.
Turkey must not be given any special treatment in the enlargement process.
I think that we run the risk of giving in to Turkey's wishes if we adopt the Lamassoure report as it stands.
The report is guarded on a number of issues so that we leave Turkey room for manoeuvre.
We must insist that a political solution be found to the Kurdish issue and that human and fundamental rights be guaranteed.
The time is right for sweeping reforms.
In my conversations with people on my trips to Turkey they have repeatedly expressed a wish for peace, brotherliness and freedom.
I, too, carry this message in my heart and will also do all I can in the future so that one day this wish will come true.
Mr President, I, too, should like to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur Mr Lamassoure on his recent effort to draft as objective and balanced a report as possible on Turkey's progress towards accession to the European Union, a task rendered all the more difficult by the particular nature of this country's problems in various sectors of special interest to Parliament, such as its record on human and minority rights, its democratic principles, its international conduct, its refusal to admit to tragic historic events and so on.
Having said which, I think that, thanks to certain amendments approved by the rapporteur and despite certain other amendments dictated by the policy of expediency, the final report which has taken shape is generally acceptable, even to the official Turkish side.
And, of course, we all know what that means, we just have to make allowances for the usual abusive response by the Turkish foreign secretary towards the honourable Mr Poos and his report, which is seen as negative towards Turkey.
So all that remains is to ascertain the extent to which Turkey will basically respond to the good will and to the spirit which dominates the report, by which I mean the spirit of constructive criticism of numerous Turkish shortcomings, the deliberately indirect reference to the continuing Turkish military occupation of Cyprus, which is unacceptable in a civilised society, the fact that previous Turkish crimes, such as the genocide of the Armenians, have been passed over in silence, contrasting with praise for any minor progress made by Turkey or any circumstantial compliance by Turkey with its contractual obligations, such as Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.
Time will tell if Turkey recognises and appreciates these well-meant messages, although I fear that experience to date does not give us cause to be optimistic that we shall soon have a clear response from Turkey to the effect that it really is prepared to prove itself worthy of its candidate status and of integration into the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Lamassoure report maintains that Turkey has a right to become a member of the European Union.
That is its basic message.
I, for my part, believe that membership is not just Turkey's right, it is vital to the country.
Historically speaking, Turkey has made an admirable effort to move towards Europe.
An effort which started not today but a long time ago.
Turkey's efforts to modernise started at the end of the nineteenth century.
We Greeks, as Turkey's neighbours and 'historic adversaries' , if I may put it thus, know this better than anyone else.
We know from our own experience how difficult it is move forward from a tradition of eastern despotism towards a modern society.
Turkey has a particularly long tradition in this respect because it was at the top of the pyramid of despotism in our region.
Turkey suffered the historical accident of basically coming out unscathed - not unscathed as such, because it suffered a great deal - but it was not defeated in either the First or the Second World War.
Sometimes it is better to lose than to win a war.
We must not forget that France and Germany, the mainstays of the European Union, were both defeated, one at the beginning and the other at the end of the Second World War and I think that they learned that armed force and confrontation are not the way to survive in today's world.
The disaster on the 11 September has taught us, I think, that today's world needs reconciliation in order to survive, by which I do not of course mean reconciliation with the terrorists, I mean reconciling tensions between us, precisely in order to isolate terrorists and establish a safe and fair world.
Turkey is a third world European country which needs to learn the same lesson as France and Germany, that is, that if we want to move on, we have to stop waging the wars of the 1920s or the wars of the 1940s in the present day.
I think that Turkey has built up an internal mechanism and a system of external relations which is dominated by the idea of authority and it uses this to tyrannise its people - witness the terrible story of prisoners' suicides and much else besides.
Of course, the move which Turkey has to make is a difficult one.
But it is trying to make it and we must help it and our reception of it in the European Union must be commensurate with its efforts to move towards us.
Mr President, the report acknowledges certain obvious truths.
That is a fact.
However, at the same time it makes findings which have no bearing on reality.
It sees progress where there is none, it extols the famous 'national programme' and a number of individual reforms which, basically, do no more than pull the wool over the eyes of the world in order to conceal the continuing and, from certain sides, the worsening situation for the working classes.
We warned that the decision taken in Helsinki would help not to democratise but to embolden the regime.
The army is still the determining factor in political life.
The grass-roots movement is being dealt with in the crudest fashion.
Arrests, over 10 000 political prisoners, torture chambers, murders, inhumane conditions in prisons, which are extolled in the report, are on the agenda.
The hunger strikers have been fighting to the death now for 370 days and dozens have already died.
The death penalty has only been abolished for criminal prisoners, not for people fighting for democracy and freedom.
The report calls these fighters extremists and the Turkish state calls them terrorists, while the Kurds are deprived of fundamental rights, the occupying forces remain in Cyprus after their barbaric invasion 27 years ago and the report says not a word.
However, the key point of the report is Paragraph 29, which extols Turkey's contribution to the fight against terrorism, clearly dismissing the Kurdish fighters, and its peace-brokering efforts in the Balkans, obviously meaning its open support for the KLA criminals, and it incites it to facilitate the application of the ÍÁÔÏ treaty.
Allow me to finish by saying that my brotherly love towards and solidarity with the Turkish people prevent me from voting in favour of this report.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, I think I was right to take my headphones off relatively early on.
It spared me somewhat.
Mr Lamassoure has submitted an excellent report, as numerous Members have said.
I should like to qualify the report as a fair report, because I think that Turkey, like every other candidate, is entitled to a fair report, meaning that we duly address all the shortcomings, but we also acknowledge any progress made.
I should like to call on our Turkish counterparts and the Turkish people to take note of the report as a whole and not just selectively, just as we are making an effort to take note of all the developments in Turkey.
Finally, I take the view that a Turkey that has made a start on fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria is preferable to a Turkey which has not made a start on fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria.
It is a Turkey that is motivating the forces trying to overcome the unacceptable shortcomings still remaining within the country in relation to the political criteria.
It is not in a position to expect political discounts.
We do, of course, realise that we rightly wish that all Muslim countries in the world were structured like Turkey and that we would then have fewer problems, especially in the light of 11 September.
But this discount does not mean turning a blind eye when it comes to the candidate countries.
On the other hand, however, Turkey is also entitled not to have any additional conditions imposed.
For example, I think that Mr Lamassoure has chosen exactly the right wording for the point on Armenia.
Having expressly referred to the genocide last year, we note this year that things are clearly moving in the right direction.
We realise that people are getting together to talk about the past.
My own country found this a very worthwhile exercise and I think that this is an approach which we should support in this specific case, so that good neighbourly relations can develop in the future between Turkey and Armenia.
Mr President, I, too, agree that not-insignificant progress has been made, and not just in terms of the Copenhagen criteria - a rather cold, aristocratic expression which conjures up an image of this Europe that always wants to be seen as a model of democracy.
I am thinking, rather, of the extremely tangible progress made in the field of honesty: the courage and honesty of a President who is able to condemn the corruption present in his own country.
However, we would be wronging Turkey if we did not make things absolutely clear to her - being clear, not hypocritical - and being clear means telling her that a great deal remains to be done in terms of democratic civilisation and behaviour, and that means reforms.
In this sense, the ability to implement political and social reforms benefiting the Kurdish minority is a highly effective parameter.
It is true and important that the Turkish Constitution intends to remove some of the restrictions placed on the use of the Kurdish language but, Mr President, I am appalled by this idea of partial removal of restrictions: the idea of partial removal of restrictions applied to a fundamental right such as the use of one' s own language is a quite horrific contradiction in terms. I am also appalled by the fact that only a cultural right is being recognised to a minority that does not enjoy even the most basic political and social rights.
Mr President, we expect Turkey to show signs of cooperation, and a sign in precisely this area - addressing this long-standing dispute with the Kurdish people with courage and tolerance, in a tolerant, civilised manner - would be very well received by the entire European Parliament.
Mr President, I would also like to pay tribute to Mr Lamassoure's excellent work as rapporteur.
Although I have been a constant critic of Turkey's human rights record and its treatment of the Kurds, I also strongly support the decision of the 1999 Helsinki European Council to recognise Turkey as an candidate country.
I do not agree with those who believe the boundaries of Europe should be narrow and exclusively Christian.
I want to see a pluralistic Europe.
I have always believed that Turkey could be a very important bridge-head between the current Members of the EU and the Islamic world.
This would facilitate greater understanding and mutual respect.
It is especially important in the changed world that exists after 11 September.
However, Turkey still has a long way to go.
In last year's annual assessment report the Commission concluded that, although a wide-ranging debate on political reforms had begun and Turkey had signed several international human rights instruments over the past year, the situation on the ground had hardly improved.
Let us hope that the publication of next month's annual report will show significant improvement.
In this context, I welcome the recent decision by the Turkish parliament to adopt a constitutional reform package to bring Turkey further in line with the acquis communautaire.
At the launch of the EU-Turkish Foundation of 17 October, Commissioner Verheugen said that these reforms are a significant step towards better protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Turkey.
It is clear that continued support for a closer EU-Turkey relationship, including eventual accession, is the best way to accelerate political reform and progress in human rights.
However, the timetable for possible accession lies in Turkish hands alone.
Negotiations can only begin when Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen criteria.
It must strive harder to fulfil its obligations in that regard.
Mr President, I think that this debate, once again, underlines the fact that we all share the same premise: that it is imperative that we, in the European Union, should have increasingly close relations with Turkey, until the opportunity arises, when the time is right, that it should become a Member State in its own right.
But it also underlines another point of view that we should make very clear to the Turkish authorities: that in order for this to take place, Turkey must become a full democracy.
I agree with what Mr Lamassoure has said in his report. The Turks have made advances.
It is also true, however, that this constitutional reform contains three elements that impair its credibility. First of all, it ceases to class as crimes actions that are still crimes because they fulfil the conditions as such.
Secondly, the constitution is being reformed, but other laws remain in force, such as the Penal Code, the anti-terrorism law and the audiovisual law, which continue to uphold the existence of certain crimes of expression, of opinion, of public demonstration and association. Thirdly, and most importantly, the constitutional reform is not being put into practice.
Arbitrary detentions and violations of human rights continue to take place.
We all receive, as I do myself, constant complaints, of which, today, there have been many, that are continually causing problems for the defenders of human rights and their organisations, not to mention, of course, the situation of the Kurdish people.
Yes, the Kurdish people.
It is not enough to lift the restriction of using a language if this is upheld in law and there is no recognition of the existence of a Community as a people in their own right.
This is the case with the Kurds.
This is even more the case, Mr President, where a Sakharov Prize winner, Mrs Leyla Zana, remains in gaol, and we must continue to strongly demand that she be freed.
Mr President, I would like to call on history to remind us that, while it serves its purpose on occasions to demonstrate a point, it can also let us down.
I would particularly like to remind Mr Pasqua that he should recall where the Presocrats originate from, that Ionic art was born in Turkey, and that the truly Christian French Kings did not hesitate to call upon the Ottoman Empire to fight against the Pope and other European States in the Sixteenth Century.
However, if we continue to look into history, we will also see both good things and bad things about Turkey.
Turkey, in the strategic position it occupies, is the only truly secular state, and Europe has been founded upon this great battle to achieve secular states.
On this level, then, yes, Turkey is a totally European State.
Its efforts to eliminate religious interference, whilst having truly fundamentalist communities within its borders, is something to be admired, and which could be a factor for future stability in the region.
On the other hand, under the Ottoman Empire, the Greek monasteries, the Sufis and the Sephardis all survived.
This was because, at their respective moments in history, the authorities did not attempt to destroy them.
Today, it is also a strong state fighting for the education of its people.
On this subject I would like to remind Mrs Uca, with a heavy heart, that 30% of women in Turkey do not go to school, nor are allowed to do so, so in this way they miss out on an education.
To conclude, I would like to say that there are also bad points.
The major black cloud over the Ottoman tradition is its perception of the unlimited rights of the conqueror over the conquered.
This gives rise to the great problem of prisons and exterminations: the loss of rights of the conquered, the weaker party, rape, exterminations, silence and death.
I think that it is in this area that we should offer our help, for Turkey is a stabilising factor in this region: it is establishing agreements with Syria and is an important element in the creation of a peaceful border with Europe.
We have to contribute to the strengthening of this strategy and its improvement, with European ideas used in governance.
Mr President, here is another chance for Turkey to exploit its strategic position and use its proverbial military capabilities: let us hope that, this time, its attachment to the West will be more effectively translated into vital internal reforms.
Mr Lamassoure has painted an objective, clear picture of the country but, despite some positive elements, he does not hide his concern that Turkey might regress to a state which is worse than the current situation.
It is positive that the Turkish government has presented a programme of conditions for joining Europe and it is positive that it is working on the Constitution, but it is negative that neither the 'road map' nor the timetable for the reforms has been clearly defined.
The European Union is not asking every country to follow the same procedure, but there are certain values, certain individual and democratic rights which must be respected - and Europe does know how to be patient - in Turkey and in its prisons too.
One final point: the question of the Armenian genocide is, strangely, becoming increasingly important with the passing of time.
Today, humanity no longer tolerates lies or inaccurate accounts when it comes to the horrific events of history.
It is not necessary to say, for example, how much the descriptions of the blood baths of the two world wars by former enemy historians helped to soothe feelings and cool emotions, and this example should be followed as soon as possible by Turks and Armenians, with a view to starting to normalise relations between the two neighbouring countries.
Lastly, I am sure that Armenia would be quite willing to erect a monument in front of one of the European institutions commemorating its sacrifice and entrusting it to history.
This would also make it possible for us, too, to produce documents on Turkey without worrying about how to address the question of Armenia.
It is necessary to remember the past in order to do better in the future.
Mr President, being one of the last to speak, I am in a strange situation in which basically everything has already been said, but not by everybody.
Nonetheless, I should like to comment on two points which I think are particularly important.
First, however, I should like to thank our rapporteur.
This is a superb report, couched in very moderate terms.
We can live with it quite nicely and, more to the point, it is a report which is conducive to consensus.
We must bear in mind that this is a progress report.
I think there will be a great many more progress reports to come on the question of Turkey's pre-accession to the European Union.
Now to the points on which I should like to comment.
First, the question of the death penalty which has not, I think, been adequately evaluated in the House this evening.
The general political reforms which Turkey recently introduced are very promising and we fully acknowledge them.
However, we all know, and Turkey should also know, which is why we must say so loud and clear, that they represent enormous progress within Turkey itself.
Naturally, from our point of view, they are just a beginning.
I must say, we always get a bit carried away when it comes to Turkey.
But, perhaps, the means are basically the end at the moment, especially when we consider human rights.
But, to come back to the death penalty. We obviously feel that it must be abolished completely.
There can be no partial abolition of the death penalty from a democratic point of view.
There can only be complete abolition.
That this is difficult in Turkey at the moment for domestic political reasons is patently obvious.
The second point which I think is important is the fight against corruption within Turkey.
Because as long as sleaze runs public and social life in Turkey, the people will have no faith in politicians and as long as they have no faith in politicians, they will put more faith in the military.
But it is out of the question in a democratic community for the military, in the form of the national security council, always to have the last word, de facto, on parliament's resolutions.
I think that a great deal of work is still needed on this within Turkey.
And that can only mean fighting corruption and ensuring that the people have faith in politicians.
Mr President, I want to thank Mr Lamassoure for his sterling work.
I wish to put the following question to the Commissioner with responsibility for enlargement, Mr Verheugen. Is it possible for Turkey to become a member of the European Union in view of the continued Turkish occupation of Northern Cyprus, continued Turkish migration from Anatolia to Northern Cyprus and the documented destruction in that part of the island of the historic heritage in the form of monasteries, churches and cultural buildings?
If, in the future, it is possible for a country, such as Turkey, to continue to occupy a part of another future EU country, namely Cyprus, and yet remain a Member State, what will have happened to that democracy and spirit of reconciliation that forms the very soul of European cooperation and the very values that underlie it?
In that case, what will have become of our credibility in working for peace?
I also think that it is necessary for Turkey, in the same ambitious way as Germany, to deal with the dark and sombre chapters of its twentieth century history.
It is not acceptable for Turkey to go on denying the Armenian genocide of one and a half million Christians.
It is not acceptable for it to deny that Christian Assyrians, Chaldeans and Syrians were also exposed to a genocide in which hundreds of thousands of people were murdered following a fatwa concerning holy war on the Christians, issued in 1914 by the top Muslim leader.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the broad agreement in this debate on Turkey's progress.
I hope that we can use this common ground when assessing the work in store for us.
I should also like to emphasise that the Commission agrees with the conclusions and views expressed by the rapporteur, Mr Lamassoure, in his report.
Here, too, there is a broad agreement and this, too, will be helpful as we continue in our work.
Several speakers have said, and I should like to stress this, that Turkey has become more, rather than less, important to us.
And this does not only have to do with its geo-strategic position.
I have always warned about reducing Turkey to a locality of special geo-strategic importance.
I prefer to believe that Turkey's uniqueness also lies in its cultural and historic heritage and in the political role which it can play at this global political interface.
The political elite in Turkey have demonstrated that they are absolutely determined to keep modernising the country and bringing it closer to European standards.
The constitutional reform which has now been decided is an important indication of this.
For me, this constitutional reform represents real progress.
Parliament adopted these important resolutions very quickly and with an overwhelming majority.
I think this large majority is particularly important, because it clearly shows that there is broad social consensus on the need for democratic and rule-of-law reforms.
These changes need to demonstrate that they are effective in practice, however.
The crucial question to Turkey is always, what has actually changed?
Which is why everyone is right who said, during the debate, that the point now, as far as they were concerned, was to see how Turkey implements these promising constitutional reforms and what actually changes.
In this respect, the Commission agrees with the European Parliament's appraisal that, the constitutional reforms and further legislative initiatives announced, notwithstanding, a great deal still needs to be done if human rights really are to be securely and permanently protected in Turkey.
Our relations have progressed well since Helsinki.
The pre-accession strategy has been implemented.
As with all the other candidate countries, the priorities for Turkey have also been set out in an accession partnership.
This year Turkey adopted a national programme for incorporating the acquis which also includes the timetable for new legislation which has been called for on numerous occasions here in the House.
This legislation will need to be in keeping with the acquis of the European Union.
We want to continue the pre-accession strategy for Turkey on the basis of the principles adopted in Helsinki.
This obviously means that there can be no talk of starting negotiations until the political criteria for accession have been met.
I would stress here that we are not in the business of offering discounts on the political criteria for accession to the European Union to anyone anywhere.
It is in keeping with the philosophy behind the Helsinki resolutions that, with the exception of negotiations, Turkey must be treated in exactly the same way in all other areas as the other candidate countries.
The Lamassoure report refers to the difficult economic situation in Turkey.
I should like to encourage Turkey to continue with the economic reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund.
As for us, we shall release the first tranche of EUR 75 million from the European Union structural adjustment facility for Turkey as quickly as possible.
As far as Cyprus is concerned, we continue to abide firmly by the view that the peace process should be resumed as quickly as possible under the auspices of the United Nations.
Turkey has promised to support this process.
But I must say quite unequivocally that the European Union expects this support to translate into specific action and result in our actually resolving this problem.
I am confident that accession negotiations with Cyprus will be concluded during the course of next year, which is why it is particularly important that the parties involved make every effort to find a lasting political solution.
The components for a solution, which take account of the interests and concerns of all involved, are well documented.
What we need is the political courage to grab this opportunity and resolve the Cyprus question now.
The window of opportunity is open.
But, it must be said, it will probably not be open for much longer.
A solution to the Cyprus question will benefit future relations between the European Union and Turkey enormously.
Relations between Greece and Turkey have already improved considerably.
The Commission welcomes the confidence-building measures agreed.
I congratulate the two foreign secretaries, Ismail Cem and Georgios Papandreos on their initiative and their success.
Both foreign secretaries did a great deal to foster a climate conducive to further progress in the region.
As far as outstanding problems with European security and defence policy are concerned, I called on Turkey, just a few days ago, to help achieve a constructive solution as quickly as possible.
In all events, this problem should be resolved before the meeting of the European Council in Laeken in December this year.
A little extra effort and it should be possible, and I am convinced that it is possible, to reach an agreement.
We are fully aware of Turkey's concerns, especially, as regards, possible action in its neck of the woods.
But I call on our Turkish partners to take a constructive attitude so that an agreement can be reached soon.
We should be able to expect a country which is a candidate for membership of the European Union to support rather than block one of the most important future projects of the European Union.
The Commission considers that it is important to improve relations between Turkey and Armenia in order to foster security and stability in the region.
The Commission therefore welcomes the very recent initiative by the civil society in the two countries to bring the two nations closer together and, with the help of independent historians, to reappraise the tragic events of the past.
I welcome the European Parliament's position on the programme of financial assistance.
The proposed amendments are acceptable to us.
I particularly agree with the European Parliament that care must be taken to ensure that various sources of funding and programmes are properly coordinated.
It is true that we are probably now in a decisive stage of relations between the European Union and Turkey.
Once the Lamassoure Reports have been adopted we shall have all the elements needed for our pre-accession strategy to hand by the end of the year.
We can then go on to the next stage in which we shall have to focus mainly on stepping up and putting Turkish preparations for accession into practice.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Loading and unloading of bulk carriers
The next item is the report (A5-0326/2001) by Rijk van Dam, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive establishing harmonised requirements and procedures for the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers (7193/1/2001 - C5-0292/2001 - 2000/0121(COD)).
Mr President, our group supports the work carried out, thus far, by Mr Van Dam and the Council, together.
We feel that this recommendation is a major step forwards, particularly in the field of maritime safety, especially since the statistics of past years are extremely alarming: in the last 10 years, between 1990 and 1999, we recorded the sinking of 146 bulk carriers and the deaths of 780 crew members, all of which occurred during the loading or unloading of these carriers.
The Commission' s directive harmonises, at last, a field of legislation which has allowed too many, too dangerous exceptions in the past.
We are going to harmonise the loading and unloading procedures, the safety standards inside and outside terminals and the levels of responsibility on board vessels and ashore.
I welcome the fact that all this has served to improve quality, first and foremost; we feel that quality must be an essential, basic condition if safety standards are to be satisfactory.
I welcome the fact that a balance was found quickly between Parliament and the Council' s positions, a balance which, moreover, respects the spirit of the amendments proposed and adopted by Parliament as well.
At last, as of today, we are on the way to more stringent legislation, to a code of procedure which has the merit of courageously placing safety above all other concerns, including economic and financial concerns.
That is why we are totally satisfied with the final version of this report.
Mr President, I wish to thank rapporteur van Dam for the successful preparation of the report.
Increasing marine safety requires ongoing work.
Increasing the safety of loading and unloading of bulk carriers is an important aspect of work for the improvement of safety in the shipping sector.
As is the case in many matters concerning marine safety, these rules are also agreed at the International Maritime Organisation on a voluntary basis.
Since the regulations are currently being applied only intermittently, it is good that they are being incorporated into Community legislation.
Improving the loading and unloading of bulk carriers and the efficient performance of ports will also further the development of important intermodal transportations.
Along with a further tightening of the rules, care must be taken that the decisions made are realistic and feasible.
The biggest shortcoming in the position of the Council is that, as the rapporteur states, information need not be given on all damage caused to the structure and fittings of a vessel.
In addition, I wish to call attention to the fact that decisions to increase marine safety, which are made only within the Union, are not sufficient.
Questions of safety and liability must, as far as possible, be dealt with on a worldwide basis.
The matter needs to be given a rapid passage, even though the common position of the Council has not included all the proposals of the Parliament's first reading.
Our group supports approval of the common position as it stands.
Mr President, the Commission is delighted by the report which has been drawn up by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, in relation to this proposed directive establishing harmonised requirements and procedures for the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers.
I wish, in particular, to thank Mr van Dam for his report and for the help he has given the Commission in its efforts to increase the safety of bulk carriers.
This directive will transpose into Community legislation the code of the International Maritime Organisation, which is currently in force in relation to the safe loading and unloading of ships, as well as certain parts of the convention for the safety of life at sea.
This code, which is, in fact, a recommendation, was established by the IMO in 1997, but, so far, it has not been widely applied.
As soon as its application becomes obligatory in all the Union' s ports, this code will be much more widely used and will, therefore, contribute to the safety of all bulk carriers visiting the Union.
As the rapporteur has indicated, this directive is aimed at combating the phenomenon of the disappearance of bulk carriers, that is, the sinking of these ships, which suddenly break up in open sea and sink in a few minutes, thereby causing the loss of considerable human life.
As Mr Fava has said, these statistics are unfortunately quite clear: over the last ten years, these wrecks have caused the loss of 134 ships with 743 victims, and there is a consistent tendency in terms of the average age and the total annual dead weight of the ships which have disappeared.
It was, therefore, necessary to deal with this issue of the safety of bulk carriers, and it is known that bad loading and unloading methods are considered to be one of the main causes of these tragic accidents.
As the rapporteur has said, the directive is designed to ensure that the handling of cargo in our ports respects strict rules, so as to prevent damage to ships during loading or unloading of heavy bulk cargo.
Before and during loading and unloading, the crew on board and the dock personnel must be in contact and in agreement, and, furthermore, a plan must be agreed in advance in relation to the way the loading and unloading will be carried out.
Heavy equipment which is often used in these operations must be handled with caution, and, in the event of a disagreement between the two parties, the dock personnel and the crew on board, the competent authority must be able to intervene to suspend the operations in order to prevent possible damage to the structure of the bulk carriers.
The Commission is therefore very pleased that Parliament intends to accept the common position of the Council without amendments, because, if it is adopted rapidly, this directive will be able to enter into force very soon.
This also shows that, on sensitive maritime issues, the European Parliament and the Council are able to rapidly reach a decision with the greatest degree of cohesion, and the Commission hopes that the cohesion demonstrated in this case will also be demonstrated in relation to the other great issues which are currently on the agenda.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Reporting formalities for ships
The next item is the report (A5-0327/2001) by Ari Vatanen, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on reporting formalities for ships arriving in and departing from Community ports (COM(2001) 46 - C5-0051/2001 - 2001/0026(COD)).
Mr President, Commissioner, and those ladies and gentlemen who are still awake, the economic integration of Europe is an objective which many, even among those who oppose political integration, can swallow without indigestion.
The promotion of local shipping also enjoys broad favour, since preservation of the environment and a significant reduction of congestion on our roads are essential.
The Commission's proposal for a common form for ports is a sensible step (even though on this occasion it does not arouse political passions) towards the simplification of port formalities.
It must be said that the forms in use at present vary greatly between Member States.
The proposed directive would mean that the International Maritime Organisation's FAL forms would always be approved in our ports.
For once we are getting a proposal from the Commission which does not increase bureaucracy in any way.
It would be nice if this could happen more often.
This stems from the fact that the Member States are by no means obliged to demand any forms; whereas, if a Member State regards it as necessary to obtain information covered by the proposed directive, it must always accept the FAL forms.
I support the Commission's proposal, and take the view that we should welcome it with open arms.
I have made a few technical adjustments which are in line with the Council of Ministers' preliminary position.
I believe that we can now, exceptionally, get by with a single reading.
I also thank the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, who succeeded in keeping the political animal which lurks in all of us under control, and did not churn out revisions of their own.
Putting our own stamp on everything must not lead to the objectives themselves being obscured and timetables being interfered with.
This time we neatly avoided this pitfall.
The general adoption of the IMO's FAL documents will promote the efficient functioning of the common market, and it definitely represents a welcome improvement.
I do not, however, wish to overestimate its importance, since what is involved here is merely a very small part of a larger whole.
We will not bring dynamism to ports merely by standardising forms; we need to introduce competition to ports as well.
The significance of my report does, in fact, largely hinge on the question of whether we will have the courage also to approve the Commission's proposal for deregulating port services.
I hope that Parliament will continue the project of building Europe by dismantling monopolies.
And, in this context, I look symbolically and appealingly in the direction of my highly esteemed colleague Mr Jarzembowski.
Finally, I wish to give thanks once again for the cooperation of the Commission and of the Council.
Europe needs constructive action and less politically-motivated confrontation.
I trust that we will be able to improve the status of shipping by the action now proposed.
Ladies and gentlemen, the rudder is set.
Let us steer Europe in the direction of competitive ports!
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports both this Commission proposal and the report by Mr Vatanen, who, having already demonstrated his adventures as a driver on roads throughout the world, now amazes us with his knowledge of a subject as difficult as maritime transport and the certificates that have to be completed when ships arrive at, or depart from, our ports.
Very gradually, people like ourselves, here, today, in this House, Mr Vatanen, myself, and all of you, are building a common Europe.
We are now eighteen, it is true, years behind with regard to 1 January 1983, which already seems like such a long time ago, when the Community institutions and the then ten Member States approved the Single European Act.
The standardisation of reporting formalities will, without a doubt, contribute to an improvement in maritime transport between ports situated in Member States, encouraging the promotion of short sea shipping.
By encouraging the transportation of goods by sea we will free up, to a certain extent, the amount of heavy traffic on our already saturated roads.
We can only regret that this proposal, as noted by Mr Vatanen in his explanatory statement, does not cover dangerous goods.
We ask the Commission not to limit this standardisation of reporting formalities to the Community.
The Community should press for this type of information to be common to the whole international community, promoting the International Maritime Organisation's Convention on the Facilitation of Maritime Traffic.
We would also invite those Member States who have not done so, to ratify this Convention, although the Commission proposal does not oblige them to do so.
I would like to finish by congratulating Mr Vatanen on his excellent work.
Mr President, I, too, would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Vatanen, for his excellent preparatory work, which aims to ensure the rapid passage of this important business.
An efficiently functioning internal market requires smooth working and more standardised practices than previously in the transportation sector.
However, the reporting obligations of ships arriving in ports and leaving them vary greatly from one Member State to another.
Most Member States have already signed the IMO's Convention on the facilitation of maritime traffic.
The proposal for a directive, now under discussion, is a good example of practices which are already internationally recognised as being good ones.
In my opinion, besides the safety of shipping, it is important to facilitate practical procedures.
By clear, uniform yet flexible procedures, shipping will be made a more attractive alternative mode of transport.
There may be a particularly positive impact on local shipping.
Improving the effectiveness of port practices will also facilitate the development of important intermodal transportation systems.
Since several forms are in use, attention needs to be given, in the future, to how electronic communications can be better utilised.
A positive aspect of this proposal is that the directive is intended to pass into law within a rapid timetable.
The rapporteur has made good revisions to the proposal for a directive.
Our group supports the approval of the report and its rapid passage through the legislative process.
Mr President, once again, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Vatanen on this very good report, and to thank the other speakers in the debate, and also welcome the fact that all the institutions have studied this proposal within a very short timescale, and that it will be possible to reach an agreement in due course on this subject as we did on the previous one.
This demonstrates the importance which we all now attach to short sea shipping.
For several years, the Community has been implementing a complete strategy aimed at making short sea shipping a viable and realistic alternative to purely road transport.
This strategy has, furthermore, been reinforced in the White Paper on European transport policy until 2010.
One of the elements of this strategy is to remove the obstacles preventing the development of short sea shipping.
Our recent exercise in recording these obstacles showed that the complexity of the administrative documentary procedures was considered to be one of the main bottlenecks.
Mr Vatanen was kind enough to say that the Commission was dealing with the paperwork, for once.
I give credit for this U-turn to him.
The Commission has therefore presented a proposal aimed at simplifying certain documentary procedures.
We have chosen to deal with the routine procedures which ships have to go through each time they enter or leave a port.
The procedures currently in force are not in themselves unreasonable, but the methods for conforming to them are so different from one Member State to another that they often lead to confusion amongst shipowners and operators.
Moreover, the International Maritime Organisation has produced a number of standardised forms in order to harmonise these procedures, and we therefore believed that standardisation was necessary, so that ships may know what information they need to present to the authorities and the way in which they must do so, whichever port they are visiting.
Given that there are already internationally recognised standardised forms, we have opted for the simple solution of using them.
This will probably lead to the worldwide application of the IMO forms.
This proposal, therefore, simplifies the necessary complex documentary procedures in the field of maritime transport.
It does not impose new obligations on shipowners. Instead it allows them to carry out certain obligatory declarations in a harmonised and simplified fashion.
Since these declarations will be identical regardless of the flag or sector of activity, there is no reason to exclude any of them from the scope of our proposal, which therefore applies to both short sea shipping and ocean navigation, and which will not distinguish between flags.
Thank you, once again, to Mr Vatanen.
Thanks to the amendments which he has presented in his report, we believe we will be able to reach an agreement with the Council with a view to adopting this proposal at first reading.
This is good news and we are grateful for it.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Accession to the WTO
The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:
(A5-0366/2001) by Per Gahrton, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing the Community position within the Ministerial Conference set up by the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation on the accession of the People's Republic of China to the World Trade Organisation (COM (2001) 517 - C5-0487/2001 - 2001/0218(CNS));
(A5-0367/2001) by Per Gahrton, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing the Community position within the Ministerial Conference set up by the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation on the accession of the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (Chinese Taipei) to the World Trade Organisation (COM(2001) 518 - C5-0488/2001 - 2001/0216(CNS)).

Mr President, the accession of the People' s Republic of China to the WTO is, without doubt, one of the major ventures and experiments of our time.
The People' s Republic of China, which is still a country formally governed by a Communist party, is now to be a part of what might be called the stronghold of the free market economy, the WTO.
If the Commission is to be believed, that is a huge victory from the EU' s point of view.
It is said that this is a one-way market opening process.
It is thought that, for the EU, China' s accession to the WTO will signal an enormous gain in enforceable rights, with no significant change in the EU' s own commitments towards China.
It is really quite a one-way process that is described in the Commission' s proposal.
China must adapt.
The EU does not need to do very much.
Certain China-specific quantitative restrictions are to be phased out.
However, these are of relatively little importance.
If the Commission' s description in Paragraph 13 is to be believed, accession to the WTO will be good for China' s economy.
I have a number of doubts on that score.
Clearly, the Commission has to look after the EU' s interests, but the issue is whether, in the era of globalisation, we might not have passed the point at which trade policy could be judged as if it were a football match, in which winning is everything and there is complete indifference to how things are for the other side.
I therefore think it is quite remarkable that, in its proposal, the Commission does not say so much as a word to hint that accession might nonetheless lead to problems for the other party, namely the People' s Republic of China.
I must briefly relate a number of facts to indicate that there may be certain problems for this large, but, nonetheless, still underdeveloped, country.
Criticisms are being made in China.
When, in connection with my official visit as chairman of the European Parliament' s China delegation, I recently visited China, I was able, on the fringes of this visit, to meet authors of books which are very highly critical of China' s accession to the WTO.
Both books are published by legal publishing houses and, obviously, in Chinese.
One of the books is known in English translation as Collision: Globalisation and China' s Reality Choice.
The author, who is an economist at Beijing Aeronautic University, maintains that China will lose to a system that is dominated by transnational companies.
His sympathies are with the lower social classes, he says, and he believes that Chinese companies will be swallowed by transnational giants.
This will hit those groups of people in China which have little in the way of wealth.
His main argument is that China is not ready for accession to the WTO.
The Chinese economy is not strong enough, and it will be the poorest classes that will have to pay a heavy price in the form of unemployment and social insecurity.
This book attracted a certain amount of attention in China when it was published last year.
A relevant article was published in the journal belonging to the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the book received many positive reviews.
The second book is known in English as China in the Shadow of Globalisation and constitutes a warning to the effect that accession to the WTO might cause China to split into five parts.
That is one of the things that the Chinese leaders fear most.
The fact that the chaos which might result from accession to the WTO could lead to the division of the country touches a sensitive point in China' s understanding of itself.
In spite of the fact that China is not a democracy and, to put it mildly, does not allow complete freedom of expression, and despite the fact that the Chinese government is in favour of accession to the WTO, a book of this type was nonetheless allowed to be published.
That means that there is uneasiness, considerable uneasiness, in Chinese society.
This uneasiness is, in all likelihood, about the possible consequences within the governing party, too.
You only have to log on to the Internet.
There are many web sites: China Online, South China Morning Post and such like. There is a lot of information about what different commentators, including those outside China, believe might happen because of accession to the WTO.
China Online reported, for example, in August of this year, that approximately 18 per cent of the total number of employees within the State sector are estimated to be surplus to requirements.
It is said that they will be still more surplus to requirements following accession to the WTO.
Unemployment in city areas is already estimated at over 15 per cent.
This report from China Online also maintains that unemployment will increase further in connection with accession to the WTO.
The prospects for new jobs are very limited because those who are made redundant are often older, unqualified workers.
According to China Online, an estimated 30% of the agricultural labour force is surplus to requirements, meaning that 120 million farmers will have to look for jobs in the cities.
Agriculture was one of the most important areas raised by China in the negotiations.
China received certain concessions.
Many commentators still believe, however, that accession will lead to enormous changes in the countryside and have enormous consequences when China is opened up to imports of food and agricultural products from, for example, the United States.
China has nine hundred million people employed within agriculture.
The Chinese government itself, which does not exactly exaggerate the difficulties, estimates that, because of cheaper grain imports, 9.7 million farmers will lose their jobs within seven years of Beijing joining the WTO.
I could go on at length quoting and referring to different sources indicating the difficulties for China, but I think these examples suffice.
The point of the quotations is that I, again, wanted to emphasise how odd I think it is that the Commission should be presenting the Council and Parliament with a document in which there is not a single word to suggest that accession to the WTO might lead to difficulties in the world' s most heavily populated country.
That is an odd information policy, in my opinion.
China' s accession to the WTO may, of course, lead to problems for ourselves, too, if stability in China is seriously undermined.
What conclusions do I draw, then?
I do not draw the conclusion that we must say 'no' .
Even if China is not a democracy in our sense of the word, I think it would be unreasonable for us to try to assume the responsibilities of the Chinese government and say that, what the Chinese government has judged to be correct might, in actual fact, be wrong.
Nonetheless, I believe that we should be aware of the fact that we are embarking upon an incredibly risky game.
It places great demands upon European companies to be responsible and not misuse the opportunities they are given when they now go into China with the freedom granted to them by the latter' s membership of the WTO.
In spite of this serious criticism and these serious misgivings, I naturally recommend that we vote in favour of China' s membership.
I only have a small amount of speaking time left to devote to Taiwan.
That was intentional, because Taiwan is in a quite different situation.
Taiwan is a developed modern democracy, a developed modern market economy and industrial state and the world' s tenth largest trading power.
I cannot see any real problems with Taiwan' s accession to the WTO.
We are concerned there, with an entirely different set of problems with which no comparison can be drawn.
Taiwan will be accorded a local collective agreement with China and become a member the day after China has become a member.
I have no comment other than that we naturally ought to vote in favour of Taiwan' s membership.
Mr President, our group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left supports the two proposals presented without question, both for the People' s Republic of China and for the customs territory of Taipei, and agrees with all the arguments and pertinent issues put forward by Mr Gahrton, who has a profound knowledge of this issue.
For this reason, we think it is of fundamental importance that the European Union should take an extremely responsible attitude when facing this momentous challenge for the world.
The People' s Republic of China' s accession to the World Trade Organisation will have repercussions in China itself, as we have already seen.
They have now had many years to prepare for and take control of the possible consequences.
There will also be significant repercussions for the European Union: I am aware, for example, of what could happen to us with regard to agriculture.
There will also be repercussions for the functioning of the World Trade Organisation, which is going to be completely restructured, although it must be said that this is already a matter of some urgency.
For this reason, although we are aware of the whole range of problems, dangers and possibilities that this accession brings, our group supports these two proposals without reservation.
Mr President, Commissioner, what a pity that such an important issue is again being debated at such a late hour and, needless to say, before almost empty benches, because the repercussions of the accession of the People's Republic of China to the WTO are of global significance in every sense of the word and therefore deserve even more attention.
The history of the creation of the World Trade Organisation can be traced back a long way, to a time when the Second World War had left a trail of destruction in its wake and there was a great deal of uncertainty as to what shape peace would take in the future.
The key elements for a peaceful world, and this was as clear then as it is now, are freedom, security and stability, democracy and human rights.
We have used these basic principles to lay the ghosts of the past in Western Europe and finally bring about an era of peace of which, in my view, we can be proud.
But we have to defend this peace anew every day, a painful lesson each and every one of us now has to learn.
Today we are on the threshold of major enlargement of the European Union.
In a few years, we shall live in a Europe which can be an area of stability and freedom.
But how shall we achieve this?
We shall achieve it through integration.
Integration means inclusion, unification, political, as well as economic, completion.
I do not think anyone disputes the fact that this is an absolutely winning recipe for peaceful development and that this does not just apply to Europe.
Other parts of the world have not been blessed with peace in the last 50 years.
The Cold War was synonymous with conflict and discord for numerous regions in the world.
We must bear this in mind if we are to understand the significance, today, of an organisation, such as, the WTO.
Here, too, the watchword is integration.
The more countries commit themselves to the peaceful principles of trade, the more stable and peaceful the world can become.
For these reasons, I expressly welcome the accession of the People's Republic of China to the WTO.
For the same reason, I also welcome the accession of Taiwan to the World Trade Organisation.
We want to integrate, not leave part of the world standing on the doorstep.
The EU has clearly formulated the important objectives in its strategy on Asia.
Political dialogue with the People's Republic of China should be stepped up, the transition to an open society should be supported and China should be further integrated into the global economy.
This last objective is now within reach.
Only with China, both the People's Republic and Taiwan, will the WTO become a real world trade organisation.
I can assure you that we shall not lose sight of the other objectives and I would also stress that this includes dialogue about human rights.
The numerous negative aspects of China's accession to the WTO, which you choose to identify in your explanatory statement, Mr Gahrton, cannot be supported by us in the PPE-DE Group in their present one-sided and, in my view, somewhat disproportionate wording.
I think the advantages to all sides of these accessions outweigh the disadvantages.
The award of the 2008 Olympic Games to Beijing became as acute a topic of discussion as the accession to the WTO is now.
But I am positive that we are on the right path, the path of integration, not segregation, the path of inclusion, not isolation, the path, I trust, towards a more peaceful world, which we need, today, more than ever.
We are still in shock from the horror of 11 September.
And that is another reason to stand together.
Mr President, my thanks to the Commissioner for the work which he has carried out.
Of course we welcome China and Taiwan, because I think we should be pleased, as the previous speaker said, that China and Taiwan are joining.
A whole host of reforms is being initiated, as the Commission has rightly pointed out.
For the rest, China will take up a key position within the WTO and this will also bring about considerable changes for the West.
I am fairly certain that this will present the Commission with further challenges.
For the rest, we are supporting the accession of China with considerable funds and I think we should do more here.
For the first time, Parliament has been consulted.
This is a result of excellent collaboration with the Commission and, of course, with the Council.
But I have one thing to say to Mr Gahrton: it is true that accession to the WTO is not without its opponents in China.
But I think that to overemphasise this in the report without, at the same time, trusting in the fact that China is more than capable of evaluating whether or not it is in a position to cope with accession is to underestimate China's capabilities considerably.
I rather think that the doomsday scenario which you have conjured up in your report is highly exaggerated.
I would like to see you evaluate matters in a somewhat fairer and more balanced manner in the future.
Mr President, after fifteen years of negotiations, we are now in the final stage of China and Taiwan' s accession to the WTO.
The Commission submitted the accession conditions to you for your opinion.
I would like to thank the House, in particular, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the rapporteur, Mr Gahrton, for your willingness to treat this subject as a priority.
If you accept the recommendation of your rapporteur, the Union will be in a position to give the green light to China' s accession at the next Ministerial Conference of the WTO, which, as you know, will take place in Doha on 9-13 November.
The documents you have been issued with, will have informed you of all the technical elements of the negotiation.
I will not return to them today, but I would like to share with you some thoughts of a more political nature, at the same time giving my reaction to Mr Gahrton' s document and speech; they both warrant it.
I would, firstly, like to stress the special nature of negotiations for accession to the WTO and try to correct the impression - created by your report, Mr Gahrton - that it is something which we have handled in an excessively unilateral fashion.
An accession to the WTO is not negotiated within a traditional multilateral framework, where concessions are made on the basis of the principle of reciprocity.
On the contrary, in an accession negotiation, at least to the WTO (I say that prudently, since this seat was occupied by Günter Verheugen less than an hour ago), a country puts itself forward as a candidate to join a club whose members have already negotiated commitments amongst themselves.
The candidate country must therefore pay for entry into that club by offering commitments in terms of access to markets which reflect what the members have already accepted amongst themselves.
On several occasions your report points out, and with a degree of reproach which has not escaped me, the positive tone taken by the Commission to describe the results we have achieved after fifteen years of negotiations.
Even if, contrary to what the report says, the Commission' s report is not jubilant, I nevertheless believe that we can be satisfied with these results as a job well done.
Our task was primarily to defend the interests of the Union in these negotiations, and that is what we have done.
It is also the case, however, that this agreement is not some kind of unilateral victory for the Union, which is something, if I have understood correctly, that you rather reproach us for.
If there has been any victory, I am tempted to say that it is a multilateral one, since it is the multilateral system as a whole which has been strengthened as a result.
We cannot claim that the WTO has a global vocation if it excludes a country which represents more than 20% of the world' s population.
The issue was not, therefore, whether China should join the WTO, but rather when.
Well, after fifteen long years of negotiations, the different parties involved, China and its trading partners, have reached the conclusion that that time has arrived.
One of the Union' s main objectives was that these negotiations should lead to a strengthening of the multilateral system.
It was therefore necessary for China to accept what we could describe as the multilateral acquis, and I will not make any controversial parallel here either, in other words, the advances made within the framework of GATT and then the WTO over the last half a century.
We have ensured that the level of Chinese commitments offers this guarantee.
But this accession to the WTO is also a victory for China, since we believe it to be an essential condition if she is to continue her exceptional economic development.
Chinese external trade has increased by an average of 15% per year over the last twenty years.
It is, therefore, literally an explosion.
And accession to the WTO ensures China a stable framework for her commercial policy by guaranteeing the outlets which are crucial to her.
Her status as a member will also allow her to defend her commercial interests by participating fully in the round of negotiations.
At the end of the day it is clear that accession to the WTO is only one element, perhaps an essential one, but, nevertheless, only one element in the reform process launched by Deng Xiaoping in 1978 and continued by his successors.
More than an end in itself, accession is a consequence of these past reforms and a springboard for new reforms to come.
The justification for these reforms does not lie in accession to the WTO, and I feel that it would probably be presumptuous to try to distinguish between, what would result from accession itself, and, what is connected to the reform process taking place in China.
This close connection between the timetable for internal reforms and accession to the WTO has been recognised by China' s trading partners, the Union, in particular, by means of the acceptance of transitional periods for the implementation of certain obligations.
In fact, our objective was more the eventual result rather than the speed with which that result comes about.
Mr Gahrton, you referred to two works which stress the dangers which may arise in China as a result of accession to the WTO in terms of regional tensions or social problems.
I do not believe that these problems are being underestimated by the Chinese authorities, whose fundamental political objective seems to me, to be to guarantee the stability and integrity of their country.
From the conversations I have had with them, I understand that China sees accession to the WTO as an essential element in the continuation of these twenty years of reforms, and, therefore, a continuation of this growth which has allowed internal tensions to be kept under control, here or there.
China' s per capita GDP has multiplied by four over these twenty years.
This is therefore a classic, if specific, case of the relationship between commerce and development.
We all know, and I have often said to you, that commercial liberalisation is a good thing, as long as it is accompanied by the means to translate growth into sustainable development, that is to say, internal social and environmental policies, without which the beneficial effects of commercial liberalisation are not enjoyed.
From this point or view, we believe that China' s accession promotes that type of better internal policy.
I believe that this accession will strengthen the rule of law in China.
The fundamental principles of transparency, non-discrimination, efficient administration and independent judicial control, which are included in the acquis of the WTO, will contribute, we believe, to the positive evolution of China' s economic, legal and social systems.
In any event, for our part, we have been concerned, throughout the process of negotiations, to propose progressive measures which will prevent any particular section of the Chinese economy from being exposed to foreign competition overnight.
In conclusion, I would like to insist on the fact that the result of these negotiations is balanced.
It is true that we have defended European interests, and our document to Council and Parliament reflects that strategy.
No, we have not ignored the consequences for China and for the WTO.
Yes, accession will have a positive impact in terms of the quest for economic development in China, and therefore on the quest for internal reforms.
In any event, it is the Chinese themselves who have chosen to integrate themselves into the international economy, and so much the better.
At the same time we can only rejoice at the fact that, for the first time, Taiwan is becoming a full member of an international organisation, in a way which reflects its economic development and its status as an industrialised country.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will end by saying to the House that these two results are due to the wisdom of my predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, who had made these two accessions one of the priorities of the Union' s commercial policy.
All I have done is finish the work which he had largely and judiciously started.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)
Address by His Holiness the XIVth Dalai-Lama
Your Holiness, it is with great honour and emotion, and in a spirit of universal fraternity, that the European Parliament welcomes you to this Chamber of European democracy and, for the first time, in a formal sitting.
Despite the gravity of the events taking place in Central Asia which have caused you to postpone your intended tour of Europe, you have been kind enough to go ahead with your visit to the European Parliament.
Our House is very appreciative of this mark of interest, your Holiness.
For the enormous majority of the 380 million Europeans of the Union, of all backgrounds, national, ethnic, religious or political, you embody peace and tolerance between nations and religions, as well as the wise ideals of Buddhism, of which you are the highest spiritual authority.
As a young man, 42 years ago, in 1959, faced with the invasion of Tibet, you had to make the heartbreaking decision to flee Lhasa, not in order to abandon your people, but because exile was your only remaining means of defending those people throughout the world.
Inspired by an unfailing philosophical conviction, you also made the very difficult choice not to respond to the invasion with violence and to reconcile, relentlessly and enthusiastically, your unconditional condemnation of the injustice done to Tibet with your appeal to the Chinese authorities for a sincere dialogue.
You draw the strength of your resistance from your spirituality, from a profound respect for mankind and for life, and from your faith in the unity of the world' s human community.
You have brilliantly demonstrated, like Mahatma Gandhi, like Nelson Mandela and like Andrei Sakharov, that the peaceful expression of a noble cause can bring understanding, respect and sometimes victory.
In 1989, the Nobel peace prize symbolised the international community' s recognition of you and your tireless non-violent action.
Thanks to you and your people, throughout the world, Tibet' s cause has never been buried by indifference.
It is perceived as a just cause, and the younger generations are no exception to this.
On 11 September, the world was horrified to see the new face of a monstrous form of terrorism.
Since we have seen how those events have led to the danger of misunderstanding between civilisations, the message which you are to address to the Europeans today is of universal and particularly topical importance.
I am convinced that this message, by means of our Parliament, will have a profound resonance throughout Europe and beyond.
I therefore invite you to take the floor, your Holiness.
(Loud applause)
It is a great honour to speak and share some of my thoughts and feelings with you.
As my prepared statement is in Tibetan, I want to read in Tibetan to show respect for my own unique, separate language.
So I will speak Tibetan.
(Loud applause) Recently, in Calcutta, at a function, at the beginning, as usual, I spoke in Tibetan and then in my broken English.
The next day a local newspaper reported very favourably on my remarks but said that the Dalai Lama spoke at the beginning in Chinese.
So I hope you will realise that this is not Chinese, but the Tibetan language.
(Laughter and applause)
(The speaker continued in Tibetan, what follows is a translation)Madam President, ladies and gentlemen.
It is a great honour for me to address the European Parliament.
I believe the European Union is an inspiring example for a cooperative and peaceful co-existence among different nations and peoples and deeply inspiring for people like myself who strongly believe in the need for better understanding, closer cooperation, and greater respect among the various nations of the world.
I thank you for this kind invitation.
I consider it as an encouraging gesture of genuine sympathy and concern for the tragic fate of the Tibetan people.
I speak to you today as a simple Buddhist monk, educated and trained in our ancient traditional way.
I am not an expert in political science.
However, my life-long study and practice of Buddhism and my responsibility and involvement in the non-violent freedom struggle of the Tibetan people have given me some experiences and thoughts that I would like to share with you.
It is evident that the human community has reached a critical juncture in its history.
Today' s world requires us to accept the oneness of humanity.
In the past, communities could afford to think of one another as fundamentally separate.
But today, as we learn from the recent tragic events in the United States, whatever happens in one region eventually affects many other areas.
The world is becoming increasingly interdependent.
Within the context of this new interdependence, self-interest clearly lies in considering the interest of others.
Without the cultivation and promotion of a sense of universal responsibility our very future is in danger.
I strongly believe that we must consciously develop a greater sense of universal responsibility.
We must learn to work not just for our own individual self, family or nation, but for the benefit of all mankind.
Universal responsibility is the best foundation both for our personal happiness and for world peace, the equitable use of our natural resources, and, through a concern for future generations, the proper care for the environment.
Many of the world´s problems and conflicts arise because we have lost sight of the basic humanity that binds us all together as a human family.
We tend to forget that despite the diversity of race, religion, culture, language, ideology and so forth, people are equal in their basic desire for peace and happiness: we all want happiness and do not want suffering.
We strive to fulfil these desires as best we can.
However, as much as we praise diversity in theory, unfortunately often we fail to respect it in practice.
In fact, our inability to embrace diversity becomes a major source of conflict among peoples.
A particularly sad fact of human history is that conflicts have arisen in the name of religion.
Even today, individuals are killed, their communities destroyed and societies destabilised as a result of misuse of religion and encouragement of bigotry and hatred.
According to my personal experience the best way to overcome obstructions to inter-religious harmony and to bring about understanding is through dialogue with members of other faith traditions.
This I see occurring in a number of different ways.
In my own case, for example, my meetings with the late Thomas Merton, a Trappist monk, in the late 60s, were deeply inspiring.
They helped me develop a profound admiration for the teachings of Christianity.
I also feel that meetings amongst different religious leaders and joining together to pray from a common platform are extremely powerful, as was the case in 1986 during the gathering at Assisi in Italy.
The recent United Nations Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders held last year was also a laudable step.
However, there is a need for more of these initiatives on a regular basis.
On my part, to show my respect for other religious traditions I went on pilgrimage to Jerusalem - a site holy to three of the world' s great religions.
I have paid visits to various Hindu, Islamic, Christian, Jain and Sikh shrines both in India and abroad.
During the past three decades I have met with many religious leaders of different traditions and have discussed harmony and inter-religious understanding.
When exchanges like these occur, followers of one tradition will find that, just as in the case of their own, the teachings of other faiths are a source of both spiritual inspiration and as well as ethical guidance to their followers.
It will also become clear that irrespective of doctrinal and other differences, all the major world religions help to transform individuals to become good human beings.
All emphasise love, compassion, patience, tolerance, forgiveness, humility, self-discipline and so on.
We must therefore embrace the concept of plurality in the field of religion, too.
In the context of our newly emerging global community all forms of violence, including war, are totally inappropriate means of settling disputes.
Violence and war have always been part of human history, and in ancient times there were winners and losers.
However, there would be no winners at all if another global conflict were to occur today.
We must, therefore, have the courage and vision to call for a world without nuclear weapons and national armies in the long run.
(Loud applause)Especially, in the light of the terrible attacks in the United States the international community must make a sincere attempt to use the horrible and shocking experience to develop a sense of global responsibility, where a culture of dialogue and non-violence is used in resolving differences.
Dialogue is the only sensible and intelligent way of resolving differences and clashes of interests, whether between individuals or nations.
The promotion of a culture of dialogue and non-violence for the future of mankind is a compelling task of the international community.
It is not enough for governments to endorse the principle of non-violence without any appropriate action to support and promote it.
If non-violence is to prevail, non-violent movements must be made effective and successful.
Some consider the 20th century a century of war and bloodshed.
I believe the challenge before us is to make the new century one of dialogue and non-violence.
Furthermore, in dealing with conflicts too often we lack proper judgment and courage.
We fail to pay adequate attention to situations of potential conflict when they are at an early stage of development.
Once all the circumstances have progressed to a state where emotions of the people or communities involved in disputes have become fully charged, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to prevent a dangerous situation from exploding.
We see this tragic situation repeated time and again.
So we must learn to detect early signs of conflict and have the courage to address the problem before it reaches its boiling point.
I remain convinced that most human conflicts can be solved through genuine dialogue conducted with a spirit of openness and reconciliation.
I have therefore consistently sought a resolution of the issue of Tibet through non-violence and dialogue.
Right from the beginning of the invasion of Tibet, I tried to work with the Chinese authorities to arrive at a mutually acceptable, peaceful co-existence.
Even when the so-called Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was forced upon us I tried to work with the Chinese authorities.
After all, by that agreement the Chinese government recognised the distinctiveness and the autonomy of Tibet and pledged not to impose their system on Tibet against our wishes.
However, in breach of this agreement, the Chinese authorities forced upon Tibetans their rigid and alien ideology and showed scant respect for the unique culture, religion and way of life of the Tibetan people.
In desperation the Tibetan people rose up against the Chinese.
In the end in 1959 I had to escape from Tibet so that I could continue to serve the people of Tibet.
During the past more than four decades since my escape, Tibet has been under the harsh control of the government of the People´s Republic of China.
The immense destruction and human suffering inflicted on the people of Tibet are today well known and I do not wish to dwell on these sad and painful events.
The late Panchen Lama' s 70,000-character petition to the Chinese government serves as a telling historical document on China' s draconian policies and actions in Tibet.
Tibet today continues to be an occupied country, oppressed by force and scarred by suffering.
Despite some development and economic progress, Tibet continues to face fundamental problems of survival.
Serious violations of human rights are widespread throughout Tibet and are often the result of policies of racial and cultural discrimination.
Yet they are only the symptoms and consequences of a deeper problem.
The Chinese authorities view Tibet' s distinct culture and religion as the source of threat of separation.
Hence as a result of deliberate policies an entire people with its unique culture and identity are facing the threat of extinction.
I have led the Tibetan freedom struggle on a path of non-violence and have consistently sought a mutually agreeable solution of the Tibetan issue through negotiations in a spirit of reconciliation and compromise with China.
With this spirit in 1988 here in Strasbourg at this Parliament I presented a formal proposal for negotiations, which we hoped would serve as a basis for resolving the issue of Tibet.
I had chosen consciously the European Parliament as a venue to present my thoughts for a framework for negotiations in order to underline the point that a genuine union can only come about voluntarily when there are satisfactory benefits to all the parties concerned.
The European Union is a clear and inspiring example of this.
On the other hand, even one country or community can break into two or more entities when there is a lack of trust and benefit, and when force is used as the principal means of rule.
My proposal which later became known as the 'Middle Way Approach' or the 'Strasbourg Proposal' envisages that Tibet enjoy genuine autonomy within the framework of the People' s Republic of China.
However, not the autonomy on paper imposed on us 50 years ago in the 17-Point Agreement, but a true self-governing, genuinely autonomous Tibet, with Tibetans fully responsible for their own domestic affairs, including the education of their children, religious matters, cultural affairs, the care of their delicate and precious environment, and the local economy.
Beijing would continue to be responsible for the conduct of foreign and defence affairs.
This solution would greatly enhance the international image of China and contribute to her stability and unity -- the two topmost priorities of Beijing -- while at the same time the Tibetans would be ensured of the basic rights and freedoms to preserve their own civilisation and to protect the delicate environment of the Tibetan plateau.
Since then our relation with the Chinese government has taken many twists and turns.
Unfortunately, I must sadly inform you that a lack of political will on the part of the Chinese leadership to address the issue of Tibet in a serious manner has failed to produce any progress.
My initiatives and overtures over the years to engage the Chinese leadership in a dialogue remain unreciprocated.
Last September, I communicated through the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi our wish to send a delegation to Beijing to deliver a detailed memorandum outlining my thinking on the issue of Tibet and to explain and discuss the points raised in the memorandum.
I conveyed that through face-to-face meetings we would succeed in clarifying misunderstandings and overcoming distrust.
I expressed the strong belief that once this is achieved then a mutually acceptable solution of the problem can be found without much difficulty.
But the Chinese government is refusing to accept my delegation till today.
It is obvious that Beijing' s attitude has hardened significantly compared to the eighties when six Tibetan delegations from exile were accepted.
Whatever explanations Beijing may give concerning communications between the Chinese government and myself I must state here clearly that the Chinese government is refusing to talk to the representatives I have designated for the task.
The failure of the Chinese leadership to respond positively to my Middle Way Approach reaffirms the Tibetan people' s suspicion that the Chinese government has no interest whatsoever in any kind of peaceful co-existence.
Many Tibetans believe that China is bent on complete forceful assimilation and absorption of Tibet into China.
They call for the independence of Tibet and criticise my 'Middle Way Approach' .
Others are advocating a referendum in Tibet.
They argue if conditions inside Tibet are as the Chinese authorities portray it to be and if the Tibetans are truly happy, then there should be no difficulty holding a plebiscite in Tibet.
I have also always maintained that ultimately the Tibetan people must be able to decide about the future of Tibet as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, stated in the Indian Parliament on December 7.
1950: "...the last voice in regard to Tibet should be the voice of the people of Tibet and nobody else."
While I firmly reject the use of violence as a means in our freedom struggle we certainly have the right to explore all other political options available to us.
I am a staunch believer in freedom and democracy and have therefore been encouraging the Tibetans in exile to follow the democratic process.
Today, the Tibetan refugees may be among the few communities in exile that have established all the three pillars of democracy: legislature, judiciary and executive.
This year we have taken another big stride in the process of democratisation by having the chairman of the Tibetan Cabinet elected by popular vote.
The elected chairman of the Cabinet and the elected parliament will shoulder the responsibility of running the Tibetan affairs as the legitimate representatives of the people.
However, I consider it my moral obligation to the six million Tibetans to continue taking up the Tibetan issue with the Chinese leadership and to act as the free spokesman of the Tibetan people until a solution is reached.
In the absence of any positive response from the Chinese government to my overtures over the years, I am left with no alternative but to appeal to the members of the international community.
It is clear now that only increased, concerted and consistent international efforts will persuade Beijing to change its policy on Tibet.
Although the immediate reactions from the Chinese side will be most probably negative, nevertheless, I strongly believe that expressions of international concern and support are essential for creating an environment conducive for the peaceful resolution of the Tibetan problem.
On my part, I remain committed to the process of dialogue.
It is my firm belief that dialogue and a willingness to look with honesty and clarity at the reality of Tibet can lead us to a mutually beneficial solution that will contribute to the stability and unity of the People' s Republic of China and secure the right for the Tibetan people to live in freedom, peace and dignity.
Brothers and sisters of the European Parliament, I consider myself as the free spokesman for my captive countrymen and women.
It is my duty to speak on their behalf.
I speak not with a feeling of anger or hatred towards those who are responsible for the immense suffering of our people and the destruction of our land, homes, temples, monasteries and culture.
They too are human beings who struggle to find happiness, and deserve our compassion.
I speak to inform you of the sad situation in my country today and of the aspirations of my people, because in our struggle for freedom, truth is the only weapon we possess.
Today, our people, our distinct rich cultural heritage and our national identity are facing the threat of extinction.
We need your support to survive as a people and as a culture.
When one looks at the situation inside Tibet it seems almost hopeless in the face of increasing repression, continuing environmental destruction, and the ongoing systematic undermining of the culture and identity of Tibet.
Yet I believe that no matter how big and powerful China may be she is still part of the world.
The global trend today is towards more openness, freedom, democracy and respect for human rights.
Sooner or later China will have to follow the world trend and in the long run there is no way that China can escape from truth, justice and freedom.
The consistent and principled engagement of the European Parliament with China will accelerate this process of change that is already taken place in China.
Since the Tibetan issue is closely related with what is happening in China, I believe there is reason and ground for hope.
I would like to thank the European Parliament for the consistent display of concern and support for the non-violent Tibetan freedom struggle.
Your sympathy and support have always been a deep source of inspiration and encouragement to the Tibetan people both inside and outside Tibet.
The numerous resolutions of the European Parliament on the issue of Tibet helped greatly to highlight the plight of the Tibetan people and raise the awareness of the public and governments in Europe and around the world of the issue of Tibet.
I am especially encouraged by the European Parliament' s resolution calling for the appointment of an EU special representative for Tibet.
I strongly believe that the implementation of this resolution will enable the European Union not only to help promote a peaceful resolution of the Tibetan issue through negotiations in a more consistent, effective and creative way but also provide support for other legitimate needs of the Tibetan people, including ways and means to preserve our distinct identity.
This initiative will also send a strong signal to Beijing that the European Union is serious in encouraging and promoting a solution of the Tibetan problem.
I have no doubt that your continued expressions of concern and support for Tibet will in the long run impact positively and help create the conducive political environment for a constructive dialogue on the issue of Tibet.
I ask for your continued support in this critical time in our country' s history.
I thank you for providing me the opportunity to share my thoughts with you.
(The House rose and accorded the speaker a standing ovation)
As you can see, your Holiness, we are all very moved and I would like to thank you, on behalf of the European Parliament, for the great, noble message you have just addressed to us.
You have been kind enough to point out that the European Parliament has always supported your action and your people.
We have seen that you are well acquainted with the resolutions we have voted for in Parliament, always by a huge majority, if not practically unanimously, including as recently as last February.
It is true that we realise, as you have pointed out, that the Tibetan people are being deprived of their fundamental freedoms, threatened with the destruction of their monasteries, which forge their moral and spiritual souls, and are threatened by a policy of marginalising the Tibetan people.
You have reminded us of all these things, and you have told us very frankly that, unfortunately, the hand held out to the Chinese authorities has so far been ignored, and we have also noted, your Holiness, that you have never lost hope.
You have this concern, but at the same time the great hope that the day will come when China, on opening up to the rest of the world, will finally hear your appeal, and that is a wish which we passionately share, but we can only join you in your desire, your Holiness.
We have clearly heard the powerful appeal you have made to us.
You have told us that if the international community, in this case the European Community, can join you in your efforts, perhaps the result we all wish to see could be within reach.
I would simply like to assure you that you can count on the active support of our European Parliament, on the active support of our political groups, on the active support of the intergroup which, as you know, has been created precisely to further strengthen our friendship with the Tibetan people.
You can count on our support, you can count on our indestructible loyalty so that, in the spirit of your proposals, Tibet can regain its freedom.
Thank you again, your Holiness, for your presence and your message.
(Loud applause) (The formal sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)
Madam President, I should like to put a point of order before Parliament today, at a time when we are about to vote on the most important act we are called upon to approve, that is, the budget.
Nine people died yesterday in the St Gotthard tunnel because of a road accident.
This places a greater onus on us when - under the heading of 'infrastructure' - we come to vote on the much-needed and now ever more pressing engineering works which must be Europe' s response to the problem of traffic across the Alpine passes.
Today we shall be debating the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel, with all the economic and environmental problems that involves.
Let us also remind ourselves of this: the incident in the St Gotthard tunnel was caused to a great extent by the additional volumes traffic that the St Gotthard, Brenner and other Alpine passes have had to absorb as a result of the closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel.
We must therefore vote with conviction for the infrastructure funding to speed up the procedure involved in rebuilding the Brenner rail tunnel and the Fréjus rail tunnel, and move road vehicles onto trains, with benefits for the safety of those who travel and also for the surrounding environment.
Let us remember that when we vote.
Of course, Mr Santini.
VOTE
Madam President, I am against this oral amendment.
(With more than twelve Members standing, the oral amendment was not considered) Following the vote
Madam President, there has just been some enthusiastic applause because this vote has ended.
I can understand why, as this is always a protracted event.
However, I would like to ask you to put one other amendment to the vote.
I should have said this at the beginning, but we were already proceeding with the voting.
It is about the Court of Auditors.
We have now voted on an amount of 1 million in the line to build an extension for the Court of Auditors.
As the Committee on Budgets, we would like to ask for another EUR 6 million to be entered in the reserve so that additional capital can be injected during the coming year.
This will ultimately produce considerable savings for the taxpayer and will also create extra scope in future budgets.
I would also like to ask you to put this last amendment to the vote, which entails entering a further EUR 6 million in the reserve in budget line 206.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Report (A5-0330/2001) by Mr Costa Neves, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2002 (C5-0300/2001 - 2000/2324(BUD)) and Letter of amendment No 1/2002 (12733/2001 - C5-0495/2001) to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2002 (Section III - Commission)
Following the vote
Madam President, the vote has now been taken, but during the vote on the budget, we spoke against this idea and, as a result, this item was removed from the budget.
We are now voting in favour of this paragraph, which is not how we voted on the budget.
There is, therefore, a contradiction now, of which the House must be aware.
The fact is, however, that the vote has been taken.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0329/2001) by Mrs Buitenweg, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2002 (C5-0300/2001 - 2000/2325(BUD)) and Letter of amendment No 1/2002 (12733/2001 - C5-0495/2001) to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2002
Section I - European Parliament
Section II - Council
Section IV - Court of Justice
Section V - Court of Auditors
Section VI - Economic and Social Committee
Section VII - Committee of the Regions
Section VIII (A) - European Ombudsman
Section VIII (B) - European Data Protection Supervisor
With regard to Paragraph 39
Mrs Buitenweg, you have an oral amendment, I think, on Paragraph 39, following the vote on the budget. Would you be so kind as to explain this to us once more, so that we can proceed to the vote?
I will do it in English.
It is about what I originally said about the conditions under which we will release the amounts or the items which we entered in the reserve in the last vote.
These are the conditions specified in Amendment No 73 of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
This is in accordance with what we discussed earlier, and this is the most straightforward way.
We must therefore amend the text in the way we have just voted.
It says:
"The money can be released after a favourable opinion from Parliaments' committee responsible for the relations with the Court of Auditors, once the Court has given updated information on its current staffing problems and on how additional staff would enable the Court to assess the performance of financial control systems in the candidate countries, improve its cooperation with the national audit institutions (requirement of Treaty of Nice) and establish more detailed specific DAS assessment."
(The President noted that there was no opposition to the oral amendment being considered)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Madam President, on Tuesday Mrs Morgan raised the issue of the letter that the Bureau sent to Mr Prodi on reform of the Commission, taking a very different stance from the position taken by the Commission.
We have just voted on the report by Mrs Buitenweg and have approved Amendment No 4 by Mr Elles, which reiterates Parliament's wholehearted support for the Commission reforms.
Will you now write to Mr Prodi and convey to him the reconfirmed, wholehearted support of this Parliament for radical reforms of the Commission's staff regulations?
Madam President, I think that we have all noticed from your tone of voice that you have shown a great deal of personal stoicism in presiding over this part-session despite your ill health.
I would like to say, on behalf of all the 'budgeteers' and in the name, I believe, of all my fellow Members, that we are very grateful to you for presiding over the votes on the budget in the first and second reading.
Madam President, I of course share the sentiments expressed by Mr Bourlanges.
However, we have to look into the question asked by Mr van Hulten, because, when it was raised by Mrs Morgan earlier on this week when Mr Provan was in the chair, he said he would examine whether it was possible to see what was going to happen.
Therefore, maybe you could respond to Mr van Hulten' s question and possibly discuss this matter with the Bureau, that will meet to clarify the situation.
Mr President, I am sorry Mrs Fontaine had to leave, so perhaps you would pass on my remarks to her.
As the House will know, I spent a great deal of time studying the reform process on behalf of the House last year and continued to follow it through the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I understand exactly the points that Mrs Fontaine made but, I ask you, on behalf of all Members of this House, to keep us better informed of the process.
This was the point that I raised back in September when I asked the presidency to give us the same level of information about the progress of the reforms as we are receiving from the Commission.
Mr Kinnock has given us a comprehensive timetable about the progress of the reform discussions.
This House, these Members, have no information whatsoever from the Bureau about the reform process.
I ask you to be much more transparent and to give us a progress report on these reforms.
Mr President, on behalf of my colleagues in the Socialist and the Christian Democratic Group I would like to make an oral amendment to paragraph 9.
It should read as follows: "...welcomes the fact that the Commission came forward with the announced packet of the three climate change proposals".
The Commission came forward the day before yesterday with the three proposals, we have to correct that.
I also want to congratulate the Commission for doing this before the very important climate change conference in Marrakesh, COP 7.
(The President noted that there was no opposition to considering the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0326/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position on the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing harmonised requirements and procedures for the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers (7193/2/2001 - C5-0292/2001 - 2000/0121(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr van Dam)

Report (A5-0343/2001) by Mr Lamassoure, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the 2000 Regular Report from the Commission on Turkey' s progress towards accession (COM (2000)713 - C5-0613/2000 - 2000/2014(COS)
On Amendment No 8
Mr President, by agreement with the rapporteur I would like to make an oral amendment.
I only have the English text with me now.
It should read: "Insists on the immediate abolition of the death penalty..." instead of "Reiterates its call for the immediate abolition of the death penalty..."
(The President noted that there was no opposition to considering the oral amendment) On paragraph 10
Mr President, for the sake of compromise here, too, we would like to propose the following, which is submitted with the rapporteur' s cooperation and agreement.
It should read: " Urges Turkey to propose in the coming year a precise timetable ...", in other words we would insert: "in the coming year".
(The President noted that there was no opposition to considering the oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0366/2001) by Mr Gahrton, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing the Community's position in the Ministerial Conference set up by the accord creating the World Trade Organisation, with regard to the accession of the People's Republic of China to the World Trade Organisation (COM(2001) 517 - C5-0487/2001 - 2001/0218(CNS))

Motion for a resolution (B5-0695/2001), by Mr Wurtz, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the conclusions of the Ghent European Council of 19 October
Mr President, I want to make a point on the European Council in Ghent.
It is a suggestion from the ELDR Group, the Greens and the Socialists on paragraph 7, where we each have tabled an amendment, Amendments Nos 13, 9 and 5 respectively. The suggestion is an oral amendment to merge all of them to add at the end of paragraph 7: "which adequately represents women, respects their human rights and ensures that Afghan women participate fully in building such a future".
The only problem, Mrs Ludford, is that we are at present dealing with a resolution by our Group.
We have not yet moved on to the joint motion for a resolution, so you are jumping ahead.
We must first ascertain whether or not there is a majority on the first resolution.
(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution on the results of the informal meeting of the European Council held at Ghent on 19 October 2001.
Mr President, I would like to ask for an explanation as to whether, when the amendments are merged, the word "commitment" should be kept in the text as set out in the Socialist amendment.
In other words, it would be "a commitment" to do this.
I think the implication is that this is the case, that the word "commitment" should also appear in the merged text.
Mr President, one of the reasons that I was motivated to suggest this oral amendment which brings the three together is that in the English text, the Socialist amendment does not read very well.
When it says we should include a "compromise in favour of Afghan women", that, in English, could be read as suggesting that we compromise the interests of Afghan women.
It is not a happy wording in English.
It means a settlement.
"Compromise" is not a good translation of "compromis".
That was one of the reasons why I ventured to suggest that we try to merge the three and therefore, in English, we get rid of the word "compromise", which is ambiguous.
Mr President, I would just like to make a correction of a linguistic nature.
The translation into English of the Spanish word 'compromiso' is 'commitment' and not 'compromise' .

On Amendment No 6

Mr President, I would like to point out that we, the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats, tabled Amendment No 6 to recital A and that we want the words "supply constraints" in the fourth line of the English text to be replaced by the word "quotas" because that is the correct term.
(The President noted that there was no opposition to considering the oral amendment) On Amendment No 3
Mr President, I want to move an oral amendment, with the agreement of the rapporteur, to tidy up Amendment No 3 so that it now reads: "...calls for a commitment by the world leaders gathered at the WTO to coordinate measures to help developing countries tackle the impediments to growth...", etc.
Are any Members opposed to this oral amendment being considered?
Mr President, by agreement with the proposers I would like to ask that we keep "looks to the Member States" and add "and the Council" .
Is there any opposition to the addition of "and by the Council"?
There seems not to be.
We will therefore include this oral suggestion.
(The President noted that there was no opposition to considering the oral amendment) On Amendment No 15
Mr President, I have been requested to put an oral amendment.
In the spirit of compromise and in order for this amendment to passed, I suggest that we add on the end of paragraph 37: "and to assist in the fight against terrorism".
(The President noted that there was no opposition to considering the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
General Budget for 2002
. (NL) During the vote on the 2002 draft budget, the delegation of the Dutch People' s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) in the ELDR group stated that it was against the increase in the category 2 payment appropriations.
The European Commission stated that these increases could not be absorbed by the corresponding budget lines, and furthermore that these increases would result in higher contributions for Member States.
The VVD delegation therefore does not regard this increase in payment appropriations as necessary.
Nevertheless, the delegation did vote in favour of the increase in the category 2 commitment appropriations because it is of the opinion that proper programming of the structural funds is needed.
We have generally voted against the Committee' s proposal to increase the agricultural expenditure in category 1.
We think it unreasonable that approximately half the EU' s total annual budget should go on subsidising the production and export of agricultural products.
Today' s common agricultural policy is not only expensive for the EU, it also contributes to higher consumer prices.
The agricultural sector is, moreover, well protected from competition from foreign imports. This has a very distorting and destabilising effect on the world economy.
The EU' s common agricultural policy constitutes, above all, a problem for the developing countries, for agriculture is an area in which the developing countries are competitive in relation to the industrialised world' s producers.
The EU' s common agricultural policy presents major obstacles for the developing countries, partly due to the fact that the agriculture concerned is subsidised and protected against competition in the form of imports.
The fact that the EU also subsidises tobacco cultivation is particularly anomalous.
Subsidies for tobacco cultivation should be abolished as soon as possible.
The EU' s activity and budget should instead be directed at cross-border problems which the Member States themselves cannot solve.
The common agricultural policy shows a lack of solidarity with the developing countries and must be reformed immediately.
Costa Neves Report (A5-0330/2001)
Mr President, the radical Members have a certain reputation for efficiency which my explanation of vote will go some way towards dispelling, as we made a mistake, a serious mistake, in the Budget vote, in respect of Amendment No 75 on the contribution to the funding of European political parties.
Whilst being signatories to this amendment, which was intended to abolish the Budget line in question - because we not only believe that the idea of funding of European political parties is not at present justified, but there is no legal basis for it - we voted against the amendment which we had ourselves proposed.
My explanation is therefore intended to correct, as far as possible, the result of the vote.
We have already asked for the record to be adjusted.
There is a mistake in our list of votes, which we are keen to put right.
Otherwise, we judge the Costa Neves report in a positive light, but we were keen to emphasise this minor technical error with regard to Amendment No 75.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you, Mr Dell'Alba.
The House had been wondering.
Now it is completely enlightened.
Mr President, should I give up making explanations of vote just because I have lost my voice?
With regard to the budget, I should like to say something about the section on the Commission.
I voted for it, but this will be the last time, because I want to get some light on how the Commission works.
On 1 January 2002 I shall set off on a long journey, like Odysseus when the Trojan War ended, through the maze of bureaucracy in the 13 523 offices of the Commission and its 33 728 staff.
It will be a long, hard and difficult journey: I shall meet Polyphemus, I shall meet Circe, the sorceress, and perhaps in the end I shall see Penelope looking like our President Prodi.
It will certainly be a shock, but I hope to be able to vote for it again next time.
Mr President, I voted for Mrs Buitenweg' s report on the budget, but I should like to stress very strongly and loudly here in Parliament, with so many members present on this occasion, that the Pensioners' Party - which I have the honour to represent in this House - believes that the European Parliament, which now legislates on fifty per cent of all national laws, which are adaptations to the directives that we approve here, should have greater funding and better organisation in order to function as befits a supranational Parliament, a Parliament with so many important duties.
- (FI) I, together with my group, supported the change over to a reimbursement system based on receipted costs with regard to reimbursement of travel expenses, secretarial costs and office costs.
My group interprets the wording used in the first amendment to mean that there is now no proper procedure at all.
At the same time, the amendment totally ignores the fact that the decision is now in the hands of the Council. Parliament has proposed the procedure intended by this amendment and is prepared to adopt it, but the Council has not been able to give the necessary approval.
On the basis of the above, my group feels that the amendment puts Parliament in a bad light, unduly and unfairly.
Budget debates are great moments for Parliament because they afford us an opportunity to make a comprehensive review of past and future policy.
Unfortunately time does not allow me to do so.
I would therefore like to confine myself to just one point, that is the situation in the border regions of the Member States adjoining the candidate countries.
It is beyond question that today' s border regions will benefit from European Union enlargement in the long term since there will be totally new opportunities for economic, cultural, social and administrative regional cooperation.
Nevertheless, in the short term there will be tremendous pressure as they adjust to specific problems arising out of the very different levels of development, especially in the social field.
I need only point out that the earnings gap between East and West is around 60%.
This raises questions that did not arise with earlier enlargements and which take on a new dimension.
The anticipated problems on the local labour and service markets will not be overcome without a great deal of effort.
Large numbers of daily commuters will put enormous pressure on an already tight labour market - in Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania alone unemployment rates in excess of 20% are quite common.
Cheap services with wage costs around 60% lower will be a tremendous challenge for SMEs and craft trades.
Local and regional governments and administrations believe that the Commission' s proposed programme of assistance to border regions fails to match the scale of the challenge.
I therefore welcome the inclusion of a special budget line for border regions.
But I also call for additional Union funding to be made available as quickly as possible to reassure the border region citizens affected that their concerns and needs are not going unnoticed.
We need a basis in law, and the Commission must create it very quickly.
Seppänen Report (A5-0342/2001)
.
(FR) As is plain to see, we voted against the ECSC budget, which, as it will do until the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, continues to pump subsidies to shareholders in the steel industry.
Substantial sums have already been handed out to the bosses in this sector, allowing them to move over to lucrative new sectors, while many of the workers whose jobs have been abolished are still unemployed.
This report proposes the integration of social security assistance into the Budget of the European Union; but there is a need to guarantee, as a minimum, that all the workers affected by future job losses will receive the whole of their salary up to the age of retirement.
van Dam Report (A5-0326/2001)
Mr President, you know - as, I believe, everybody does - that in the early years of my working life I was a seaman.
I am therefore particularly concerned about safety and the safeguarding of human life at sea, and not only at sea but also when freight is being unloaded from ships in port.
This document is attempting to do something to improve safety for the lives of the seamen who work in ports.
Ports are very important for Italy - especially the port of Genoa, where I was born, and the port of Livorno, where I was a short time ago. All ports are important, like the port of Marseille and those on the other coasts of Europe, which is the union of countries that has the largest number of seafaring people.
We must continue to do everything possible to safeguard human lives at sea, as we are doing in this document.
Vatanen Report (A5-0327/2001)
Mr President, I voted for the report by my friend Mr Vatanen, who will be disappointed at having been the rapporteur of a document that can do so little for transport; it does, however, do something for bureaucracy.
Well, I would like to tell him: we have not managed to get rid of bureaucracy - and not just in sea transport - but can we manage to get rid of bureaucracy at least in the payment of pensions and the granting of pensions?
Mr President, there are pensioners who die because of bureaucracy, without having drawn their pensions.
Of course, they go to Heaven; they know when they get there.
These pensioners deserve to go to Heaven, as all pensioners do, but it would be better if their pensions arrived while they were still alive!
Lamassoure Report (A5-0338/2001)
Mr President, I voted for the report on aid to Turkey, but I want to say that the Pensioners' Party and I personally ask the European Union to be braver.
The 12 countries that have applied to join the European Union should all be admitted in 2004 without any further conditions, because this would be a courageous political act: they have been waiting for fifty years to feel really European.
Did the six countries that signed the Treaty of Rome, Mr President, have to include the Community acquis in their own statute books before signing?
There was no Community directive, but even so a great Europe was formed through an important political act.
I tell you: we can let in all 12 countries in 2004, whatever their legislative situation may be.
.
I have voted against the Report on Turkey.
Turkey has not yet taken the necessary measures to fully restore the political rights of the Kurdish people, suppress torture and abolish the special security courts and prisons that drive prisoners to go on hunger strikes which have claimed more than 70 victims already.
Turkey has not even fixed a precise timetable for fulfilling the political criteria of Copenhagen.
We are giving up human rights for geopolitical and military reasons.
That is not admissible in a democratic Parliament.
. (NL) Some politicians are keen to bring Turkey into the European Union before that country has radically changed.
They are therefore prepared to turn a blind eye to a number of extremely negative consequences.
Admitting a country like this, which is an exceptional case, will have a fundamental impact on the existing standards for democratic freedom and human rights in the EU.
The rapporteur wanted to create the impression that in Turkey it was a question of minor deficiencies which could be resolved quickly and easily.
Fortunately, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy has adopted a more critical stance, but still not critical enough by far.
In fact, the announced reforms are heading in the right direction, but do not yet go very far at all.
The release of prisoners and the abolition of the death penalty apply to criminal prisoners but not yet to political opponents, whose rights they refuse to recognise.
The mass murder of Armenians is still denied or justified as a normal way of suppressing opposition, which they want to continue to be able to use in the future.
The displaced populations from 3 500 destroyed Kurdish villages in the south-east are not being allowed to return to the area.
Fear of what is called "separatism" results in a language, songs and writings being punishable.
This country is still a long way from being en route to the EU.
.
(FR) The issue of Turkey brings us back with a jolt to the question of what kind of Europe we want.
If the question is framed in terms of membership of a monolithic bloc, the Turkish question will be extremely difficult to resolve.
It will suffice to consider the example of our shared external frontier.
On the hypothesis that Europe will develop steadily towards variable geometry, nothing, then, prevents the involvement of Turkey in certain European policies in fields where there is a real commonality of interests.
If, on the contrary, we hold fast to a rigid conception of the European Union, the only outcome, in the long term, will be the reversal of the decision made at Helsinki and the resumption of an association process with Turkey of the same kind as those we are developing with the other Mediterranean States which geography and history have placed outside Europe.
I am, by the way, astonished to learn, from the Turkish Ambassador, that the rapporteur, Mr Lamassoure, was opposed to the amendments referring to the Armenian genocide, whilst the political group to which he belongs played an active part in having this crime recognised as such by the French National Assembly.
Could this be a case of 'doublespeak' ?
Lamassoure Report (A5-0343/2001)
. (FR) We voted against the Lamassoure Report "on Turkey's progress towards accession" as we cannot see how the rapporteur manages to reconcile Turkey's inclusion and his conception of a federal Europe with strong supranational powers.
The rule of law must in fact relate to the identity of a people, and the practice of democracy falls under this heading.
To date we have still not found a European people. What chance then of a Turco-European people?
In fact, the Lamassoure report's sole merit is that it brings into the cold light of day the contradictions of present-day Europe.
If it proves necessary to establish firm cooperative links with Turkey, this cannot under any circumstances come about through a supranational power enacting regulations uniformly applicable to all, but must result from dialogue between one nation and another, within the European variable-geometry structure.
Moreover, the Lamassoure Report finesses with the recognition of the Armenian genocide of 1917, doubtless aiming to appease Turkey.
We believe there is a need to be more frank and to ask Turkey to acknowledge that the genocide took place.
Obviously it is difficult, but it would not be the first country to regret a dark episode in its history.
Turkey would then have to act consistently with the objective of true peace-making by re-establishing diplomatic relations with Armenia.
. (FR) There are questions that will not go away; nor will the historic wounds that remain open in the Armenian community throughout the world.
In its resolution in June 1987, the European Parliament asked Turkey to have the courage to look at its past with open eyes in order to be able to look towards the future.
Democracy is guaranteed by historical truth, which cannot be bought or sold and cannot suffer at the hands of special interests, be they financial or economic.
What is at issue today is not recognition of the Armenian genocide's reality, as this House has already had occasion to declare that in 1987.
In asking that the Lamassoure Report should make reference to the genocide, I was not seeking to revive ancestral hatreds or to blow on the embers of intolerance, but to echo the legitimate concerns expressed in Armenian communities.
The children of Armenia who were exiled to our countries at the beginning of the century expect today an act of justice.
They want a 'moral resting-place' for their ancestors.
Remembrance is an even more pressing duty at this time when the last witnesses to the exile, the last to escape the carnage, are themselves quietly dying away.
I am convinced that joining the EU implies adherence to the fundamental principles in accordance with which it was created; democracy, respect for human rights and for the rights of minorities.
Such a step invites each one of the candidate countries to take up the burden of its past in order to be able to make its peace with its own history.
I regret that this House has not followed me in doing this.
. (FR) I abstained on this motion for a resolution.
I regret that the European Parliament has not felt able to show consistency in rejecting the amendments asking Turkey to continue dialogue on acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide.
In fact, last year, Parliament openly committed itself to calling upon the Turkish government to recognise this period of its history.
Today, under a cloak of expediency, this House has demonstrated its hypocrisy.
As regards Turkey's possible accession to the European Union, I would remind you that the real question of the frontiers of Europe is still an open one.
At a distance from the peoples involved, we carry on discussing the hypothetical accession of this country to the EU without putting the real question, which is to do with the identity and outline of Europe.
The Commission and Parliament would be better advised to explore ways by which Turkey can be associated with the EU rather than directly integrated into it.
), in writing. (FR) This report on progress towards accession to the European Union is being presented in a very specific context.
Firstly, Turkey is weighed down by the burden of its foreign debt (over EUR 120 billion) and in consequence has to set aside almost 70% of its budget to service it.
The spiralling debt results in a programme of austerity and structural reform which has brought in its wake massive unemployment and broad cuts in social security expenditure.
As well as economic difficulties, there is a worsening political situation, especially for prisoners of conscience, a persistent denial of the rights of the Kurds, failure to acknowledge the Armenian genocide, and in more general terms a lack of regard for the democratic rights of Turkey' s population.
Despite the fact that the report takes account of the social repercussions of the prolonged economic and financial crisis, pleads in favour of rapid payment of EU financial aid to accompany reforms especially in the social sphere, especially as regards the establishment of the rule of law and the promotion of civil society and even though it considers the - admittedly increased - amount of aid granted to Turkey not yet to reflect the importance attached to Turkey's trade relations with the EU; and insists on the need for Turkey to equip itself with modern legislation on the right to strike and on collective negotiation, it is not for European governments or for the Turkish Government to determine the conditions for membership.
It is for the people of Turkey to decide and they must be consulted by means of a referendum.
It is for these reasons that we did not vote in favour of this report.
Gahrton Report (A5-0366/2001)
. (NL) Given the characteristics of the World Trade Organisation, I wonder how a large and poor country hopes to benefit from it.
I would advise China to stay out of it and to rather rely on self-support than participation in world trade.
But I also agree that China' s accession should not be refused if she asks for it herself.
The People's Republic of China was internationally isolated for many years and was not recognised by most countries.
Since it was ultimately recognised, the territory on the island of Taiwan that is controlled by the successors to the government driven out in 1949 is regarded as a non-recognised state, which is something we should now try to find a solution for.
On the one hand, there are economic and military ties, and on the other, some people act as if she does not exist.
It is just as contrived to automatically allocate Taiwan to China as it was to allocate China's territory to Taiwan in the past.
The two territories have grown far apart over the past 50 years or more, and there have always been ethnic differences anyway.
I reluctantly endorse the proposed structures, but they will not solve the real problems.
Ghent European Council (RC B5-0696/2001)
. (EL) The leaders of the European Union found yet another opportunity at the interim summit in Ghent to side with American imperialism and support their audacious plans in central Asia, which involve bombing and murdering the Afghans.
They clearly stated that they intend to prepare a regime (obviously which meets with their approval) to succeed the Taliban and are willing to help "reconstruct" Afghanistan, thereby revealing their ulterior motive of ensuring that they are involved in sharing out the booty when the time comes.
In addition, they are planning close collaboration with the USA on a whole series of issues, including judicial assistance.
As regards the "enemy within", the summit is planning to speed up anti-democratic legislative arrangements on a common definition of terrorism and a common European arrest warrant at a speed which is revelatory of their intentions.
As for the Middle East, the summit confines itself to a few general pronouncements on a Palestine state and talks of stopping the violence, without making any reference to Israeli aggression.

This is a summit which, just like previous summits, is brimming with anti-grass roots measures and aggressive action against the people; a summit which should give the people of the Member States and of the entire world cause for concern and every reason to step up their fight; a summit which confirms the imperialist nature of the European Union yet again and should be a lesson to all those who proclaim that the ÅU can act as a counterweight to American aggression.
The joint motion contains nothing more than sickening praise for the summit's decisions and shows absolutely no sign of sensitivity to the consequences which these decision will have both within the EU and in the world as a whole, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against it.
. (FR) The European Council in Ghent has just taken note of a Commission report on the preparation for the changeover to euro notes and coins, which presents forty "good practices" suggested to banks, governments and retailers in Member States "in order to make up for lost time".
This parenthetical remark by the Commission must surely pull us up short.
Why has time been wasted, although the date for the changeover of notes and coins has been set for a long time, and governments had all the time in the world to prepare themselves?
The most probable explanation is this: the authorities seem to have thought that private citizens, being in any case caught in the trap, would be obliged to adapt themselves.
Under these circumstances, why should they tire themselves out?
This attitude says much about the thinking behind an operation which was deceitfully presented as being entirely centred on the improved comfort of citizens.
In addition, when you look down the list of the "forty good practices ", you notice that they are minor low-level gimmicks - ranging from the early labelling of prices in euros to longer opening hours at bank counters - whose effect can only be marginal.
But major actions that could conceivably lessen citizens' difficulties, whether financial (reimbursing tradesmen and small businesses for their efforts at adaptation) or technical (stating both the euro value and the value in the national currency on notes and coins), have been firmly excluded.
It is true that dual-denomination notes or coins would have required thought at an earlier stage and for that there would have had to be a real concern to lighten the burden on private individuals.
Nothing, though, could be more foreign to the inventors of the single currency.
Perhaps - as, after all, clouds do have silver linings - citizens will see at the beginning of next year that in fact they had counted for little in the introduction of the single currency.
And then they might learn a few truths about the true nature of Brussels.

Although we welcome some aspects of the resolution that has been adopted today by the European Parliament, we must express our reservations and criticism of some very negative aspects, specifically its support for the war strategy that the USA is implementing in Afghanistan, which will not only fail to resolve any problems but will actually worsen the humanitarian crisis and incidences of racism and xenophobia.
We are also critical of the relentless political pressure to speed up the militarisation of the EU and the communitisation of aspects of 'justice and home affairs' , through the 'creation of a genuine European judicial area.'
What is particularly worrying is the fact that proposals have been tabled for creating a 'European search and arrest warrant' or the controversial and dangerous common definition of terrorist acts as well as measures that represent a serious attack on fundamental freedoms, guarantees and rights linked to the coordination and effectiveness of law enforcement in the framework of cooperation with the USA.
Nor can we fail to mention the symptomatic absence from the resolution of any critical reference to the Ghent Council decisions on confirming compliance with the 'Growth and Stability' pact, with maintaining the policy of wage moderation, or the reform of the labour markets, the processes of liberalising public services - of which the recent decision on postal services is one example - the reform of public services in social provision or the Council' s announcement of the launch of a new round of negotiations at the WTO.
These measures will have a serious effect on the interests of workers and of the communities in the various countries of the EU.
With regard to the creation of a 'preparatory convention' for the new IGC, we feel its prime objective is an attempt to limit or impose conditions on the sovereign decisions of governments and national parliaments.
This is why we have voted against this motion for a resolution.
.
(FR) Like its predecessors, the informal summit in Ghent showed the disagreements that exist between the various Heads of State, which have been the subject of a great deal of comment in the media.
Over and above this apparent discord, though, there has been unanimity on one essential point: the EU is well and truly at war and it is going to back up its commitment to join in combat.
Its repressive arsenal is moving ahead by leaps and bounds:
The Rapid Strike Force will become reality;
A European Judicial Area will allow the creation of one public prosecution authority and harmonise punishments;
The prerogatives of Europol are going to be strengthened.
Without doubt, the most immediate threat to citizens' liberties is the introduction of a European arrest warrant, which, by creating an exceptional law for all the supposed terrorists, will make greater repression possible across the whole of the EU.
The definition of a terrorist has been made broader, and will be able to be applied to all who resist an unjust and intolerable order.
There was clearly no space at this summit for a social Europe; on the contrary, the summit demanded pay restraint and far-reaching reform of the labour market.
In Ghent, social Europe was on the streets - in the demonstrations organised by the young and by the workers.
Therefore, out of support for these events, we will be voting against this resolution on the results of the Ghent Summit.
. (IT) The fundamentalist terrorist attacks have not only destroyed the 'twin towers' in New York but also seem to have played a major part in demystifying two other 'pillars' on the eastern shores of the Atlantic: the common defence policy and the European foreign policy.
The devastating success of this latest attack was helped by the theatrical contribution of certain European governments. Throwing aside years upon years of declarations of intention to define a European foreign policy and good proposals for military integration, they have raised their banners as 'national powers' without even having either any real power by themselves to address the world crisis or the credibility to ensure European security.
The three-sided mini-summit, held an hour before the informal Summit of the Fifteen, was a demonstration of the collapse that has also hit Europe.
The statements on fighting terrorism handed out for signing at the end of the informal Summit are worthless.
We have be accustomed to reading wonderful final declarations for decades now, but these contradict the facts and create genuine bafflement about this 'non-existent Europe' , which unites around statements and then vanishes immediately when it comes to operating and acting in unity to address the crises that threaten world peace.
Given these conditions, I believe the promotion of the European Union as a political entity is the principal task we need to address.
The Ghent 'triumvirate' , which did not even invite the High Representative for European foreign policy, did not have this objective, concerned as they were - and are - with fighting for their leadership or the next elections.
One of them spoke of 'a new leading role in foreign and defence policy for Germany' , forgetting to add - as has been the case for 56 years now, as an attentive leader writer pointed out - 'within Europe' .
Just an oversight as regards 'precedents' , or clear national political will?
This 'triumvirate' would not deserve any critical mention if there were not another triumvirate looming up on the horizon, a really heavyweight one this time, formed by the USA, Russia and the People's Republic of China.
The Ghent triumvirate - 'an affront to Italy and Europe,' as Mr Prodi has said - with a Europe deprived of strength, will be a featherweight in the international ring and, what is more, will weaken the little bit of Europe that exists.
In its place there should, instead, be a new, strong Europe, proud to be so, and seen as essential in maintaining regional balances of power.
The forthcoming European Council in Laeken must cancel out the ambiguities and contradictions found in Ghent.
To achieve this goal, it must issue itself a momentous challenge: to turn words into deeds and initiate 'enhanced cooperation' in the sphere of a political Europe.
This will also benefit economic and financial stability, because it would also correct the anomaly of a European central bank without a European government behind it.
With the current situation in tatters, however, is such a challenge feasible?
I cannot help thinking that the road of integration will lead to greater cohesion of the parties involved.
15 countries acting more cohesively in the area of security and defence - and therefore with a definite foreign policy - will, without doubt, be a much more effective force in the fight against international terrorism and in peacekeeping.
Having said that, and expressing a reservation about the 'convention' method for drawing up the institutional reform project, I vote for the resolution, in the hope that declarations will, at last, be followed up with deeds.
Twenty million Afghans are being hit hard by bombings being carried out for reasons over which they have had no influence.
The UN Commissioner for Human Rights has appealed for a necessary suspension of the bombing in order to get food out to the population before the winter.
Three years of drought have made the supply situation untenable.
I have therefore supported Amendments 2 and 3 in the vote on the resolution concerning the European Council' s informal meeting in Ghent.
A further prerequisite, however, is that the Taliban should allow supplies to reach those who need them.
We also appeal to Pakistan to allow the refugees to be afforded protection.
Poos Report (A5-0308/2001)
Mr President, I voted for the report but, both personally and on behalf of the Pensioners' Party and as a convinced Europeanist, I ask that the Council should have less powers and Parliament have more powers.
We know that the Council is elected by those elected by the citizens, but the European Parliament is elected directly by the citizens.
We are Europe!
Parliament should have the power to legislate, and the Council can have some little legislative duty that affects all the Member States, like defence and foreign policy, but not too much.
I therefore insist that everything possible should be done to give the European Parliament all the power it deserves, as against the Council, whose powers should instead be reduced, since it does not deserve them.
We note that you want to pension the Council off, which is fairly normal in view of your political career.
The reason why 'the role of High Representative for the CFSP and that of the Commissioner responsible for external relations should be merged and assigned to a Commission Vice-President' is that it will be difficult in the long term to maintain the double channels of command that apply to policy in the second pillar.
It is problematic - from the points of view both of clarity and of the budget - for the EU to maintain two external relations administrations for the purpose of implementing foreign policy.
That does not however mean that we in any way support supranationalism within the areas of the second pillar.
We do not therefore want the CFSP to be incorporated into the first, or Community, pillar.
The above position also applies to the relevant passage in paragraph 3 of the report on the progress made in implementing the Common Foreign and Security Policy (A5-332/2001 Rapporteur: Mr Brok).
. (FR) The Poos Report sets out some interesting technical reforms to enable Councils to work better "in a permanent legislative framework" without amending the Treaties.
It is, though, surprising that we do not find there the most obvious reform to make the work of the General Affairs Council easier and reduce the overload on it which is the main problem today: its division into a General Coordination Council (dealing with the general organisation of work, and issues concerning the EU institutions) and a Foreign Affairs Council, which would obviously be of a purely inter-Governmental nature.
This simple and practical reform is not endorsed by the federalists, fearing as they do that it would draw the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy from the new Foreign Affairs Council, whereas they want to bring him into the bosom of the Community by installing him at the Commission, thereby giving it powers in terms of foreign policy.
Their proposal is not realistic.
More broadly speaking, the Poos Report does not seek to anticipate what the Europe of tomorrow will be like and to work out from that how the Council should evolve.
It will be a Europe with many and diverse Member States, so it will have to be a variable-geometry Europe.
For the same reason, it will be a Europe in which the Community method will often be seen as too rigid, and in which there will be a lot of room for the intergovernmental approach, hence a Europe in which the distinction between the "pillars" of the Treaty will have long-term validity.
It will, finally, be a Europe in which the present-day appropriation of power by Brussels will have come to an end - at least let us hope so - and in which national democracies will again make their voices heard.
These broad strokes lead us to design a future central position for the Council, one which should give it a greater initiatory role (although the task of drafting legislation will have to be better shared) and one of coordinating the pillars, the various circles, the national and European levels.
It would now be useful to begin discussing these ideas.
. (FR) The fact that we have voted against Council reform does not imply that we prefer the way it works at present.
It is not the constitutional form of the Council that is important - although much could be said about its anti-democratic character - but its essence.
The basic reason for the Council's existence is to manage the collective affairs of the property-owning classes in the various European countries, so that their respective interests do not conflict and that a general consensus may be established.
The European Council, though, no more represents the interests of the majority of the EU's population than the various governments represent the real interests of their own peoples.
The apparently democratic way in which national governments are appointed after elections does not prevent them being at the service of their countries' big bosses.
All the more is this true of Europe's executive, which is not even obliged to seek election.
We do not guarantee the present or the eventually reformed functioning of the European institutions.
.
(PT) The Poos report on the reform of the Council is controversial and contradictory and, albeit rather timidly, further clears the way for European federalism.
On the one hand, it contains positive aspects on improving transparency, not to mention the concept of change in the institutions in an enlarged European Union, in its references to the workings of the Council and to greater participation by national and regional parliaments in EU policy.
On the other hand, it puts forward some highly controversial ideas, specifically transferring the responsibilities of the High Representative of the CFSP to the Commission, thereby reducing the powers of the Council and further communitising this important policy, which we must, of course, oppose.
At the same time, it puts forward working methods for the Council that could have a damaging effect on the role of national governments, moving towards greater federalism, which include: strengthening the General Affairs Council, so that its meetings are held regularly, weekly even, attended by ministers; and a distinction being made between the legislative and executive Council, which must operate openly, which would seem to be moving towards the creation of some kind of European Union Senate.
Therefore, in voting against this motion, we confirm our opposition to this path to federalism without undermining the report' s positive aspects.
. (FR) Council reform?
Public opinion throughout Europe plainly sees evidence that this is needed, as also evidence of the democratic deficit in European structures.
The absolute requirements of this reform should be the reinforcement of democracy and transparency, the involvement of citizens and control by them.
One should also beware of explaining, as the rapporteur does, that all the dysfunctions result from disregard of the Treaties or even from the loss of power by the Commission and the "General Affairs" Council.
Over and above structural improvements such as the strengthening of Parliament's role, control and monitoring of the Commission and the Council, greater power being given to citizens, whether directly or indirectly - by way of associations, trades unions, etc - there is the need today to discuss the direction of this European project which is dominated by free-market thinking, the very antithesis of democracy and of provision for social needs.
New institutions for another Europe - that is what should be the topic put forward for the peoples of Europe to discuss and vote on.
It is for this reason that we have not voted in favour of the Poos Report.
.
I was delighted to cast my vote in favour of the excellent report by Mr Poos.
As a representative of Scotland and a member of the European Free Alliance section of my Group, I particularly welcome paragraph 13 of the report, calling for the involvement of "national parliaments and, in federal or highly regionalised States, the regional authorities including participation in the Council itself according to Article 203 of the EC Treaty."
For Scotland and similar countries this will only be a start, but it will be an important one.
This Parliament is concerned about the democratic deficit.
To remedy this, let us seek to secure a greater role for devolved parliaments in making European law.
If parliamentarians at all levels in Europe are to be engaged effectively, there must be open and public legislative debate in the Council.
We must highlight the need for publicity and openness in the Council, as stipulated in paragraph 26 of the report.
The reforms urged in this report all go in the right direction.
. (NL) As former Luxembourg minister, Mr Poos knows how the Council works, and he has put this to good use.
He is right to raise the matter of meeting behind closed doors, which is inconsistent with the principles of democracy and openness.
He also proposes that joint committees only prepare resolutions instead of taking them themselves.
He also wants the strange new post of High Representative for the common foreign and security policy, which is developing into a European super-minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, but which cannot be called to account politically in this area, to be integrated into the European Commission's portfolio for external relations.
Mr Poos limits himself to what is feasible within the existing treaties and the current power relations, because this would be able to be achieved quickly.
I support him in this.
However, even if these reforms are implemented, the Council remains an absurdity, a remnant from the early days of the three European Communities, which is backing out of national parliaments and the EP.
National ministers used to act as negotiators on the formation of an interest grouping and were also entitled to exercise their veto rights.
They no longer have this in their current function, in which they act as a senate which cannot be called to account and a government at the same time.
The national parliaments must take over their task.
The continued existence of the Council will have an adverse effect on parliamentary democracy.
World Trade Organisation (RC B5-0691/2001)
. (FR) We have voted against the joint resolution submitted by the European People's Party and Socialist Groups on the forthcoming ministerial conference of the WTO in Qatar in November, as it seems to us that it is yet again trapping us by agreeing to the opening of new international trade negotiations without adequate clarification of what the ground rules are and what objectives are in view.
Commissioner Lamy's speech yesterday leads us to conclude that, even though he is striving to present a wide range of objectives for future negotiations (liberalisation, regulation, the involvement of developing countries, the taking into account of sustainable development), liberalisation is still indeed the primary objective.
Moreover, the WTO's reference documents, which are centred on too strictly commercial a view of trade, inherently tend towards the adoption of this objective.
Matters would be made worse still if the negotiating mandate included investment among the WTO's competencies, as this would risk the revival of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI), of infamous memory.
We would, though, not wish to suggest that liberalisation is in itself bad, as a party of the Left thinks.
We do think, though, that there is now the need for a pause.
Time must be found to draw up a clear balance sheet on the Uruguay Round.
On that basis, negotiations must indeed be opened, but with this primary mandate: to consider how to guarantee to every society, to every national democracy, the right to choose how to live.
Liberalisation will produce all its benefits only if we have first provided a definite answer to this question.
. (EL) The demonstrations in Seattle, Prague and Genoa were an expression of the increasing anxiety at grass-roots level about the consequences of globalisation.
This massive popular reaction shows that even the regulations of the WTO are socially unacceptable.
The demonstrations, which were attended by demonstrators from around the world, were one of the deciding factors in bringing down the talks.
The WTO, the main objective of which is to fully liberalise trade, is basically promoting a process of neo-colonialism and is now one of the mainstays of the new world order.
The rules of the WTO serve to promote the interests of dominant multinational companies which already monopolise certain international markets and are therefore the stuff of nightmares for developing countries and workers as they watch their rights being eroded.
The large countries are promoting the interests of their multinationals, at the expense of the less developed countries, without so much as a word about the long-standing request of these countries to have their debts cancelled.
In the agricultural sector, rapid restructuring is being called for in order to concentrate the land in a few hands and forge another link in the chain controlled by the network of multinationals.
Furthermore, the liberalisation of trade and the abolition of duty and subsidies have hit agricultural production directly, reducing farmers' incomes, decimating farming and increasing unemployment.
Agricultural production in Greece - and elsewhere - is being sacrificed in order to protect and corner a larger share of the international market for processed products from central and northern Europe.
We believe that, rather than defending the interests of the people, the EU will again endeavour at the new round of talks to stake a bigger claim for the European monopolies, in competition with the other imperialist centres, i.e. the USA and Japan.
The rules which govern international economic relations and trade should serve the interests of the workers, leave their fundamental social rights untouched, help to develop less developed countries, respect the environment and respect the rights of all nations to exercise control and decide on their future themselves.
The WTO is, by its very nature, an imperialist structure interested in the maximum possible return on capital and more secure, flexible and unimpeded ways of moving capital, especially from trade and the stock exchange, impoverishing huge swathes of the world's population and contaminating and destroying more and more of the natural environment in the process.
Under this new world order, which uses every possible means to impose the law of the jungle and where might is right, people are beginning to understand that the only solution is resistance and counterattack.
The movement against globalisation and the WTO may be uncoordinated and disparate, but it is the first counterattack on the dictatorship of the monopolies and economies of interest.
It is sending out a message of resistance and counterattack to the millions of workers, unemployed, small and medium-sized farmers and other victims of the capitalist world order which the WTO is trying to impose.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the motion because most of it sides with the major corporations planning to bring about unbridled liberalisation, plunder even more poor countries, wipe out farming and attack the achievements of the workers and the rights of the people throughout the world.
. (FR) I regret that Commissioner Lamy was not more explicit yesterday about the discrepancies between the Council's negotiation mandate and the draft declaration by the Ministers at the Doha conference.
I thought I heard - the Commissioner was speaking sotto voce - that they particularly related to the new reduction in external protection and internal support for our agriculture which certain States had demanded.
I also regret that the joint resolution that Parliament has just voted on commits the sin of incoherence by remaining silent on Community preference, whilst rightly emphasising the right of WTO members to apply agricultural policies adapted to their needs and conditions and especially the right of EU Member States to defend a European model of agriculture founded on family holdings, safe and high-quality food, protection of the environment and a balance between town and country.
Food safety constitutes a strategic dimension, on which the tragic events of 11 September throw a new light.
It is not feasible that the European Union should depend long-term on imports - some 75% of its requirements - of a family of products as important, vital and strategic as oilseed proteins.
How can the European Union condemn itself to zero growth in a crucial sector in which production worldwide is increasing by 5% per annum?
What would happen in the event of weather hazards in the Americas?
It is therefore imperative that the fatal error of Blair House, the absurd and severe self-limitation agreed to in Marrakech be put right in the next round of negotiations.
The complete elimination of animal fats makes it all the more necessary to be able to support the development of Community-wide production of vegetable proteins: this objective must be a priority for the European negotiator.
We will be extremely watchful on this issue.
Désir Report (A5-0331/2001)
I have, of course, voted for this report, Mr President, on democracy in international trade, but I should like to do more.
As the representative of the pensioners that I have had the chance to meet over these two and a half years, I should also like to launch a new slogan here today: 'Pensioners of the world, unite!'
Pensioners are citizens who have more money than young people and would be able to influence the trade and economy of the whole world.
I therefore appeal to all pensioners and all elderly people throughout the world to unite in an organisation that can make its weight felt - a weight they are entitled to have because of their numbers - so they can influence international trade to make it more humane and friendlier to those in need, as we all hope.
. (FR) We voted in favour of the report on "Openness and democracy in international trade" in order to assert our demand for a reform of the World Trade Organisation towards greater transparency and fairness (especially in regard to the settlement of differences) and also the strengthening of control by the peoples.
A double ambiguity, though, exists in this regard, both at European level and at the level of the WTO.
As regards the European Union, successive reforms of the Treaties have practically excluded the national parliaments from control and ratification of the common trade policy.
The Nice Treaty, which is currently in the process of being approved, effectively completes the work while excluding them from negotiations touching on services and intellectual property.
Neither de jure nor de facto does the European Parliament take over, and in any case, even if it did gain a real right of ratification, the end result would still be the overall enfeeblement of democratic control, because of the abolition of any direct power on the part of national democracies, which are closest to the peoples.
From this point of view, the European Parliament's proposal that a consultative parliamentary assembly should be created within the WTO looks like the beginning of work on another level of dispossession.
Such an assembly would in fact risk giving greater legitimacy to the disregard of the opinions of national democracies, and the putting in place thereby of "regulations" the effect of which would be to confine them even more.
There is then a need to assert most clearly that the objective of the consultative assembly is to improve information, but not under any circumstances to replace the national parliaments in any way.
For us, in fact, the first of these "regulations" to retain, is that each and every people, expressing itself directly or through its national parliament, has the right to choose what kind of society it wants to be and what laws shall apply within it.
. (FR) The rapporteur cannot be naïve enough to think that the terrible inequalities in world trade are due to the fact that most member countries of the WTO "are marginalised because of non-inclusive working methods or because they are not, or not effectively, represented in Geneva" or even due "to practices inherited from the GATT" .
Economic relations between countries, and trade relations in particular, obey only one law - the law of the strongest - and certainly do not involve the type of "democracy" that the rapporteur would like to see.
The imperialist countries impose their law on third world countries and the United States impose their own, even on second-ranking imperialist powers.
Clearly, giving the poorest countries a few extra posts within the WTO or in any other international body is not going to change the balance of power.
The report' s real motives are to be found in the fact that international trade, whose laws resemble the law of the jungle, is giving rise to protest and demonstrations.
Although it does not have the power to change the substance of the matter, the European Parliament is invited to put a democratic spin on a type of relationship that is poles apart from a relationship of equality and democracy.
We have not, of course, given our support to this playacting and have voted against the report.
. (FR) On Tuesday, 11 September 2001, airliners full of passengers crashed into two symbols of American omnipotence, in this case the twin towers and the Pentagon.
America was wounded to the core, but an entire vision of civilisation was also attacked.
There is one lesson that we must learn from this appalling act inflicted on the United States, globalisation' s main player and beneficiary in a process which is becoming increasingly inegalitarian. The lesson is that the industrialised countries can no longer afford not to discuss North-South relations.
The outbursts seen in Seattle, Göteborg and Genoa bore the first symptoms of this global divide.
We must now ask searching questions, particularly about the bodies that regulate globalisation.
Mr Désir' s report is enlightening on this matter.
In Seattle, for example, the United States' delegation comprised around 150 people and those of Japan and the European Union around one hundred, whereas most of the developing countries had just one representative.
In such circumstances, it is difficult for the world' s poorest countries to ensure that the voice of their people is heard.
Although the legitimacy of the WTO cannot be questioned, its workings, its transparency and its effectiveness in terms of wealth distribution are debatable to say the least.
I would say that the rapporteur' s proposals intended to respond to this threefold challenge are a step in the right direction, and that is why I have voted in favour of his report.
Nevertheless, our action must not stop there: we must also take direct action on the debts of poor countries, show less arrogance towards our southern partners and more respect for them, and stop trying to impose our form of civilisation on them.
The fourth WTO ministerial conference, due to take place in Doha, in Qatar, in November, is in this sense an opportunity that we must grasp if we are to translate our fine-sounding words into practical action, like pillars supporting a fairer world, in which there is greater solidarity between nations.
. (NL) The existence of a World Trade Organisation could perhaps be useful if it were limited to helping individual states to set up trade contacts with other, remote states.
Unfortunately, the pretensions of the current WTO go much further than that.
It is trying to impose standards on Member States in which the protection of jobs, the environment and public services is subordinated to freedom of trade and the protection of big multinational companies.
The WTO has become a kind of alternative United Nations, but one in which it is not the power of the number of inhabitants but the power of money that counts.
As a result of the imposed globalisation, the gulf between rich countries who export expensive, high-tech products and poor countries who are dependent on exports of cheap raw materials from agriculture and mining is widening.
The profits from investments in these countries flow back to the richest countries.
This WTO is trying to maintain these abuses, and in doing so forms a threat to welfare, the environment and democracy.
Mr Désir is making a creditable attempt to promote openness and democracy in international trade.
I support him in this, but I fear that it will be insufficient without further changes.
Brok report (A5-0332/2001)
Mr President, while I was on the plane taking me from Bratislava to Prague and then on to Malpensa, on my way back from my visit to Slovakia, I was reading the Brok report to decide on how to vote when, as often happens to me, I fell asleep.
I had a dream.
Knowing that Mr Brok is so good at foreign policy, Mr President, I dreamt that he had become Foreign Minister in the Europe of the future.
I also dreamt that on the plane, as well as Mr Brok, there were some beautiful blonde hostesses from the Czech Republic.
I woke up, Mr President. I am sure that the beautiful blondes will remain a dream, but will Mr Brok as Foreign Minister come true?
. (EL) I have to admit that our rapporteur, the German Christian Democrat Elmar Brok, does not mince his words.
Both the motion for a resolution and the explanatory statement are exercises in militaristic, aggressive cynicism about the substance of the CFSP (common foreign and security policy) and the CSDP (common security and defence policy).
He considers that, especially from mid-2001 onwards, the common political will to act at the operational level has been visibly in evidence and cites "crisis management" in the Middle East and the FYROM as examples of successful autonomous intervention on the part of the European Union.
The report then includes a long-winded list of means and institutions currently available to the European Union to carry out its "God-given" job of "conflict prevention" and "crisis management" (crises which the EU will be sure to provoke) throughout the world: the rapid reaction force, the primary objective of which is to create a Euro-army by 2003, initially with 60,000 troops, measures for the rapid flow of resources, non-military - but armed - crisis management (by creating a corps of 5,000 police officers), the (new) Situation Centre and the Policy Planning and Early Warning Unit (both of which come under Mr Solana's department) and so on. Russia, the Ukraine, Moldavia, Africa, Latin America and so on are all seen as military partners outside our area.
The stated aim is to impose policies which serve imperialist interests, to get these countries to accept the rules of the capitalist market and - naturally - to respect human rights, or rather what the ÅU understands by human rights.
Furthermore, "global responsibility for peace, stability and sustainable development" is used to justify the need, highlighted in the report, for the EU to develop its strategic plans in Iran, China, Korea and Indonesia.
In other words, the Brok report cynically illustrates the imperialist nature of the ÅU which - necessity being the mother of invention - wants to promote its interests in glorious collaboration with the USA, using NATO resources.
The report is crystal clear on the division of roles between the two imperialist powers, viz. the USA and the ÅU, which will act in concert with the USA, where possible, or on its own if the USA is not willing or prepared to act.
This position marries perfectly with its wholehearted support for the USA in the new imperialist war in Afghanistan and Eurasia in general, fronted by the coalition against international terrorism which has come along, like manna from heaven now that the USSR and the Warsaw Pact have broken up, to give the imperialists an alibi, a modern day "red under the bed" to justify intense arming, curtailing the rights of our people, fortifying their system every which way and any type of intervention - military or otherwise - anywhere in the world.
Mr Brok's statement during his presentation to plenary captures the tone of the report perfectly. He said that, if we want to be convincing and reliable in our foreign policy, we need to demonstrate on a daily basis that we are prepared to use military means to enforce what is not accepted using other means.
Who today can dispute the Marxist tenet that war is in the nature of capitalism and, even more so, in the nature of imperialism?
That is why the people cannot afford to rest on their laurels.
The peace movement at national, European and global level against the warmongering imperialists is the only prospect of survival for mankind.
. (NL) The existence and maintenance of an army is always justified by the argument that it was necessary in order to defend the freedom of the country's own territory and to discourage potential occupying forces.
Because nobody likes to be occupied, the existence of such an army is accepted by a majority of people, albeit often with doubt or reluctance.
Action by armies outside their own borders, on the other hand, is always rightly regarded as a form of aggression and imperialism.
In recent years, there has been an offensive to justify the action of armies outside their own territory.
This happened in Iraq and in Kosovo, and it is now happening in Afghanistan.
When Mr Solana took up office, I heard him say that he knows of many places outside the territory of the EU where an army could be deployed.
Mr Brok wants a decision on the operational readiness of a European 'Rapid Reaction Force' to be reached soon.
I reject this part of his proposals, although I do share his views on the struggle against money laundering and against the international drugs trade, finding a humanitarian and political solution for Chechnya, strengthening the peace-building capacity of the United Nations and making aid for Macedonia dependent on the implementation of the agreed amendment to the constitution.
. (FR) One cannot fail to be struck by the huge disparity between Mr Brok' s report and the new course taken by international relations since 11 September.
The rapporteur does, admittedly, mention that date but fails to draw any conclusions from it with regard to taking the CFSP in a new direction.
Instead, he clings to the reassuring dogmas of the old school of thought, organised around the concept of 'everything for the Community' : the High Representative of the CFSP must be communitised, decisions on joint action must be reached by a majority, and so forth.
The new international landscape that is emerging as a result of the ongoing fight against terrorism forces us to act on two levels: the national level, the sovereign prerogatives of which will prove crucial in this new type of war, and the world level, which is the only level appropriate for the large-scale cooperation that is necessary.
The European level is only an intermediate phase, all too often too limited to lay hold of the global circuits and networks of international terrorism.
In times of tension, decisive cooperation tends to take place directly between States.
This was the case with the significant military contribution that the United Kingdom made to the United States' action, the tripartite Ghent Summit, and the bilateral cooperation between France and Germany.
The CFSP will have to adapt rapidly to the new diplomatic climate.
The focus for the necessary coordination between the various pillars, as well as between the intergovernmental approach and the Community aspects, must be the Council, which is the only institution capable of playing a pivotal role.
The same requirement for effectiveness must lead to the creation of a specific 'Foreign Affairs' Council, separate from the Council.
This is a point that Commissioner Barnier made in his speech.
Unless these changes are made, the CFSP is in danger of being rapidly marginalised and relegated to role of merely issuing declarations.
.
British Conservatives strongly support European cooperation in foreign policy and the use of EU civil instruments in conflict prevention, where shared interests exist.
However, they insist that national governments must retain absolute sovereignty over foreign and defence policy.
We do not, therefore, support movement towards establishment of an EU diplomatic service or the "communitarisation" of foreign policy; the extension of Europol competence into operational areas; or measures that will lead to the development of a European Army.
We believe that NATO should be the international organisation of first resort, not just for collective defence, but for all relevant crisis management tasks requiring the use of military assets.
COM in sheepmeat and goatmeat
The next item is the report (A5-0340/2001) by Mr Adam, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat [COM(2001) 247 - C5-0214/2001 - 2001/0103(CNS)].
Mr President, the present organisation is manifestly unsatisfactory to all the parties involved, particularly the sheep and goat farmers, but also to Member States and the Commission.
It has allowed the income of sheep farmers to fall behind the general levels of income of other sections of the farming community.
This widening gap is a serious matter when considering that large areas of the Community are highly dependent on sheep and goat farming.
The method of calculation of the premium is complicated and statistically suspect.
The figures on which the eventual sheep premium is agreed cannot be justified in a satisfactory manner because it requires detailed information of what is happening in the market and that cannot readily be obtained nor easily substantiated.
Another drawback is that the premium is based on deficiency payments.
This is not acceptable to the WTO and is therefore a barrier to negotiations in agricultural issues generally.
For farmers there is uncertainty over a 12-month period as to what annual premium will be paid eventually.
Because of this uncertainty the premium does not allow effective management planning.
All these drawbacks were recognised by the Commission and are largely reinforced by a study that was carried out prior to the preparation of the proposals which we are now debating.
The Commission proposal, in essence, is simpler, less bureaucratic and will be easier to understand.
The fundamental difference is that it is based on a fixed annual payment.
This is less objectionable to the WTO and therefore will help with the overall agricultural negotiations in which the Commission is involved.
More importantly, from the farmers' viewpoint, the premium will be known in advance and this will make farm business decisions easier.
My discussions in contact with the sheep and goat farmers of the Community confirm that the proposals are broadly acceptable to them.
The information that I have from Member States is that it is broadly acceptable to them as well.
There is agreement that it is desirable to agree the revision in time for 1 January 2002 so that the benefit to the farming community can come in as quickly as possible.
The principle of the Commission's proposals is broadly acceptable to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, though there are differences in emphasis.
The committee proposes a premium 50% higher than that put forward by the Commission.
The lower premium for milking-sheep and goats is rejected and a higher supplement proposed for sheep and goats in less favoured areas.
There are strong pressures within the committee that the market organisation should make greater provision for national differences.
A number of proposals have been put forward.
They cover such matters as extensification, de-stocking and the buy-out of premium rights.
There are also proposals which would allow Member States to make additional headage and area payments.
These would be based on objective criteria which could cover, inter alia, environmental considerations, tagging and traceability.
Sheep farming has not made the productivity advances seen in other agricultural sectors.
Amendments have been introduced calling for Commission support for increased marketing promotion.
Targeting young people to encourage consumption will be important for success.
The committee recognises that this is an interim stage and looks forward to reports from the Commission on environmental impact, traceability and pasturing techniques.
It is anticipated that this will lead to wider reforms in the Agenda 2000 mid-term review.
The Agriculture Committee looks to the Commission for a positive response to the amendments it has proposed.
Mr President, my report on behalf of the Committee on Budgets is brief, because the Committee on Budgets was asked to give its opinion on the proposal by the Commission.
We were broadly supportive.
First of all, it streamlines the policy, making it simpler and much more defensible within the GATT negotiations, thereby providing longer-term security for farmers engaged in sheep and goat farming.
We proposed an amendment in relation to individual tagging.
We did not propose in that way to enter into the area of food safety, or indeed the business of the Committee on Agriculture.
We simply wanted to ensure that premiums were paid on sheep and goats that actually existed and that we had a means of ensuring that the animals could be counted and accounted for.
Since I am responsible to the Committee on Budgetary Control for animal products, I felt it my duty to insert that amendment.
Speaking for myself, I can say that the Committee on Budgets has its responsibilities.
This is largely a neutral proposal by the Commission, but the Committee on Agriculture has its responsibilities to farmers.
I support the position it has taken in this respect.
I support the Doyle amendment which was passed by the Committee on Agriculture.
As regards costs, the Committee on Budgets added approximately EUR 400 million in horizontal cuts that the Council deducted from the budget so we added EUR 400 million this morning.
We added another EUR 400 million in relation to animal health measures.
The budget this year is 2% more in real terms than we started with last year, and in real terms it is more than 5%, when you consider the outturn.
It is my opinion, and the opinion of EPP members in the Committee on Budgets, that there are sufficient funds to meet the request of the Committee on Agriculture: if the Doyle position is accepted by this Parliament and by the Council there are sufficient resources to finance the policy.
It will be a shift of money from the rich areas to the poor areas, from the bigger farmers to the smaller farmers.
It is a social and regional measure that we could do with.
Mr President, I reiterate what my colleague, Mr McCartin, has just said.
He is speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgets.
There is money there to support the proposals that were passed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for a EUR 30 fixed rate premium and a EUR 9 supplement premium.
There is money there.
I appeal to colleagues to support the views of the Agriculture Committee.
I fear tonight's vote - on a Thursday night - may be unrepresentative of the large majority decision at the Agriculture Committee on this particular issue.
The Community average income of sheep and goat producers is generally amongst the lowest of all sectors, especially in northern Europe where lambs are reared in meat production systems.
I quote the words of the Commission: "Unlike beef and other commodities, the Community is deficient in sheepmeat and, under the present regimes, there is a major exodus from sheep production, especially in northern Europe.
The beef regime unwittingly also supports this exodus from sheep production as ewes are counted for extensification payment under this regime but are not paid for, thereby encouraging farmers who have the option to decrease their sheep and increase their cattle on a holding to draw down more extensification payments."
The most cost-effective solution from a common agricultural policy point of view is to ensure that the sheep and goat regimes, together with the impact of the beef regime, encourage as much land as possible to be kept in Europe in sheep production.
It is at least four times as expensive to support a livestock unit of beef, compared to that of sheepmeat.
While beef producers need all the support they are getting, given their present difficulties, it is not in their interest either to have competition generated between dry stock sectors by imbalance in the respective regimes.
The main proposal for a fixed, single annual premium I fully support, at EUR 30.
I fully support it, in place of the unfair, uncertain and - from a WTO perspective - unacceptable present deficiency payment system.
We support the flexibility amendments to send a message to the Commission that there is room for different treatment in some Member States in relation to this regime, providing that it does not come from the flat rate payment.
We cannot support the identification and traceability amendments because this is a matter for DG V, not because we do not support the principle but because it is for another DG, and for that reason solely.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, first of all, to welcome the work of Mr Adam, our rapporteur, and to congratulate him on his desire to give some hope to sheep and goat farmers, who are, by and large, at the lower end of the scale of agricultural earnings.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has used its vote, as you quite rightly pointed out, to confirm the principle of a basic deficiency payment, of a rural premium and of a supplementary flexibility premium based on the criteria of produce quality, the environment or financial management.
It is also the case that the levels set by our committee will have to be readjusted in plenary if Parliament hopes to influence Council and, therefore, maintain credibility.
The Commission recommended a maximum of EUR 28 per head but the Committee on Agriculture raised the amount to EUR 44, which far exceeds the expectations of rearers and could, furthermore, prove difficult to reconcile with the room for manoeuvre provided by the budget.
On behalf of my group, I have, therefore, retabled two of the rapporteur' s amendments designed respectively to reset the basic premium at EUR 25 per head and the premium for milk herds - ewes or she-goats - at EUR 20.
In the 'meat' sector, the maximum aid per head would therefore, be EUR 39, which would ensure equal treatment in terms of public premiums per hectare for sheep breeders and milk-cow breeders.
I would say that this is a totally logical approach, because these two types of production often exist side by side in the same regions and areas and even within the same holdings.
In terms of the markets, we now have two situations at variance with one another: a surplus of beef and veal and a deficit of sheepmeat.
If per-hectare premiums are set at an equivalent level, this could restore the balance of production, with the choices made by producers being influenced by market conditions.
Furthermore, I recommend maintaining a difference between the basic premium for the 'meat' sector and the premium for the milk sector because to do otherwise would leave the sheep and goat milk sectors with no future, which nobody wants to see.
This is why I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that this evening you will support these amendments, which I think are both realistic and responsible.
Mr President, on behalf of the liberal group, I can say that we broadly support the Commission's proposals.
We find the new system better than the old system, which was more or less a system of deficiency payments.
We also find the amounts specified by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development excessive.
We will therefore support Mr Garot's and Mr Adam's amendments, which are slightly more modest but which do in fact provide a good negotiating position in respect of the Council.
My group has submitted new amendments which relate to the identification of the animals.
We consider it to be of the utmost importance that when money is being distributed - animal premiums and suchlike - the control system is spick and span and there is very little wrong with it.
The Commission should therefore introduce a new identification system as soon as possible.
Finally, and I am saying this on behalf of the group, I have tabled amendments stating that dikes and salt marshes in Europe will also be regarded as least favoured areas.
I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very hard work on this difficult report.
Farming has taken a blow over the past year in the United Kingdom, and sheep farming, of course, is no exception.
Given the fact that 80% of my own nation - Wales - is designated by the EU as less favoured and that sheep farming is the only available method of farming in many part of Wales, this report has far-reaching implications for Wales and its hill and upland farmers, as indeed it has for their European counterparts.
I therefore welcome additional financial support for farmers situated in less-favoured areas such as Wales and I urge fellow MEPs to support additional payments for these areas.
Now although this premium will not solve overnight the immediate crisis, we need to get the proposal through as quickly as possible to ensure that the sheep annual premium payments will be in place by January 2002.
The original proposal was disappointing, and a lot of hard work has been put in to get the best deal possible for farmers in this regard.
Of course, I want to see farmers get the fairest and highest possible premium.
However, we have to work within the budget, and this is why I fully support Mr Adam's proposal of EUR 25 and am confident that the Council will consider this proposal as a very viable option given the constraints.
Pitching the figure higher than this would lose money to other sectors including rural development.
I will be voting against Amendment No 21, as I believe the wording to be too vague, and I would like to see a clause stating that any money put back into the national reserve from a region or country within a Member State should be ring-fenced to ensure the benefit of this fund is maintained for that particular area - that is a very important point.
We must protect our sheep-farming industry because to lose more farmers from the industry would have a catastrophic effect on the make-up of rural communities where small family farms play such a vital role.
Seldom have I seen a greater degree of unanimity on the need for reform of the sheep and goat sector.
The rapporteur, the Commission, Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and farming organisations are all at one on the need for reform.
It is now down to this Parliament and the Council to give meaningful effect to this consensus.
There is, however, one important bridge to be crossed if this desired objective is to be achieved.
Unless we succeed in reaching a fair consensus on the level of financial support for sheep farming, this attempt at reform will fail and the decline of sheep production will lead to a significant imbalance in the European meat sector, thereby putting greater pressure on the beef sector as farmers switch from one enterprise to another.
So, it makes good economic sense to get the balance right now.
There will not be another bite at this cherry.
We talk a lot about the sustainability of European agriculture.
To me it means maintaining a reasonable balance between all sectors, including the profitability of each.
I do not have to remind the House of the relevance of sheep farming in areas not suited to other agricultural enterprises and the importance, from a rural development perspective, of sustaining farm families in those areas.
I do, however, wish to acknowledge the positive aspects of the Commission proposals, including the findings of the Evaluation Committee report, the simplification of procedures and the introduction of a single premium.
Here, however, I differ with the Commission on its method of calculation, based on averaging.
This does not fairly reflect the difficulties experienced by the sector over a longer period.
During the debate, I tabled a number of amendments.
My proposal for a flat rate premium of EUR 32 was not supported; it was based on a fair and thorough evaluation by agricultural economists of the level of support necessary to restore equity to the sector.
On behalf of my Group, I then supported proposals for EUR 30 - a figure which I believe is the very minimum necessary to close the gap and help restore profitability to the sector.
I ask the House not to deviate from this figure, which can be accommodated within the existing guidelines, and also to support amendments on compensation for extensification, the rural world premium and funding for market developments.
Like all Members of this House, I am conscious of the budgetary implications of reform.
I caution against reform of sheepmeat at the expense of other sectors, particularly beef.
Those who take pleasure in pointing out that agriculture takes up almost 50% of the budget should keep in mind that this general support is as much a subsidy to consumers as it is support for the farming community - the people who are expected to guarantee food supply and quality and at the same time maintain the rural environment.
Those who believe that agriculture is oversubsidised should take note of the continuing decline in the number of farm families and ask themselves why this is happening.
We should note, in my view, with alarm the reluctance of young people to take up farming and ponder the consequences for food security and employment in the agricultural food sector.
In evaluating the relevance of agriculture to the European and world economy, you cannot apply the same economic criteria as we apply to other sectors.
Mr President, I apologise for my absence.
The report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is an improvement on the Commission proposals but, for all that, it does not make any significant changes in the sheep and goat farming sector.
For example, we agree that it is good idea to increase premiums and special aid, which have not risen since 1993 and have since been eroded by inflation.
We also agree that it is a good idea to make the conditions for payment of supplementary aid more flexible.
However, we do not agree that it is a good idea to maintain the difference between mixed meat and milk production subsidies, which the report justifies on the grounds that mixed production unit holders generate additional income from milk production.
This is not comparing like with like because meat production units, which are mainly located in northern countries, are large operations which afford a satisfactory income and profit to their owners, while mixed production units, which are mainly located in the Mediterranean countries, are family-run holdings in the most barren areas which do not afford their owners a viable income, with the result that they are declining year on year and these areas are being abandoned.
The headage payments in Greece for each holding have not risen since 1989-1991.
The report accepts the philosophy of quotas and even tries to add to it with management quotas, despite the fact that the European Union's self-sufficiency in sheep- and goatmeat is around 80%, sheep and goat farms are to be found in the poorest areas of the European Union, where no alternative form of farming is generally possible, and sheep and goat farmers are the poorest social group in the European Union.
If we really wanted to provide income support for these regions and for sheep and goat farmers, we would abolish quotas, increase subsidies and provide other additional incentives.
This sort of policy would help to reverse the rate of abandonment of mountain and mainly barren areas and, at the same time, make the European Union self-sufficient in sheep- and goatmeat.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis besetting livestock farming in Europe is of an unprecedented scale.
If it is not checked it will have terrible consequences for our economies, our societies and for life in our territories.
In the beef and veal sector, despite the mollifying proposals that Commissioner Fischler has put to us - he would have us believe that the crisis is now behind us - we are still in a slump.
In my own country, for example, producers can no longer find takers for their animals even at tragically low prices, which no longer cover production costs.
Despair is gaining ground.
Every day, livestock breeders are being forced out of business in the most tragic way.
Waiting patiently for our remaining producers to go out of business would be a suicidal policy.
I repeat, there is a considerable deficit in the European Union' s sheepmeat sector and looking at the average age of livestock breeders, which is increasing, it is not hard to predict that this deficit will increase in coming years.
Sheep-farmers' incomes are amongst the lowest in agriculture, as the Commission itself acknowledges.
In the current economic climate, we also see many producers in desperate situations and who are forced to stop farming because their income is insufficient.
Apart from the human and social tragedy that this represents, it is also an ecological tragedy because sheep breeding and goat breeding are often the last defence against desertification in regions where farming is difficult.
This is why your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development felt that it was crucial to make some slight improvements to the Commission' s proposal for a regulation, in order to simplify, to be able to forecast and to increase aid to a sector that is suffering harshly, whose economic, social and ecological impact is so important and which gives cattle farmers the opportunity to convert, if it is increased sufficiently.
The very coherent proposals that have been presented attempt to bring the system of aid for the sheepmeat sector into line with aid for milk-cows, whilst complying with budgetary constraints, because the COM in the sheepmeat sector is relatively cheap due to the number of customers for each producer.
These proposals also comply with our international commitments, since the proposed reform aims to separate aid and an income insurance system, which could act as a safety net.
The sheepmeat sector today needs to be stabilised and supported, otherwise it will disappear from many regions.
It requires a reform which is both generous and responsible, and this is what Parliament' s Committee on Agriculture has proposed.
I hope that the House will support us and that the Council will listen.
Mr President, the Commission proposal to create a single annual premium is to be welcomed because it will simplify farmer' s incomes and provide stability.
Nevertheless, it contains various loopholes and shortcomings.
The first is the unsatisfactory level of the proposed premium of EUR 21, which continues to reflect the discrimination against the small ruminants sector in favour of large ruminants.
The proposal of EUR 30 that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development approved will, therefore, resolve this discrimination.
Nevertheless, if this proposal does not have the support of the majority of this House, I will, of course, support any other level that contributes to this objective.
The second shortcoming lies in the continuing discrimination between sheep bred for meat on the one hand and ewes and she-goats on the other, with the latter receiving only 80% of the premium given to meat sheep.
The proposals approved by the Committee on Agriculture will also remedy this unfairness, by making all premiums the same.
The third shortcoming concerns the non-inclusion of flexibility mechanisms that would enable the Member States to make adjustments to national and regional situations.
In this sense, the Committee on Agriculture' s amendments, which are intended to create an additional premium in certain situations, will be of enormous benefit to the implementation of the COM and will make the scheme more realistic and more feasible.
As the Commission itself acknowledges in the explanatory statement, sheep and goat breeders have the lowest incomes of all meat producers with the additional disadvantage that 80% of the animals eligible for premiums are located in parts of the European Union that are both remote and poor.
For this reason, and also because there is a deficit in this sector, which can only meet 80% of domestic consumption, it is becoming very important to make the changes I have just outlined and to increase the supplementary premium for Objective 1 regions.
I therefore hope, that the House approves the Commission proposal and that when the Ministers for Agriculture meet in Council, they do their job properly, and accept the positions of this House.
Lastly, I wish to pay tribute to Mr Adam, who has been an excellent rapporteur, who has put in a great deal of hard work and whom I thank for his generous support.
Mr President, in addition to congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Adam, on his magnificent report, I would like to tell the Commission that some of the terminology in their proposal needs to be amended in order to take account of gender differences.
That is to say, that it constantly forgets that there are female producers and stockbreeders.
I would ask the Commissioner to make these terminological amendments to this proposal and, Commissioner, you can also do this for all of your other proposals, and please inform your staff that this must be done.
Behind this seemingly formal request is my firm determination that, from now on, we recognise female farmers for the important role they play.
Secondly, Commissioner, your proposal contains a renationalisation, which is the cause of a great deal of suspicion, because, to a certain extent, it sets a precedent in this field.
To avoid these suspicions escalating into protests, you should compensate for this shortcoming in your proposal by increasing premiums.
We ask for this unanimously; I hope that Parliament' s proposals will not fall on deaf ears.
Lastly, I have to say that we all recognise that this 'safety net' initiative to compensate the fall in income suffered by farmers and producers of both sexes in times of crisis is a great success.
Mr President, Commissioner, I also wish to thank the rapporteur on his work for a new organisation of the market.
There are two basic factors here supporting all those speeches which express the desire to raise the status and underline the importance of these professions.
The first one is that this is especially important for the regions - absolutely vital for large regions. The other is that we can produce a lot more - as we have heard here - because there is underproduction in this area.
For that reason, all attempts to help and revive these products and this production trend, and highlight their importance, is work done for the common good - the cheapest and most economical of regional policies - and this is an area where agricultural sector has quite obvious shortcomings.
Here, if anywhere, a certain sort of Robin Hood policy will be especially good and useful.
I hope that when it comes to the vote, those of the opinion that we should start to move these matters forward, through greater investment, will win.
Mr President, the Commission proposal dwells on the strategy of separating production aid and prices with the argument that this will simplify the current Organisation of the Market.
The problem is that the level of the per head premium is clearly low, given that the basic price base has not increased since 1993.
Furthermore, although the current system does need to be simplified, we must also take account, as the rapporteur stated, of the fact that sheep and goat breeding is of particular importance to the Community' s least-favoured areas, in which they are concentrated.
The prime objective of any reform of this COM must, therefore, be to improve the income of sheep and goat farmers.
Furthermore, we must consider the fact that, in recent years, the relative position of sheep and goat farmers has seen a decline.
We therefore welcome the per head aid increases to EUR 30 and the additional aid of EUR 9 for the least-favoured regions, because this is a sector whose production is concentrated in poor areas, in which the viability of farms is more precarious, despite the fact that they play a major role in preserving the rural fabric of these regions and, in certain cases, are even the only economically possible activity.
Also to be welcomed is the removal of the distinction between sheep bred to produce milk and those bred for their meat and that the same increase is to be applied to goats.
I am also happy to support the new aid of EUR 5, given the difficulties that this sector is experiencing, although we must bear in mind the danger of renationalisation that the creation of national packages entails.
I hope, therefore, that the House - and especially the Commission - will respond positively to this report and that some of the main demands of sheep and goat farmers will be met.
Mr President, there is unanimity in the House about the importance of this reform, about how simplification is a good thing and how vitally important the sheep industry is.
In all those things Mr Adam has done a good job.
But I have to take issue with him in one contentious area which is: what is to be the level of support for sheep farmers?
I am deeply disappointed that the socialists, the liberals and the nationalists are telling the House that they all intend to vote to cut the recommendation of the Committee on Agriculture by EUR 5 at least in relation to each animal.
They put that forward on the basis of the budget, but in the part of the UK that I represent, Wales - just like Mr Wyn who is sadly no longer in his place - we have seen a huge amount of stock slaughtered because of the foot-and-mouth epidemic.
We see a crippled industry.
We see a situation in which there is no confidence at all in the farming industry today and, as has rightly been said, if you look to an area like Wales, it is no good talking about diversification.
It is no good talking about putting money into Community schemes and improving public transport in rural areas.
We must ensure greater financial support for sheep farmers who have no economic alternative.
Today there are sheep farmers in my constituency who are raising questions about whether they should even restock after foot-and-mouth.
I say to Mr Adam this his government is not helping them by indicating that the compensation scheme that was previously in place is one that they do not intend to continue with, whilst, at the same time, not saying what they intend to put in its place.
That adds to the existing desperation in the countryside.
So, yet again, we hear warm words about the industry, but farmers want deeds, and this means supporting the recommendation made by the agricultural industry for the maximum amount of support for our hard-pressed sheep farmers.
Mr President, the Commission proposal is satisfactory because it clearly attempts to simplify matters by replacing the variable premium with a single premium, meaning that the sector will now know in advance the amount it is to receive and will no longer have to suffer from the uncertainty it has had to endure up until now.
We naturally support the idea that the premium should guarantee an income that is acceptable to the producer and my personal opinion is that this income should be the same for producers of both heavy and light lambs, as approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
The market in sheep' s milk is not regulated in the same way as the market in cow' s milk and income from milk is balanced by a lower level of income from meat production, especially in Mediterranean countries where mixed farms that produce wool, milk and meat slaughter these animals at lower weights, once again, largely in accordance with eating habits.
With regard to the supplementary premium that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposed and approved, I have to say that the Commission should be very vigilant that this supplementary premium should in no case be used to reduce the linear premium, the headage premium or the premium for rural development.
The Commission should understand that Parliament' s Committee wants to see an increase in the premium, comprised of three parts: a headage premium, a premium for rural development and a supplementary premium, in order to be able to help States implement the principle of flexibility.
However, I would strongly urge that this introduction is not, at the end of the day, used to achieve a reduction in the headage premium or in the premium for rural development.
Finally, I would like to say, and the Commissioner is well aware of this, that this sector makes an important contribution to land-use planning and to all the environmental services that we say we are going to defend in this new future common agricultural policy.
However, I think that that truly guaranteeing an income in both this COM and this sector that could pay for the non-food services that this type of livestock farming provides throughout the Community would send an important political signal.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate the Commission on the proposal it has put forward, mainly because it will simplify the COM and will give security and stability to the sector, and also the rapporteur, because he has been able to reconcile the various political sensitivities in this House, sparing no effort to achieve this.
I would ask the Commission to listen to the political message from this Parliament, which is asking for an increase in the premium. This premium is much needed, because it has remained unaltered since 1994; in fact, it has stagnated.
This is the reason why this is one of the sectors that receives the least aid and is the most discriminated against within the COM at the present time.
I think that the proposal from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is reasonable.
However, we will not give our support to amendments put forward a posteriori, because we think that some, such as those put forward by Mr Mulder, should be dealt with in another context, although, it must be said, we are not against what he is saying.
Others run counter to what has already been discussed and on which consensus has been reached in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and would, consequently, blur the political message of this Parliament.
I would ask the Commission, in its debate with Council, to make the necessary effort to give the sector what it needs.
Given that it has already made such an effort when putting forward the proposal, by simplifying the premiums, on the subject of the single premium, and on the possibilities of the Member States managing these premiums, it should make a reasonable budgetary effort - which the Committee on Budgets is not against - so that the objective the sector considers necessary can be achieved.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to expressly welcome the Commission' s proposal for reforming the market organisation for sheep and goat meat.
The previous speakers have already given all the reasons why we so much welcome this proposal.
I would also like to thank our rapporteur most sincerely for his work.
I believe the revision of the premiums is one of the most important points.
The introduction of a fixed rate premium is a major step forward.
But I would like to stress that the figure proposed by the Commission is much too small.
This premium must also be an incentive for sheep and goat farmers and that means EUR 30 and no less.
The premium must also be the same for farmers regardless of whether they produce ewes or milking ewes.
A distinction between the two cannot really be justified.
I also believe that the EUR 9 supplementary premium for ewes and she-goats is particularly justified under the more difficult conditions in the less-favoured areas.
Beef and veal and sheep meat prices generally follow the same trends, which means there is no justification for treating the two sectors differently as regards the premium.
On the contrary, there is a deficit in sheep meat in Austria and in many other countries of Europe.
If we fail to create reasonable conditions and security for this sector, we shall drive sheep and goat farmers into other areas, such as beef and veal, or they will go out of production altogether.
Such a policy would be ill-advised.
Finally, I would like to say that sheep and goat farming should not be supported only in areas that have no alternative, but also in those where sheep and goat farming is traditional.
I therefore hope, Mr President, that the Commission and Council will follow these sensible proposals from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Mr President, first of all I would like to welcome the proposal.
It is perhaps long overdue, but certainly welcome.
I also take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report on this very important subject.
Sheep production is important especially in hill areas, not only because of the environment there and the role it plays in keeping the social fabric of society together, but because it has proven through the centuries to be one of the most important aspects of production in the agricultural sector.
In the United Kingdom because of foot-and-mouth, sheep farmers have suffered greatly.
I recognise that in Northern Ireland we have had a distinct advantage over our colleagues in the mainland UK, including the prices we have been receiving recently.
Our producers have been very lucky.
Over recent years, farmers have been getting less for their sheep than they were 15 years ago and they are receiving less support.
Is it any wonder that young farmers and sheep farmers are actually leaving the industry?
We have to ask ourselves how best we can support them.
I want to make it very clear: I will support the EUR 30 in the amendment in the vote in this House this afternoon.
I hope all of you will be here to vote in favour of this amendment because we must give the political leadership this requires.
For far too long, the sheep sector has been the poor relation.
It has been the poor relation with respect to the milk, beef, tobacco and wine sectors.
It has been the poor relation because it has been deemed to lack a strong voice in Europe.
I would like to congratulate the Commission in coming forward with this proposal because it will be fairer than the present system.
Yes, there will be some budgetary problems but we can get over them.
I ask this House for its support.
Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by sincerely thanking you, Mr Adam, for producing the report and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their contributions to the discussions in committee and also for today' s debate.
I am also very grateful because it is important that we press ahead with this proposal quickly and take a vote on it soon so that it can then hopefully be adopted by the Council as quickly as possible and this reformed market organisation for sheep and goat meat can come into force on 1 January next year and the premiums can then also be paid under this new regime next year.
As many of you have also emphasised, the most important point of the proposed reform is the replacement of the variable deficiency payments by a fixed-rate form of aid.
That has a number of important advantages.
This new aid is stable.
It can also be calculated in advance.
This means that farmers can also plan with certainty.
Above all, it is also a lot less bureaucratic because none of the expensive market intelligence on which the deficiency payments are currently based and all the complex calculations involved will any longer be necessary.
Moreover, it is also of course much, much easier for sheep and goat farmers to understand.
It allows producers to respond correctly to the needs of the respective markets because the support is not affected by changing prices.
The Commission proposal also guarantees budget stability and in particular is also more consistent with WTO objectives over all.
I believe there is broad agreement about these principles, as the debate has shown.
Let me turn briefly to the most important amendments.
Some are concerned with improving the text and are extremely welcome.
I would, for example, be very pleased to accept Amendment No 11 because a more precise definition of the terms "producer" and "holding" will help to make the regulation much easier to understand.
I can also support Amendment No 16, which proposes that premiums be paid not later than 31 March instead of 30 June.
That will mean that producers will get their premiums even earlier.
I also welcome the proposal to change the definition of producer in less-favoured areas, but I think the term could be simplified even more here.
The wording of the amendment therefore needs to be made even more precise in this respect.
On the other hand, I do not think it is necessary, as proposed in Amendment No 44, to specify the supplementary premium for dykes and salt marshes.
They ought to be covered by the rule for less-favoured areas.
So I do not really think this amendment is necessary.
I also consider Amendments Nos 1, 6, 9, 22, 36 and 37 superfluous or pointless in the context of the regulation.
Other amendments are concerned with the need for a degree of flexibility that would enable Member States to provide additional support for the sector or, more especially, to manage the various Member States' individual quotas better and more actively.
The questions that were raised in the discussions in this connection are concerned with a number of aspects and possibilities, ranging from extensification and environmental concerns to the development of quality products, improvement of marketing structures and the creation of producer groups.
I would like to say to you in this connection that while I cannot accept the proposed amendments directly, I do understand very clearly the message they are intended to convey.
I would therefore like to pursue further the concern that lies behind them in order to find solutions that will take better account of the different requirements of the sector in the individual Member States.
But they must be simple solutions.
I do not think we should be creating a new bureaucracy.
The same also applies for Amendments Nos 25 to 30 concerning the national financial frameworks, which should also be placed in the context of the proposals for greater flexibility.
We must ensure that these framework provisions are also practicable and consistent with the objectives stated in the amendments in question.
Amendments Nos 12, 13 and 15 are in fact the ones with the greatest direct effects.
They are concerned with the question, discussed here, of increasing the premium to EUR 30 for all producers and increasing the supplementary premium for producers in less-favoured regions to EUR 9.
If these proposals were accepted, expenditure would rise to EUR 2.7 billion.
Even the more moderate amendments, as you termed them, Nos 45 and 46, would still entail additional expenditure amounting to EUR 385 million.
We based our proposal on the financial framework agreed in Berlin, and I regret that I cannot therefore go along with your suggestions, especially in view of the fact that at virtually every summit the Heads of Government stress the importance and immutability of that financial framework.
I must also reject the suggestion that producers of sheep' s milk and goat' s milk be paid the same aid as farmers who only produce meat.
On the other hand, I was interested to note Amendments Nos 31 and 35 proposing additional premiums in the event of a price crisis.
But the draft regulation does already provide for a kind of safety net to come into effect if falls in prices disrupt the market.
I cannot therefore agree to those amendments.
The proposal in Amendment No 20 that the first 15 sheep livestock units should be disregarded for calculating the stocking density for the beef and veal arrangements refers to a problem that actually belongs not in the context of this regulation but in the context of the market organisation for cattle, and I must therefore reject this proposal in this connection.
But I would willingly agree to return to this point in the Midterm Review when we shall be discussing the question of the beef and veal arrangements and how they work.
Amendments Nos 5, 7 and 33 are concerned with imports from third countries.
Unfortunately, these amendments run counter to our international obligations and cannot therefore be accepted for that reason.
Traceability is another important aspect.
Amendment No 8 proposes that the report on the environmental effects of sheep and goat farming to be prepared by 31 December 2005 should also look into this question.
I understand that and fully share your concerns, but I believe that this problem really needs to be solved sooner and that we cannot wait until 31 December 2005.
The first step towards better origin safeguards requires the creation of a reliable marking and registration system.
Since such a proposal requires a different basis in law, the proposed amendments are simply outside the scope of this regulation because under this regulation the relevant legal basis would be lacking.
But I do think that part of Amendment No 42, which links the granting of premiums to compliance with the marking and registration rules, seems a sensible approach.
I shall at any rate put such a proposal before the Council.
Amendment No 19 is concerned with allowing Member States to show greater flexibility when setting application periods.
This question will be settled in the implementing provisions.
A Council decision is not therefore required here; it falls within the competence of the Commission.
To avoid cases of fraud, however, an efficient marking and registration system ought to be operative for that reason, too.
Finally, I would like to thank you again for the report and the amendments.
In some areas there is a consensus, in some I shall pass your concerns on to the Council even though I cannot formally accept the amendments in their present form, and unfortunately there are also amendments which I am unable to accept because I do not have the authority to approve the funding.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.25 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)
Reopening of Mont Blanc Tunnel
The next item is the statement by the Commission on the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel.
Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic accident in the St Gotthard Tunnel yesterday morning reminds us of the tragic fire of 24 March 1999 in the Mont Blanc Tunnel.
But before I say anything about the reopening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel, I would like on behalf of the Commission to express my deepest sympathy to the families of those who have lost their lives and also to extend our sympathy to the Swiss authorities and the Swiss people.
Even if the causes of the accident are not yet known, this event again raises in a most pressing and dramatic manner the question of the safety of long road tunnels.
The reopening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel does not require Commission approval.
This decision is the sole responsibility of the French and Italian authorities.
The imminent reopening of the tunnel has, however, revived a number of controversies.
First and foremost is the question of the tunnel's possible closure to heavy goods vehicles, something that the people living in the Chamonix valley had been calling for long before the disastrous fire.
However, the Commission takes the view that safety criteria alone should determine the reopening of the tunnel and the only condition should be that all the safety requirements are satisfied.
According to information available to the Commission, the tunnel has now been equipped with modern safety devices under French and Italian responsibility.
An electronic control centre has been set up, the electrical installations completely renewed, the ventilation system modernised, ventilated refuges created every 300 metres and emergency stopping bays every 100 metres.
In addition, the training of operating personnel and emergency services has been greatly improved.
As an additional safety measure, new rules have been introduced for the minimum distance to be observed between vehicles using the tunnel.
Finally, the two original operating companies, ATMB in France and SITMB in Italy, have been replaced by a single administrative structure, an important step bearing in mind that, according to a number of technical reports produced after the fire, the large number of casualties was due, among other things, to poor coordination between the two operators.
The Commission has contributed EUR 22.5 million to the repair work, which cost around EUR 200 million.
As a result of this disaster and the two subsequent fires in Austria - the fire in the Tauern Tunnel on 25 May 1999 caused by a pile up that claimed 12 lives and the fire in the Kaprun glacier railway on 11 November 2000 that cost 156 people their lives - the Commission decided that, together with experts, it should also examine how tunnel safety might best be optimised.
Our conclusions form part of the White Paper on transport policy up until the year 2010.
Knowing that tunnels are important features of many cross-border transport links, the Commission is planning European rules.
These are intended to create the necessary conditions for guaranteeing users of road and rail tunnels, especially tunnels forming part of trans-European networks, a high level of safety.
The Commission will pass a proposal to this effect to the European Parliament and the Council early in 2002.
The most recent accident once more underlines the fundamental importance of controlling transalpine traffic flows.
The Commission considers it an absolute priority that the two rail links already mentioned in the 1996 guidelines for the trans-European transport network, namely the Lyons-Turin link and the section across the Brenner, should be developed and taken into service without delay.
It has informed the competent ministers of this on many occasions, urging them to take the necessary measures to expedite these projects and in particular to give thought to how they will be funded, not excluding public-private partnerships.
Apart from creating new infrastructures to cope with the bulk of freight transit traffic in the region, the Commission will be formulating minimum requirements for safety in tunnels, as announced in its White Paper.
In the White Paper, the Commission also proposes a new scheme for transport infrastructure charges to take greater account of the external costs of the various transport operators.
This new charging policy should make a major contribution to creating a balanced relationship between transport operators, especially in sensitive regions like the Alps, favouring the most environmentally friendly among them.
As part of its strategy for sustainable mobility, the Commission will also be proposing revision of the Euro-toll disc directive to allow cross- financing for new railway infrastructures.
Accordingly, the Commission has also proposed signing the transport protocol to the Alpine Convention on behalf of the European Community, which will be a political signal for the creation of a balanced relationship between transport operators, even if the corresponding provisions may in some cases be handled with a degree of flexibility.
In general, the Commission intends to make European transport systems sustainable and to take into account medium and long-term environmental objectives when doing this.
A Communication to be presented by the Commission next year, will discuss this in greater detail
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot begin a debate on this subject without remembering the ten latest victims claimed by the St Gotthard tunnel, and Mr Fischler was quite right to pay tribute to them, but we must also remember that, this very morning, yet another incident took place in the Petit St Bernard tunnel.
It seems almost to be an unfortunate coincidence, placing a greater onus on us, now that we are preparing to debate the proposal and the timeliness of whether or not to reopen the Mont Blanc tunnel.
As I shall say later, I have no doubts on the matter, but there are many considerations I must air before I make this statement.
First of all, the St Gotthard accident is directly connected with the one in the Mont Blanc tunnel, where, as everyone will remember, 39 people lost their lives on 24 March 1999, but there is an even more direct link than just the similarity between the two accidents, which it is only right to recall.
It is a link of cause and effect: it seems clear to everybody that the mass of traffic that the Mont Blanc has not been able to cater for during the two and a half years or so since it closed has inevitably shifted to other Alpine passes, starting with the St Gotthard itself, which in turn is now closed, and then the Brenner and the Tarvisio and the whole Alpine arc, which, in short, has absorbed the surplus traffic that used to go through the Mont Blanc tunnel before it was closed.
It is clear, therefore, that the cause of the accident can be quite easily identified and predicted, given the situation. Alongside the negative effect of the accidents, however, there is, of course, another negative effect, which is the impact on the environment.
Heavy vehicles, especially those crossing an Alpine pass, certainly have an environmental cost that nobody would want to pay.
Quite rightly, therefore, people have started discussing the subject of the Mont Blanc tunnel, particularly in the last couple of days, and proposals have been made to try to prevent the tunnel from reopening and thus protect the land around it.
I must say that I totally disagree with this proposal, although I understand the legitimate aspirations of those living in a particular area to protect their environment.
This proposal, however, not only contravenes the Treaty - in that it would violate a fundamental principle, that of the free movement of goods, persons and so on - but I would say it is also an ethical violation. By closing the Mont Blanc tunnel or keeping it closed, one is in fact just shifting an ecological problem from one part of the Alps to another; we would just be shifting the problem from the Mont Blanc region to the Fréjus region, to Switzerland, and to the Brenner and Tarvisio routes, as I said before, which does not seem right to me.
I ask those who advocate this solution: what kind of proposal is this?
What has become of the spirit of Alpine solidarity? What has become of the feeling of belonging to the Community, to the European Union?
On the other hand, as the Commissioner has also reminded us, the opening of the Mont Blanc tunnel will certainly be accompanied by special safety arrangements.
It goes without saying that, in addition to the environmental damage, there is also the economic damage that we have a duty to consider here: during the two and a half years that it has been closed, it has been calculated that Italy alone has lost EUR 1 500 million, and the Val d' Aosta region will have seen its own regional gross domestic product fall by 10 %.
France, too, has probably had losses comparable to these: perhaps Mrs Grossetête will tell us, as I know she is to speak afterwards and she lives in that part of the world.
We must not be ashamed to talk about the economic aspect as well, since the Mont Blanc tunnel, like all passes through the Alps, responds to demands which are not solely economic but may be expressed in economic terms, and which need to be met to enable the various nations, citizens and groups operating in the fields of industry, trade and tourism to carry on their activities.
All this serves not only the countries on either side of the border but also and especially more distant countries - I am thinking of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany - whose traffic inevitably has to cross the Alps, which are today almost closed off and practically impassable.
It is also clear that the Italian and the French authorities have, at last, found a common language in which to propose solutionsand have invested almost EUR 300 million, the burden being shared equally by the two countries, to ensure safety.
It is said that once this tunnel has been restored - which I hope will be very soon - it will be the safest in the world, with features that I will not repeat now because they have already been mentioned by the Commissioner himself.
Now we need to take one further step: to speed up the bureaucratic and technical process to complete the Munich-Verona link, which means the Brenner tunnel, and the Lyon-Turin link, which means the Fréjus tunnel.
These are priority projects.
I shall end, Mr President, by reminding the House that there is a new proposal that might help: the Aosta-Martigny rail link, which starts in Milan, is not one of the European priorities but could be included if France and Italy take the matter up.
By the way, I shall close with some news: tomorrow the Italian Minister, Mr Lunardi, and his French counterpart, Mr Gayssot, will be meeting to agree on a date to reopen the Mont Blanc tunnel, which I hope will be very, very soon.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the opening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel is a European event, a happy European event, just as the accident in the St. Gotthard Tunnel is a tragic, sad European event.
Transport knows no borders.
It makes no difference whether you are a member of the European Union or not.
We need transport that connects the regions of Europe, but we also need transport that respects the environment.
I believe the Commission' s approach is correct in seeing the question of tunnel safety in the overall context not only of transport policy but also of environmental policy.
The Commissioner mentioned, for example, the transport protocol to the Alpine Convention.
I just wonder - the Council is not here - where the ministers are who signed it because it is high time the governments took action here.
Secondly, the Commissioner spoke of a shift from road to rail, where that is possible and worthwhile.
Here, too, a number of European governments - the Austrian government among them - have been slow in putting that into effect.
The plans are good.
But the financial resources must also be made available if the measures in question are to be taken.
I also know that in many countries the railways have the capacity to carry more freight than they do at present.
The White Paper that was mentioned and which the Vice-President of the Commission has presented, is a very positive and important step in the restructuring of transport policy.
Our Group strongly supports it and I hope that the announced presentation of the amendment to the Euro-toll disc directive and the infrastructure costs directive will not be delayed, and that we shall be able to discuss the Euro-toll disc revision very soon.
Finally, there has been a lot of talk recently of a fast-track procedure.
We have talked about it a great deal and very often, and this is a subject where we really could introduce a fast-track.
I am sure it is right that it is not only a question of overriding transport policy but also of the level of safety.
We welcome the Commission' s intention of prescribing safety standards here because if the tunnels we travel in are unsafe we are all affected.
A number of things have been mentioned.
I would like to add that the question of working hours is particularly important for lorry drivers, as is the matter of controls, because it does not matter how good the rules are that we adopt if these things are not enforced.
This, too, is a matter for the individual countries to act on.
My Group and I are quite clear in our own minds that this is not about pitting one country against another.
France, Italy, Germany, Austria and all the other countries of the EU have a right to the free movement of goods.
But the people who live in the Alpine regions also have a right to a healthy environment.
Some people may laugh or smile at the fact that the UN has designated next year the year of mountains.
However, it really is high time special attention were paid to the environmental situation, in the Alps and the Pyrenees in particular.
Now, Mr President and Mr Commissioner, I must ask to be excused.
I am going to be rude and leave the room now because I am going to Romania on Parliament' s behalf.
But we nevertheless endorse these principles of a really environmentally-friendly transport policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted this debate is happening at last.
As the Member for the Val d' Aosta, I have been calling for a moment' s reflection in this House for many months, because I believe these issues should be resolved through institutional channels, this is the true alternative to futile protests.
It is sad that this should happen on the day after the accident in the St Gotthard tunnel, which used to be referred to as one of the safest of tunnels, and, what is more, in Switzerland, which is the only European country - not yet part of the European Union - that has truly embarked on a policy of transferring freight from road to rail.
Mont Blanc has always been a symbol: it has been the symbol of mountaineering and also the symbol of road transport, with this tunnel built in the 1960s, which for many years was the most important tunnel in the Alps.
Nobody could ever have imagined that we would see such intense growth in road transport, and I must say that 24 March 1999 was, for those who saw it, like me, a tragic day: the sight inside the tunnel was truly appalling.
I believe that all these events should serve to make it clear that extreme positions on both sides are useless.
The extremist approach adopted by those who say 'stop the HGVs' is unrealistic. It offloads HGVs onto someone else and proposes a utopian world without transport and without mobility; naturally, however, we must also say no to those who call for 'unlimited transport for all: the economy needs it.'
I believe this is an unsustainable position for mountain peoples like those in the Val d' Aosta, whom I represent, just as a pretence at a setting a limit would also be unsustainable.
In fact, we are asking for a daily ceiling on HGV numbers - a genuinely effective serious limit.
On the eve of this meeting, Società Autostrade, the motorway operator, told us that, according to the tunnel calculations, traffic will be 30 per cent lower than before the tragedy.
I do not know if this will suffice, but I must say that the right approach is in the White Paper, the Alpine Convention transport protocol and the Swiss model. Under the swiss model, it was decided to agree to HGVs if they pay a tax and to invest the revenue, together with other capital, in rail tunnels.
We want rail tunnels: we want the Turin-Lyon tunnel; we also want the Aosta-Martigny tunnel, this rail project that may acquire vital, decisive importance.
In the meantime, however, we want real, serious limits for the sake of safety and the environment.
Mr President, Commissioner, the St Gotthard disaster, which has caused many victims, incontrovertibly belies the arguments that prevailed in Mr Gayssot' s decision to reopen the Mont-Blanc tunnel.
We cannot limit ourselves to lamenting the victims.
We must finally take action to definitively stop this flood of disasters and we have good reasons for demanding this in Parliament.
From the environmental point of view, reopening the Mont-Blanc tunnel goes against the commitments given by the European Union and its Member States on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
What is the point of our voting in favour of sustainable transport and switching from road to rail if, at the first opportunity to show determination to reverse the 'everything by road' trend, this option is removed?
In the two years of work on the tunnel, rail freight transport has not increased. It has remained static at 10.5 million tonnes per year, whereas additional rail capacity does exist and the 13.5 million tonnes that transit every year through the Mont-Blanc tunnel could have been absorbed by rail if capacity had been doubled for transit through Mont-Cenis, through the link that runs south of Lake Geneva and through the Dijon-Valorme link.
It is incomprehensible that this rail solution should have been ignored, since it represents a transit capacity of up to 20 million tonnes per year via trans-Alpine routes.
I should like the Commissioner to take note of this point, because I am giving him very practical proposals.
It seems, however, that he is not interested.
I would, therefore, like to say to him that we completely disagree with his analysis of the safety of the Mont-Blanc tunnel.
This is another reason why we do not accept that it should be reopened.
The EUR 200 million' s worth of work that has been undertaken, without an impact assessment or a public inquiry, does not meet the highest safety requirements.
The tunnel is still a narrow (seven metres wide) single-direction tube that has no tarmac-covered and, therefore, fire-resistant surface, central escape hatch or parallel evacuation tunnel.
The old ventilation duct will be used for evacuation.
Safety must be of primary importance for all forms of transport and not only, as you stated, for air transport.
The Commission must, therefore, reject the reopening of the Mont-Blanc tunnel and accept the proposals that the Commissioner has ignored, but which are perfectly appropriate alternative proposals, which seek to use the railways for transit through the Alps.
Mr President, this debate comes just a few hours after another terrible tragedy in the St Gotthard tunnel, with ten people known to have died and eighty missing, according to the latest news.
This tunnel has the same specification as the tunnel rebuilt under Mont Blanc: substantially the same technical specification as regards safety, with the same carriageway width of about seven metres, or even worse, in that the Mont Blanc tunnel has no parallel service tunnel.
Having heard the Commissioner, I have come to the following conclusion: more disasters will have to happen in order finally to persuade the European Commission to give up its policy of White Papers, which no longer apply, and the associated illusion that technology can solve any problem, and make it realise that a 40-tonne lorry in a seven-metre-wide tunnel is a lethal weapon.
Commissioner, we must ask the governments involved to delay the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel so that we can seriously reconsider what kinds of vehicles should be allowed to use it.
We must say no to large HGVs; we should place a strict limit on the number of HGVs that can go through each day and we should ban dangerous loads.
This is the only way we can prevent further disasters.
Mr President, the events of yesterday morning have, unfortunately, plunged us once again into the Mont-Blanc tunnel disaster and this debate that we are having today has become more topical than ever.
I totally agree with Mr Santini when he says that closing a link such as a tunnel beneath the Alps causes real economic problems, and I fully understand this, but nor do I feel that we can call for it to be reopened unless all safety guarantees are met.
Furthermore, even today we still do not know the real causes of the accidents that take place in these tunnels, any more than we know what guarantees we may be given that they will not happen again.
I am sorry first of all that the Council is not present to hear this debate, even though the Commissioner made it quite clear that this concerns a principle of subsidiarity.
I am sorry that the Council is not here to say what it intends to do within the framework of a land-use planning policy.
We are never given answers to our questions on the real trans-European networks, be they railways or roads.
Incidentally, Mr President, Commissioner, I should like us to jointly put pressure on the Council to give us answers.
We cannot keep on asking the same questions, when terrible accidents unfortunately occur, which are still unanswered two or three years later.
I would, therefore, say that it is now crucial that we question the Council and that we should have a real land-use planning policy that takes account of the railways and which plans the trans-European road networks so that such disasters cannot happen again.
Mr President, allow me to add my condolences to those expressed to the families of the victims and the citizens of Switzerland in general for yesterday' s terrible accident in the St Gotthard tunnel.
Road tunnel accidents have been on the increase in recent months, and this makes it particularly urgent for safety measures not to be delayed any further with White Papers and vague proposals.
The reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel, already well behind the schedule agreed on by the Italian and French Governments in January 2001, must take place within the framework of a number of conditions to ensure traffic safety and reduce environmental problems to a minimum.
In concrete terms, it is a matter of putting into operation traffic control mechanisms inside the tunnel, so that, with the application of new technologies and the constant presence of surveillance personnel, any accident will be picked up straight away.
Traffic must also be regulated to prevent too many heavy goods vehicles being in the tunnel at the same time; such vehicles could be allowed through in only one direction at a time, for instance, and there could be tighter speed limits and other similar measures. A definitive list should be drawn up of goods banned from being transported through the tunnel, and, in this respect, let us remember that the St Gotthard incident would not have been so serious if one of the HGVs had not been carrying material as flammable as tyres.
We should also adopt any other provisions that will help distribute commercial vehicle journeys evenly among the all-too-few road tunnels linking Italy to Europe.
We will only find a solution to the many problems posed by road tunnels if, of course, there is a definite shift of freight from road to rail, and it is in this direction that the Union should be directing its efforts.
Such a shift, however, is a process that takes time, and so it seems rather unrealistic for those people, who are without doubt moved by the best environmentalist intentions - which we all share - to call today for the total closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel to commercial traffic.
It should be noted that in Italy, at least, those same people are also protesting at the building of a new, faster high-speed railway line between Turin and Lyon, designed precisely to help distribute goods transport more evenly, which just shows how contradictory or even absurd such positions, held by certain Italian political groups, can be.
While, therefore, we share the environmental concern to protect the alpine environment of the Val d' Aosta, we must not fail to take into account the economic interests - including jobs - that the tunnel implies, particularly for the valley itself and also for Italy as a whole.
These legitimate interests are in fact reflected in surveys carried out in the valley, according to which the great majority of the citizens want the tunnel to reopen.
What we ask is for the tunnel to be reopened with the safety measures mentioned above implemented, and, at the same time, for there to be a decisive international initiative to develop a new rail infrastructure, including, in particular, the new Turin-Lyon line, improved commercial traffic handling on the Turin-Bardonecchia-Amberieu line, and the widening of the Col di Tenda tunnel and the Aosta-Martigny tunnel.
We call on the Italy-France intergovernmental commission, set up under the January 2001 declaration, to report to the European Parliament on all this as soon as possible.

Mr President, Commissioner, so despite the proven risks, despite the hostility of the communities of the valleys, it has been decided to reopen the Mont Blanc tunnel to heavy goods vehicles, deliberately sacrificing the alternative of rail transport.
The Maurienne valley, the Fréjus tunnel, the valleys of Briançon, the Mont Genèvre pass and the Chamonix valley deserve a better fate than being merely HGV fodder', as the Savoy League put it.
Alas, it seems that the road transport lobbies come before the health of the inhabitants, the safety of travellers or respect for sites of outstanding beauty.
What have the countries concerned done since March 1999 to replace road with rail?
Not a thing.
Between the first half of 2000 and the first half of 2001, rail freight between Italy and France fell by 8% and combined transport by 10%.
In face of such lack of foresight, I can only support the request from the Savoy League for an independent international agency - which could be the Commission - to draw up a report on the Alpine passes between France and Italy and for, in the meantime, the Alpine tunnels to be reserved for tourist traffic and regional and inter-valley traffic, with strict limits on size and tonnage.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in 1999 we had the Mont Blanc tunnel disaster.
Yesterday, we had another tragedy, in the St Gotthard tunnel.
This chapter of disasters is certainly not coincidental, it is the human price we pay for basing our goods transport system on HGV transport and pursuing the maximum profit, which creates terrible risks.
Since the Mont Blanc tunnel was closed, the Maurienne valley has had to absorb the weight of all the traffic and is suffocating as a result.
The St Gotthard tragedy will lead to even more re-routed traffic for the valley to absorb.
Even in normal times there are not enough crossing points.
So we need to tackle the problem of transit transport.
We have to look for global solutions.
In this context, reopening the Mont Blanc tunnel would mean ensuring that the correct distances between vehicles are observed, that road traffic is regulated, that partial traffic bans are observed, that ceilings on lorry numbers are imposed and observed, that the limits laid down for lorry-drivers' working hours are observed and that safety rules are continuously monitored.
Finally, it would mean undertaking to develop 'piggybacking' and making immediate use of the existing transverse lines, which are under-used.
We urgently need to review the entire policy of goods transport in Europe.
The Union must finance adequate investment to that end.
I think that in sensitive areas we should give up road goods transport, which means that, as of now, we have to mobilise the necessary resources for speeding up the development of piggybacking.
The European Union must now show the political courage to make new and bold choices.
Thank you.
Mr President, the recent tragic accidents have again made us all aware that we have a lot of catching up to do in road transport in particular, especially when it comes to developing infrastructures for intermodal transport systems.
I do not want to prolong the debate unnecessarily, but I would like to ask a very open question. Which way will the traffic go if the Mont Blanc Tunnel, the St Gotthard Tunnel and the St Bernard Tunnel are closed?
I am very much afraid - and that fear is shared by the population of Austria and the population all along the Alps - that the traffic will then go over the Brenner Pass and that we will have major problems in that highly sensitive region of the Alps, problems that will affect not only North and South Tyrol but also Trentino.
I therefore implore you to be really forward looking in tackling this issue because it is not only a matter of road safety but of the environment in which many people live.
Mr President, I was told I had three minutes' speaking time but no matter.
I would like to say briefly, now that another accident has occurred in the St Gotthard tunnel, that I think there is a difference between learning lessons from that accident and exploiting its emotional charge for political ends.
If we use the deaths in the St Gotthard tunnel, which, of course, we all deplore, as a pretext for saying that we must not reopen the Mont Blanc tunnel, then we should also close the Fréjus tunnel, the Arlberg tunnel and the Brenner Pass. In fact, we should close every Alpine tunnel that presents the same accident risks.
Clearly, that would totally paralyse southern Europe because, quite simply, we no longer have a choice today.
As everybody here knows, the railways are not ready either institutionally, technically or economically to take over from the roads.
Therefore, it seems to me that we have to take two kinds of measures, short term and long term.
In the short term, we must make the tunnels safer and take urgent measures, whether in Mont Blanc, where this has now been done, or in other tunnels, to regulate the traffic, ensure that no hazardous materials are carried through, strengthen the security, safety and intervention systems and speed up the adoption of a European directive on tunnel safety.
This is much talked about but it has not yet materialised, so we must put it on the agenda very soon.
That aside, like everyone else here I believe that, in the long term, we should quite simply be able to ban, once and for all, heavy goods vehicles in tunnels because they are, in fact, the most dangerous vehicles, but that assumes that alternatives exist, and the Commission has, indeed, presented them in its White Paper.
There are other projects too that need to be speeded up, including, in the case of the Alps, the two rail tunnels, the one between Lyon and Turin and the Brenner tunnel; there are similar projects in the Pyrenees, where the traffic situation is even more serious, although this is never mentioned.
I believe we must also assume our responsibility here and speak out.
For my part, I feel we are still far from doing so.
The Commission has produced an excellent White Paper; it is very good at laying down requirements, but it has not as yet paid out enough to enable us to make the transition to rail in the very short term.
We therefore need to allocate far, far greater resources to improving rail capacity.
Let me finish by saying that public opinion is now concerning itself with transport policy - which is a good thing - and as a result, it is no longer a matter just for the specialists, for the large State bodies.
It means we will all be judged by whether we can implement rapid solutions, not just the politicians but also the railwaymen and the hauliers.
Let me conclude by saying that I also hope we will not confine ourselves to imposing constraints while rejecting all the solutions.
In regard to north-south transport, I think we should also look again at adapting the Rhine-Rhone canal to heavy goods transport.
We cannot say that we have to put a stop to road transport while, at the same time, rejecting transport by river and inland waterway which would relieve much of the pressure on the roads.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking you for your contributions to this debate; they were all very constructive and sought to find a solution to this very grave problem.
On the quite specific question of signing the Alpine Convention, the Commission will endeavour to get the Council to sign during the course of the Belgian Presidency.
On the other hand, the primary concern is naturally for safety.
I do not think it will work if we now quite simply push all safety matters up to the European level.
Everyone must see to it in the areas for which he or she is responsible.
The national authorities must do that just as much as we have to fulfil our own responsibilities, but we cannot take over the responsibilities of the national authorities.
So the fact is that the question of reopening and the question of safety standards must be settled primarily by the French and Italian authorities.
There is a procedure for that.
That procedure has been completed and we have the result.
If those authorities come to the conclusion that reopening is justified, then that is what must happen.
On the other hand, we must also be clear at European level that we can only act within the framework of our own competencies.
The fact is, too, that the very White Paper that my colleague Mrs de Palacio has presented, is intended first of all to clarify those competencies and secondly also to see that traffic becomes even safer and also that the environmental effects of traffic are kept in check so that there is no further damage to the particularly sensitive areas of the European Union.
Regarding the question of the Euro-toll disc regulation, as I said, we shall be submitting a draft for it in 2002.
In this connection we shall also be considering whether it is necessary to create some kind of transitional arrangement for the transit agreement with the Republic of Austria.
Essentially, this depends on how quickly our Member States and the European Parliament can agree on the contents of the White Paper.
It will not be possible to actually implement these things until we are in a position to create a new, improved infrastructure costs directive and adopt the other parts of the White Paper.
We therefore have the answer to the question.
The Commission has no way - no legal way in particular - of preventing the opening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel.
But I am very much in favour of an appropriately intensive debate on the new White Paper so that definite decisions can be taken as soon as possible.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of the Commission statement on the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel earlier than expected.
The following report, by Mr Lannoye, is set for debate at 4.00 p.m., and this time cannot be changed.
This being the case, we have no choice but to suspend the sitting and resume at the previously fixed time.
(The sitting was suspended at 3.46 p.m. and resumed at 4.00 p.m.)
Fisheries and poverty reduction
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0334/2001) by Mr Lannoye, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Commission communication on fisheries and poverty reduction [COM(2000) 724 - C5-0071/2001 - 2001/2032(COS)].
Mr President, this communication from the Commission deals with a key issue for the developing countries: how can the fisheries policy conducted by these countries help reduce poverty?
I will now present the resolution adopted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation under a special procedure - the Hughes procedure - which means the Committee on Fisheries was closely involved in drawing up the report. Let me also point out that the resolution fully endorses the opinion delivered by the Committee on Fisheries.
In the report and the resolution, we start from two key premises. Firstly, in the developing countries, the respective contribution of the coastal communities to food security and employment make this sector a major factor of sustainable development and poverty reduction in these regions.
Secondly, and unfortunately on a less positive note, we find a constant depletion of fish resources in these developing countries' fishing zones.
In the context of fisheries relations between the European Union and the developing countries, the Committee on Development believes that we need to encourage observance of the principles of the FAO's Code of Conduct for Responsible Fishing.
Let me remind you of the main points of this code: application of the precautionary principle in resource management, giving priority to the needs of coastal communities in the developing countries and, in particular, those engaged in small-scale fishing, active participation by those directly concerned, namely the local communities, and, finally, cooperation at sub-regional, regional and global level in promoting the conservation and management of resources.
To that end, the Committee on Development proposes a range of strategic measures focused on the need to ensure coherence between the European Union's sectoral policies and its development policy.
I am thinking, of course, mainly of fisheries policy but also of regional policy.
The first proposal set out in the resolution is that EU development policy must pay greater attention to the developing countries' fishing industry by drawing up country-specific cooperation strategy documents resulting from the political dialogue between the European Union and the country concerned.
The second is that account must be taken of the need to improve the living conditions of coastal communities in the context of the various priority intervention areas defined within this cooperation strategy.
Thirdly, we must apply specific mechanisms to reinforce the organisations representing the small-scale fishing industry, and in particular in the area of processing fisheries products.
I am thinking here of women's organisations, which are extremely important in the developing countries and have relatively few operating resources.
Fourthly, in the context of the fisheries agreements, abiding by the precautionary principle means carrying out prior scientific assessments of available resources; if there are any doubts, this precautionary principle must indeed be applied, meaning we must take the lowest hypothesis as the basis.
Fifthly, it is important for the European Union to support surveillance and monitoring programmes in the developing countries' exclusive economic zones.
We are all aware that some of these countries do not have the necessary technical means to do so.
That is why it is important for the European Union to make its contribution, so as to avoid over-fishing and the poaching activities of certain vessels.
In that spirit we must also help these countries combat flags of convenience and other vessels which fish illegally in their exclusive economic zones.
Finally, our resolution calls on the Council to amend FIFG, so as to put a stop to grants of subsidies to Community ship-owners for transfers to flags of convenience.
I have not gone into every aspect, but I am sure my colleague, Mr Varela, in the Committee on Fisheries, will be happy to present the particular points his committee has proposed.
.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Fisheries has unanimously approved the report for which I was rapporteur and that today is included in the Lannoye report.
I requested the Hughes procedure, because the matter has a profound effect on both fisheries and development cooperation.
I sincerely believe that we in the Committee on Fisheries have significantly improved the original draft of the Lannoye report.
We have contributed to focusing and balancing the hitherto exclusive point of view of the Committee on Development and Cooperation and particularly the opinions of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, that were held on this matter.
International fisheries agreements are not harmful to fishing, to the European Union, or to third countries, as is sometimes claimed.
On the contrary, they are beneficial to all.
We should try to ensure that this mutual benefit is enjoyed by all those concerned, and this cannot be achieved only by means of the CFP.
The development cooperation policy should become more involved, with more economic, financial and technical measures, as requested by our report and as shown in the information given in the explanatory statement.
International fisheries agreements are trade agreements as the Council of the European Union acknowledged, even though they are dedicating more and more of their own funds to cooperation, yet they are of fundamental importance to cover the deficit in the supply of fish in the European Union and for jobs in Europe' s Objective 1 regions that we must also treat as a priority.
Employment and economic and social cohesion in Europe are fundamental political principles of our Union.
Are we keen to preserve the resources of third countries?
Of course.
Is anyone more conservation-minded than the European Union?
Would other foreign fishing powers, in Asia, for example, which would take our place if we left them to it, have more respect for these resources?
Of course not.
I think that the criticisms voiced in the Lannoye report on the agreements with Mauritania and Senegal are completely unfounded.
I also disagree with the regional approach that is proposed, because international fisheries agreements apply to exclusive economic zones that are come under the sovereignty of third countries, and each State is sovereign and has different political and economic interests.
Multilateral cooperation in international waters would be another matter altogether.
I think, Mr President, that our Parliament has taken a positive step forwards.
We would still ask the Commission to coordinate its cooperation and fishing competences.
Parliament has set an example by coordinating our two committees and I think that this is right way to defend European interests, combining principles that we all advocate, such as the conservation of mankind' s natural resources and the eradication of poverty in the Third World, which requires development cooperation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as we all know, reconciling various Community policies is a task that is necessary, but not always easy.
To put it simply, when we are involved in the fight against world poverty, our work is not only important: it is crucial.
Fish are a universally scarce resource.
For the coastal communities of the poorest countries that live exclusively from fishing, it is a precious resource on which their very survival depends.
We are, therefore, very pleased with the Commission statement on fisheries and poverty reduction and endorse Mr Lannoye' s report, both of which provide an intelligent definition of principles and suggest options that will enable us to reconcile supply for the Community market with the catching, processing and marketing of fish from the countries with which we have fisheries agreements.
There is a wise Chinese proverb, which teaches that acting responsibly involves 'not giving a man a fish but teaching him how to fish' . This proverb is also applicable here, but with some changes because the fish we catch in other waters belong, first of all, to other countries.
Promoting scientific research into resources and the equal sharing of this knowledge with developing countries, aid for the organisation of local communities that depend on fishing, improving and promoting mechanisms for regional cooperation and support for fighting against flags of convenience and illegal fishing are, therefore, only some of the measures that show that the course of action now being proposed is the right one for us to take together.
Mr President, on many occasions I, like many other of my fellow members, have lamented the lack of coordination between different Community policies and between the various Directorates-General of the Commission. I could even say the same for the Parliamentary Committees in this House.
There would be no contradictions between the common fisheries policy (CFP) and the development cooperation policy if Community instruments - the budget, to be precise - were more transparent.
The European Union funds cooperation in fisheries with these countries in two different ways: international fisheries agreements and projects funded by the European Development Fund.
An increasingly large proportion of financial compensation from the agreements is for this purpose - with regard to Madagascar, for example, it is 62% - which is not, of course, the ideal situation, given that the CFP is being asked to fund actions or compensations that have nothing to do with its real objectives.
Those who say that the Community does not help the fisheries sector of developing countries are wrong.
In response to a question I asked recently, Commissioner Nielson informed me that the Community had undertaken, with funding of EUR 421 million from the European Development Fund, 334 programmes, projects or actions to support the fisheries sector in these countries.
I would remind you that the largest current fisheries agreement, the agreement with Mauritania, involves around EUR 80 million per year.
I think that nothing could be of more use to the progress of developing countries than mutual trade with the European Union.
Fisheries agreements allow them to obtain financial resources in return for giving the Community fleet fishing rights on various perishable resources whose capture, processing and marketing, require specialist companies and methods that these countries do not have themselves.
In the same way that it would be absurd for us to oppose these countries' exporting their agricultural products to Europe, it would be appalling if we were to deny them the opportunity of selling their surplus fish supplies at international prices.
This ill-informed approach to development cooperation would lead us to prevent developing countries from exporting their mining products to us, or to ask European energy companies to abandon these countries so that local companies can carry out operations, or to not pay Gabon or Nigeria the international price for a barrel of oil.
Lastly, it is worth pointing out that the fishing grounds where the Community fleet operate are in international waters that do not belong to any one country, but are in Exclusive Economic Zones, according to the International Law of the Sea Treaty, that obliges all countries to leave the surplus resources from these zones that they cannot exploit themselves for other countries to use.
This should take place within the framework of the sustainable management of resources, which is what the CFP is designed to achieve.
The fishing carried out by the Community fleet that operates in these waters is compatible with the local small-scale fleet, which maintains the monopoly within a 12-mile zone.
An interesting project for all those involved would be to help those countries to better manage this zone where spawning takes place and where the highest concentration of young fish is to be found.
I congratulate Mr Lannoye on his excellent report and I ask everyone here to continue working on this cooperative approach.
Mr President, poor, small fishermen are missing out because there are too many big rich fishermen.
The European Union is suffering from severe excess capacity in the fishing industry, and is solving this problem by shifting some of the production to developing countries.
Instead of modernising the fisheries sector, more than EUR 1 billion of government money is being spent on doing so every year.
Naturally, the governments of poor countries are delighted to receive large sums of money for allowing large-scale fishing in their waters.
However, it is better to facilitate the development of the indigenous fishing industry in economically weak countries than it is to let local fishermen bob about in their boats while the enormous proceeds from the catches are credited to the accounts of big European ship-owners.
The precise consequences for fish stocks and the environment are unfortunately still unknown.
However, it is certain that small, local operations will not be able to compete without subsidies or state support, and will thus continue to suffer a marginal existence.
The Spanish and Portuguese fleets in particular will have to be curtailed in the foreseeable future.
Furthermore, there must be much stricter supervision of the way in which the developing countries spend their compensation payments.
This spending must fit in with the policy of targeted poverty reduction.
Local fisheries must also be involved in the spending to a much greater extent.
The European fisheries policy must be brought much more closely in line with European development policy.
The European Union must systematically provide technical assistance for transferring knowledge about fisheries resources to developing countries.
Most importantly, the poor countries must gain the know-how, the capacity and the investment they need in order to be able to fish in their own waters in a responsible way.
In the longer term we must move away from these fishing agreements, which maintain redundant European fishermen but which cause developing countries to miss out.
Mr President, a debate on fishing and poverty is not simple.
And, since the rapporteur belongs to the Group of the Greens, Mr Lannoye' s efforts towards synthesis are all the more creditable.
Poverty is the world' s main problem today and it unfortunately will continue to be so for many years.
For some of the poorest countries in the world, fishing is one of their main resources; in fact, for many of them, it is their only economic resource.
Mozambique receives 75% of its total income from the export of crustaceans, and this is a perfect example of a model of sustainable development.
The rapporteur, Mr Lannoye, should be credited with proposing a realistic text, which retains a laudable dose of utopianism.
I must say that the Commission' s proposal is coherent with the objective of responding to European interests, while making it compatible with a frame of reference for the development of countries for which fishing is an essential resource in their fight against poverty.
I have mentioned the case of Mozambique, but it would be unfair not to say that there are other very positive aspects to this African country' s efforts to move forward, and there are other African countries which are acting well in relation to fishing, such as Namibia, to give but one example.
It seems pertinent to insist on the need for the Union to be especially careful in complying with the code of conduct for responsible fishing, to which we are committed as members of the FAO.
We must wait for the authorities of the developing countries to make the same effort.
It is true that certain practices - as Mr Lannoye has mentioned - in certain specific cases of Community operators are unacceptable, but it is also the case that, sometimes, these practices would not be possible without the cooperation of the local operators involved.
This problem is serious and complex and I therefore repeat that the efforts of the Commission and the rapporteur are creditable in that they offer us a balanced approach to it.
Mr President, at a meeting a few days ago of Portuguese and Spanish Socialists in Santiago de Compostela, we said that European Union policies must always be judged in terms of the added value they contribute in the field of social cohesion.
We thereby insisted that our Union must be, amongst other things but, for us, essentially, a great framework for intra-European solidarity.
Naturally, this approach also goes for the actions of the united Europe in its relations with other countries, in particular the developing countries.
So the policies of the European Union relating to these countries must also be judged in terms of the added value they contribute in relation to social cohesion, in other words, in terms of their contribution to progress towards a more balanced world with fewer inequalities.
Therefore, while agreeing with the excellent and - in my opinion - not utopian report by Mr Lannoye, and speaking for the Parliament' s Committee on Development and Cooperation, we Socialists believe that we must take this criterion into account in assessing our fisheries policies and the agreements with third countries which make up these policies.
I will not say that these agreements must be seen fundamentally as instruments of our development cooperation policy.
We understand that there are other legitimate objectives, including the defence of the interests of the fisheries sectors in the Member States of the Union.
But we would say that this fisheries policy must not contradict what we do in the field of cooperation and, above all, it must not contradict, either in the immediate, medium or long terms, the priority strategic objective we have set in the field of development cooperation, that is, the eradication of poverty in the countries of the South.
In summary, we aspire to a fisheries policy which is coherent with what we are doing in relation to development cooperation.
A fisheries policy which, at least as a collateral effect, contributes to the eradication of poverty in the countries with which we sign agreements so that we may fish in their waters.
As well as respecting our partners and their rights as owners of those waters, we must learn the necessary lessons from our experience, which led us to exhaust the fish stocks off our coasts.
It would be intolerable to repeat the same mistake in the fishing grounds of people for whom fishing may provide resources which are important for their own future.
This respect and coherence with our goal of sustainable development for all must prevent egotistical and conceited actions by us, and by others who, equally irresponsible, through fishing activity in the third world, brought to reality the Spanish saying which says that we 'brought these people bread for today and hunger for tomorrow' .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, fishing is an activity that mankind has practised throughout history, but it has never been a great source of wealth, as demonstrated by the fact that the Neolithic revolution was achieved through agriculture and not through fishing.
Although the European Union' s fishermen currently enjoy a degree of protection and guarantees that offer them an acceptable standard of living, albeit lower than that of many other workers, the same cannot be said, unfortunately, of the fishermen and fishing communities to be found throughout the developing countries.
For these reasons, the Commission communication should be welcomed, praised and supported, since it contains a clearly humanist approach that is enlarged upon in Mr Lannoye' s report.
This acknowledges that fishing is an essential activity for many developing countries, but is threatened with extinction because resources are scarce and pressure on the various species is increasing.
The fisheries agreements that the European Union concludes with third countries are essential to the survival of activities and cultures that are an integral part of the history and identity of many European countries.
Nevertheless, these agreements cannot ignore and fail to respond to their impact on the vulnerable economies of the world' s poorer countries and regions.
We therefore need to reconcile the legitimate interests of Community fishermen and consumers with the interests of poor communities in developing countries and with the preservation of fish stocks that are often devastated by an irrational method of fishing, that is also carried out under flags of convenience.
In conclusion, the golden rule in this field must be to integrate the external requirements of the common fisheries policy into the overall policy of support for development already embarked on by the European Union.
Lastly, I should like to express my support for the excellent work by Mr Lannoye, which shares, as I have already said, the Commission' s inspiration and contains extremely constructive and fair proposals to which we must give our support.
Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the very wide-ranging report and the proposed motion for a resolution, the content of which was formulated by the Committee on Development in close cooperation with the Committee on Fisheries.
I also would like to sincerely thank you, Mr Lannoye, for your valuable work on this in your capacity as rapporteur.
Your motion for a resolution stresses the need to take greater account in future of the development potential of local fisheries, especially small-scale coastal fisheries, and the needs of fisheries-dependent coastal communities.
As is clear from the Commission communication entitled 'Fisheries and Poverty Reduction' , the Commission wants to take a more sector-based approach in promoting closer partnership and political dialogue with the developing countries.
The developing countries' responsibility for determining their own development priorities and interests will be recognised and also directly encouraged.
Let me now turn briefly to the various development problems that should in future be taken into account in fisheries agreements and to which you expressly refer in your resolution.
The following in particular are mentioned as necessities. The quantities that the Community fleet is allowed to catch must not result in local fish stocks being decimated, and fisheries agreements must be signed only if they are compatible with sustainable development of the sector in the developing country concerned.
The Commission is of the opinion that these principles, mentioned in the resolution, for taking account of development questions in the external aspects of the common fisheries policy are in harmony with the principles set out in the Commission communication on fisheries and poverty reduction and in the Green Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy.
And we do in fact respect them when concluding fisheries agreements with third countries.
In accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, we base our fisheries agreements on the available surplus stocks that the third country in question does not fish.
The Commission also expressly shares the view that the principle of sustainable management of natural resources must be more strictly applied.
These same principles will also be taken into consideration in the debate on the reform of the common fisheries policy initiated by the publication of the Green Paper a short while ago.
Let me come to a final point, which concerns improved coordination between development cooperation policy and the external aspects of the common fisheries policy.
I can say that the Commission shares Parliament' s view on this.
The country and regional strategy papers produced in cooperation with the developing countries must pay greater attention to the link between development cooperation and the external aspects of the common fisheries policy.
We will therefore also be addressing this subject in connection with the reform that is now being prepared.
This really is my final point: Mr Lannoye, you pointed out that it would be important to suspend structural aids from the structural programmes if a ship is transferred to a third country.
On this I can say that in the discussion about the extension of MAGP IV, which is coming next, we shall have to bear in mind that this thought has already been taken up in the proposal for extending MAGP IV and it is already part of the proposal.
I hope that this will also meet with Parliament' s approval.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place this afternoon at 6.30 p.m.
Community fisheries (1997-2001)
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0316/2001) by Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a
1. Council decision amending Council Decision 97/413/EC concerning the objectives and detailed rules for restructuring the Community fisheries sector for the period from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2001 with a view to achieving a balance on a sustainable basis between resources and their exploitation (COM(2001) 322 - C5-0308/2001 - 2001/0128(CNS));
2. Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector (COM(2001) 322 - C5-0309/2001 - 2001/0129(CNS)).

Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, the Committee on Fisheries accepts that in extending the rules concerning restructuring and structural assistance in the fisheries sector for one year, changes need to be made in the pilot reduction rates in order to maintain current levels.
It welcomes the tightening up of provisions concerning the transfer of fishing vessels to third countries.
Amendment No 6 to Article 1(3) asked the Commission to produce a list specifying which transfers are permissible and which are not.
We hope it will be acceptable to them.
The committee also welcomes the possibility of financial assistance being made available where any Community legislation imposes technical restrictions, but feels that Parliament should be kept informed of such cases - that is Amendment No 10.
From this point, the Committee on Fisheries has difficulties with the Commission proposal in that it goes beyond an extension of the rules to making three substantive changes to them.
These are: removing the possibility of an increase in capacity on safety grounds; allowing financial assistance for fleet modernisation and renewal only where objectives have been met purely by reduction in capacity; and allowing such financial assistance to any segment of the fleet only where every segment of the fleet has met its objectives.
In voting the report, the Committee on Fisheries rejected each of these three changes.
The motivation was mixed, relating both to the desirability of the changes themselves and the desirability of making them in the course of a one-year extension of the programme.
For example, both the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Legal Affairs took the view that requiring every segment of the fleet to have reached its objectives before any segment could benefit from financial assistance ran counter to the principles of natural justice.
Similarly, the proposal that financial assistance could be given only where objectives had been met purely by a reduction in capacity seemed unfair to those fleets where capacity and activity reductions had been combined.
There are also doubts about making such a change in circumstances where there is increasing agreement that a variety of measures are needed to reduce fishing effort.
Amendments Nos 4, 7, 8 and 9 are intended to maintain the status quo in relation to both these requests.
The most difficult point has concerned the removal of the possibility of capacity increases on safety grounds.
The Committee on Fisheries is highly committed to fishing safety.
There is serious concern that shipowners simply will not make safety improvements unless they are given additional capacity for this.
It was also argued that abuses of the provision should be prevented by proper controls and that such a change, if to be made at all, would be more properly done in the reform of the CFP as a whole.
It is largely on the capacity issue that I part company with a number of my fellow committee members.
Of course, we must find ways of ensuring that vessels are safe, but we can no longer afford to take risks with conservation either.
The perilous state of cod stocks in the North Sea is but one example.
Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 5, approved by the Committee on Fisheries, reject the changes on the capacity rules altogether.
Amendments Nos 11 and 12, submitted by the ELDR Group, however, accept the Commission's approach in principle, but seek to allow capacity increases on safety grounds by way of exception for existing vessels under 12 metres.
The justification for this exception is that taking away the possibility of financial assistance is likely to bear hardest on the sector and put safety improvements more seriously at risk in circumstances where they are likely to have only minor effects on capacity.
I know that many of my colleagues - for reasons that I respect - will wish to take a different view, but I urge everyone in deciding how to vote on this report to bear in mind just how imperative the need for conservation has become.
Mr President, it is a pleasure to speak on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, substantially in support of what my colleague, Mrs Attwooll, from the Committee on Fisheries, has said.
The Committee on Legal Affairs looks at this issue through legal spectacles, as you would expect.
From our point of view, it is not just important that the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy be achieved, though that is indeed important.
We have to remember that the means through which the Community does this are means of the law, and therefore the principles of the law have to be respected in what is done.
The Committee on Legal Affairs thought that the Commission's proposals fell down on two important legal principles, at two important points.
The first was the principle of proportionality, and in effect Mrs Attwooll has already spoken about that this afternoon.
In recital 3 the Commission said: "Measures to improve safety should not lead to an increase in fishing effort and such measures should therefore be applied within the existing capacity objectives for the fleet".
That is to say that improvements in safety can be ignored just if the capacity objectives are not being sustained, regardless of effort.
But the aim we all have is to prevent over-fishing, and it is effort that catches fish, not capacity.
Therefore proportionality requires deletion of that.
Secondly, in relation to the effective provisions about vicarious penalties.
To require all segments of a national fleet to have achieved the annual objectives, as the Commission suggests, before any public aid for fleet modernisation or renewal can be granted, would be unlawful.
It is contrary to the most rudimentary principles of natural justice.
It would permit one fisheries segment to be penalised for things done, or left undone, in another.
It could result in fishermen being penalised for the acts or omissions of their government and would thus constitute vicarious punishment.
As a Scottish Member, I insist that these issues matter vitally to all parts of the Scottish fleet.
Those who meet their targets for reduction of capacity should not be punished for those who do not and should not carry the can for failures by the UK Government or the Scottish Government.
Mr President, first of all, I commend my colleague, Mrs Attwooll for the work she has done in this report.
Although we are only dealing with an extension of MAGP IV for one year, the Commission proposals seek to reduce over-fishing and achieve the 40% reduction in effort across the EU fleet which they have been consistently pointing out is absolutely essential, if we are to have any hope of a sustainable industry in the future.
I know that some controversy has arisen - and Mrs Attwooll mentioned this - over the question of aid for measures to improve safety in navigation; working conditions; and hygiene on board fishing vessels.
It goes without saying that all of us wish to see our fishermen working in the safest, cleanest and most secure conditions.
But there is no doubt that such aid has been abused in the past to increase fishing effort, leading to further over-exploitation of dwindling fish stocks.
It seems to me pointless that we try to achieve a reduction in over-fishing as a core policy objective on the one hand, while continuing to facilitate cheating at the taxpayer's expense on the other.
The whole point of the MAGP is to reduce fishing effort and bring it into better balance with the existing fish stocks.
Only this week the need for continued for vigilance in this area was again highlighted with the publication of the ICES report on the prospects for catches in 2002.
They point out that a number of fish stocks remain in a state of great jeopardy, particularly cod, although they also point out that there have been slight improvements in haddock and whiting stocks in the North Sea.
In that respect I was horrified to read that Danish fisheries inspectors last month boarded a Danish industrial fishing boat and discovered 114 tonnes of juvenile cod in a 543 tonne total catch that was supposed to be composed entirely of sand eels.
Pulverising valuable young haddock into fishmeal to feed to salmon in the fish farming sector is complete madness.
It is a crime against everything we are trying to achieve.
I hope that when we come to vote on this report later today, we bear in mind that the whole point of MAGP philosophy is to reduce over-exploitation and nothing we do in applying public aid to the EU fleet should undermine that principle.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Attwooll for the magnificent work she has done on this report which is going to be so useful to us.
Adjusting the Community fleet to the resources available is a fundamental objective of the CFP.
Furthermore, it is a common sense requirement if we want our fishing to be a viable economic activity and our fishing sector to be a viable economic sector.
We therefore welcome the extension of the current MAGP IV until 31 December 2002.
As I have said, the Socialist Group supports Mrs Attwooll' s report, which was approved by consensus in the Committee on Fisheries, and we thank her for the compromise achieved in our committee, together with the Members presenting amendments, a compromise which the Council is still far from reaching.
Parliament is sending a good signal by anticipating an agreement which the Council can accept.
The Commission' s proposal is not restricted to extending the current MAGP by one year, but it also intends to introduce, as has been said, criteria relating to safety, which should be debated in the context of a new MAGP.
I regret that the Commission has not made any reference to the question of safety in the White Paper on the reform of the CFP.
I would like to point out that, as this House approved (on debating and approving my report on fishing accidents), Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the application of measures to promote the improvement of health and safety of workers in the workplace is also fully applicable to vessels of less than 12 metres.
We ask for preventive measures, with a view to preventing accidents, both in relation to the design of vessels and life-saving equipment and to the introduction of rules of management of resources with consequences for human safety, the size and power of vessels.
Lastly, I would like to point out to Commissioner Fischler that if there is one thing we were unanimous on during the hearing organised by the European Commission to present the Green Paper, it was precisely the fact that Community aid for the modernisation of the fleet should remain in force.
Let me begin by saying that the Greens support the proposal of the Commission for both the FIFG and the MAGP.
We also agree with the rapporteur's amendments seeking to restrict the derogation for safety to vessels less than 12 metres in length and we would like to thank her for retabling these important amendments.
However, we are entirely opposed to the proposal as it has now emerged from the committee.
The amendments are removing the most progressive elements that the Commission is proposing.
After all, both the MAGP and the FIFG are already so full of loopholes that you actually sail The Atlantic Dawn through.
The proposal would simply close a couple of these more blatant loopholes.
Glancing through a scientific report on the status of fish stocks makes for very depressing reading these days.
It does not matter whether it is ICES, or the STECF or any of the regional bodies such as NAFO.
Everywhere you look fish stocks are over-exploited and far too often severely depleted.
The EU has had to take emergency measures for three cod stocks and northern hake and it is clear that other stocks will soon be added to the list.
There is pretty much universal agreement that this deplorable situation is due to the excess capacity of the world's fishing fleets.
The Commission is always reminding us of this, but the Member States and certain segments of the fishing industry are clearly in denial.
The Community has agreed to several international instruments which seek to control fishing capacity and/or fishing effort.
For instance, the FAO Code of Conduct provides that states should take measures to prevent or eliminate excess fishing capacity and should ensure that levels of fishing effort are in line with sustainable use of fisheries resources.
But whenever the Commission tries to put these obligations into effect, they are shot down by Parliament and the Council.
Some have argued that it is not reasonable to try and change a programme in the last year or that certain aspects of the proposal are contrary to the idea of natural justice.
The FIFG is due to continue until 2006 and so there are several years in which these reforms could bring some sort of positive effect.
Surely it is far from natural justice to refuse to take action now and to continue as if the future is bright, only to have more and more stocks decrease and to impose even further temporary or permanent closures.
I would ask the Members of this House to consider the case of the northern cod stock off Newfoundland which provided 200 000 tonnes of fish every year for five centuries.
In 1992, the Canadian Government had to close the fisheries even for subsistence fishing and there is still little if any sign of improvement in the stock.
Is that the kind of future we want for our own coastal communities?
The time has come for us to take a long-term rather than just a 6-months to 12-months view.
We really have to deal with this issue and I would like to support what the Commission is proposing.
Mr President, Commissioner, the decision to extend the expiry date of the MAGP-IV until the end of next year, so as to include the results of the negotiations on the reform of the common fisheries policy, must not be used to undermine the interests of the countries that have so far met and even exceeded the reductions laid down in the MAGP, such as Portugal, whilst there are other Member States have not only failed to meet any of their targets but have even increased their fishing capacities.
Equally, it is incorrect - as the rapporteur and various other Members have stated - to attempt to table amendments on the expiry date of the MAGP-IV that would have a detrimental effect on maritime safety, on the quality of life and safety of crews, on the value and quality of catches and on health and hygiene conditions.
The Commissioner must, therefore, review the position he expresses in the proposals submitted to the European Parliament and accept most of the positions put forward by Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries.
Mr President, Commissioner, if policy instruments are not working well, you adapt them, and if the adaptations do not produce a result, you abolish them.
With this principle in mind, I was unpleasantly surprised by the Commission proposal before us.
I well understand that the Commission does not want to introduce a new structure policy which may be obsolete within a year as a result of the fisheries policy reforms.
However, I cannot shake off the impression that the Commission still does not realise that they are missing the boat with the current multiannual guidance programmes.
To try to control fisheries with two very different instruments - the TACs and the quota on the one hand and the fleet structure policy on the other - will result in serious problems, particularly if the policy instruments serve different objectives, which is the case.
TACs and quotas are the determining factor in managing fish stocks.
Sustainable fishing can, nonetheless, only be achieved if there is room for an efficient fleet within the parameters set by the allowable catches.
The fleet structure policy must support this.
Unfortunately this is not happening.
Under the MAGP, all kinds of subsidies are offered which are maintaining excess fleet capacity and therefore distorting competition.
What is more, a number of Member States have introduced incentives which are further distorting competition.
The common fisheries policy needs a clear objective, and the system of TACs and quotas must be the determining factor for this.
This must also include a properly functioning control system with strict punitive measures.
At the moment, the Commission is, nonetheless, holding onto its MAGP, with some changes which I can only describe as unfortunate.
Under the guise of reinforcing the suitability of the MAGP, the Commission is ignoring the most elementary sense of justice in one of these amendments.
By withholding government support, it is punishing one fishing segment for the excess capacity in another.
Justice is further undermined by the Commission making a distinction based on the capacity reductions in the fleets.
The fleet in my country regulates capacity by reducing activity (the "days at sea restrictions" ).
Unlike other countries, the Netherlands is now excluded from European support for modernisation and renewal.
In order to reverse these unfortunate changes, we will give our wholehearted support to the rapporteur's amendments.
Mr President, under the pretext of extending MAGP IV for a further year so that it will coincide with the expected reform of the CFP, the Commission's intention was further to tighten up this instrument, which has become as disastrous for our small-scale fishing industry as it is ineffective in terms of regulating fishing.
Thanks to the efforts of Mrs Attwooll and the Committee on Fisheries, I hope we have avoided the most unfair and dangerous aspects of this tougher line; more generally, however, the very principle of MAGPs needs to be questioned now.
The professionals have never accepted this bureaucratic, brutal system, which is totally alien to the traditions and culture of the maritime world.
Experience also shows that this instrument is crude, unfair, redundant and costly.
Its negative effects are well-known and, coupled with the blocking of aid for new construction, it bolsters the second-hand market and dissuades young people from going into jobs connected with fishing.
Within the framework of the debate in progress on reforming the CFP, we must therefore give absolute priority to the system of TACs and quotas.
That has to be the instrument used to keep catches in line with resources.
The new CFP must be based on the quota mechanism, which we need to fine-tune by putting it on a multiannual basis, making it more transparent and more scientific, relating it more closely to the fishing zones, closely involving the professionals and monitoring it effectively and fairly.
Mr President, Commissioner, let us forget MAGPs and perfect the quota system; then we will be doing a good job.
Mr President, Commissioner, we did not need the Green Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy to tell us about the serious problems facing fisheries in Europe.
The Green Paper has merely made clear once again how serious they are.
Our Committee is earnestly discussing the various approaches to solving the problems.
We know we shall not be able to make all the difficulties simply disappear by waving a magic wand.
If somebody really wants to pull the wool over our eyes about it, we must call it what it is, namely eyewash.
The common fisheries policy as it has existed up until now has not succeeded in preventing the crises affecting a number of fish stocks or in reducing overcapacities in fleets.
Whether we will all survive economically depends on the Union' s future ability to shape a fisheries policy in the new century.
The Commission is now proposing extending the current multi-annual guidance programme for one year.
In the light of the ongoing debate on reform, I think we also need such measures for the sake of continuity.
We cannot of course solve the problems in this short space of time, but perhaps we can alleviate them a little.
The crucial thing is that the programme should be properly carried out.
We need data, but some Member States fail to provide that data or their data is incomplete.
We therefore need a system of penalties to ensure the data is supplied at all, and we need comparable criteria and categories.
Every shipowner wants to increase efficiency.
But we must not shift the premises.
We want better safety at sea.
That is a central part of the European Parliament' s demands.
But at the same time we should be careful to avoid negative effects on safety, even dressed up as increased efficiency.
The proposed change to structural measures also misses the target at the present time.
Making the achievement of objectives in all segments of the fleet a precondition for public subsidies is counterproductive because it penalises everyone for the failings of a few.
Our policy will only find acceptance among fishermen if the conditions are fair.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, extending the multi-annual guidance programmes by one year to keep them in force pending the decision on future fleet policy after 2002 is sensible and I think it has everyone' s support in principle.
The MAGP' s objectives are correct, but their implementation by the Member States still leaves much to be desired.
The Commission' s reports in the past have shown us that over and over again.
We have repeatedly criticised the failings in implementation and it is clear that the future fleet policy will have to remedy the situation.
That is why the Commission wants to make changes to the MAGP and FIFG provisions as well as extending them by a year.
I am opposed to some of those changes because I think these matters would be better resolved in the landmark decision about fleet policy.
In my opinion there is no point in making extensive changes in the last year of MAGP IV' s validity, especially when they could have negative repercussions for safety on board fishing vessels.
But if Member States are to continue to be able to apply for increases in capacity for measures designed to improve on-board safety and fishery product hygiene and these are to be paid for out of FIFG resources, something really must be done to ensure that those measures do not result in increased fishing.
This condition is absolutely essential.
We cannot have a situation where investments in on-board safety are prevented because the conditions for the application of the measures are not complied with or because many Member States are sometimes unable to ensure that they are or fail to do so.
We ought to be using the debate about common fisheries policy reform to find solutions to the dilemma between on-board safety and careful management of stocks that has again been made clear by this report.
No way must the one be at the expense of the other.
Mr President, I should like to add my thanks to the rapporteur, a fellow Scot, for her work on this document, and likewise to my SNP colleague, Mr MacCormick, for leading the Committee on Legal Affairs' consideration of this report which I support.
The size of our fishing fleet in the European Union is one of the greatest problems that we are faced with when considering CFP reform, but the real measure of activity should be effort as opposed to fleet size.
In order to secure what we all want, sustainable fisheries, then surely fishing effort must be made to correspond to available resources.
I agree with the need to extend MAGP4, but I have some concerns, in three areas in particular.
Firstly, it is intolerable that safety has been taken out of the equation.
The provisions that currently exist to increase objectives on grounds of safety should be maintained.
We should be looking for tighter control and management to ensure that these provisions are not used to circumvent the rules.
Safety must remain a priority and I hope the Commission will recognise this and also make up for its failure to include adequate provisions on safety in the Green Paper.
Secondly, while there must be penalties for non-implementation of MAGP targets, surely they must be targeted at the guilty parties.
It must be wrong to penalise one segment directly for the acts or omissions of another.
It is also necessary to make sure that those Member States which claim to have met their MAGP targets are not simply transferring their vessels to other flags.
Thirdly, the proposals which limit financial assistance from FIFG to segments where reduction of fishing effort is obtained through capacity reductions only seems to me unjust and would discriminate against fishermen whose Member States choose to reduce effort through schemes such as days at sea.
One reason why these targets are not met is that some Member State governments have not been prepared to match funding for restructuring.
The Commission must look at ways of ensuring that restructuring funds can be distributed in an equitable fashion throughout the EU fishing industry.
There is a need for more standardised and more rigorous assessment procedures right across the EU.
Only if we have fixed, clear and comparable criteria for the measurement of vessels, including engine power and tonnage, can there be confidence in the targets that are set by MAGPs.
Mr President, I would also like to thank Mrs Attwooll for her cooperation leading to a compromise which, in my opinion, very much improves the Commission' s two proposals, which were originally untimely and doomed not to be complied with.
It is hard to accept that, six months before the end of a programme to restructure the fleet, the sector can be told, without scientific or technical justifications, that fishing capacity cannot be reduced by means of restructuring efforts and that the only solution is pure scrapping, all because the Commission made a small calculation error four years ago.
And that, furthermore, while they are at it, they take the opportunity to turn the bases of MAGP IV and key elements of the FIFG Regulation on their heads, which is completely unacceptable, and I believe there is general agreement on this here.
If we add to this the fact that the greatest burden of the new requirements, as has been said, rests on the elimination of the facilities intended to improve the safety of ships, it begs the question of whether the Commission ever thinks about the fisheries sector when it starts coming up with brilliant ideas at the last minute.

I therefore ask that you vote in favour of the amendments of the Committee on Fisheries because I still cannot understand, and the sector understands even less, what is the point in reserving safety measures just for vessels of less than 12 metres, when it is precisely the largest ships which have more crew and work furthest from the coast and therefore face considerably more risk and, in the event of emergency, have most difficulties getting back to port. And all of this with winter just around the corner and in waters which, like European Atlantic waters, are not exactly a mill pond.
It is fair to recognise that the Commission tried, from the outset, to coincide the end of the MAGP IV with the reform of the CFP in 2002.
But, since 1997, it knew that it was not going to manage it and on that basis the Commission should have started work on an MAGP V which would have eliminated the errors committed so far and, meanwhile, simply extend the MAGP IV.
And extension, Commissioner, cannot in any way be used to change the rules of the game which we have had up to now.
Mr President, I would also like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, for the spirit of consensus she has created in our committee in order to arrive at compromise amendments, particularly with Mrs Fraga Estevez and to substantially improve, as has been said, the Commission' s proposal on a key issue, which we all recognise, in the current common fisheries policy and in the policy that we are creating for the coming years.
European fleet policy is a sensitive and complicated issue - this is something we all agree upon.
However, if each State defends its own interests and only complies when it is in its own interest, we clearly get nowhere.
Therefore, the Commission must rise to the challenge, through an effective policy accepted by everyone, of designing a fleet that is really suited to our fishing needs.
A safe, effective and competitive fleet.
Mrs Attwooll' s report, like the report by Mr Busk, is currently of fundamental importance.
We want it to draw attention, on the one hand, to the fact that the increase in onboard safety measures has nothing to do with increasing fishing capacity or power, and on the other, to the need not to introduce substantial last-minute changes to programmes which have been in operation for five years, because an annual extension is one thing, but to change fundamental conditions in the general philosophy of the MAGPs now, at the last minute, is quite another.
I therefore hope that the House supports this message which the Committee on Fisheries wants to send this afternoon, and that the Commission will, of course, take it into account.
Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking you, Mrs Attwooll, for preparing this report.
I have been listening to the debate very attentively and now feel somewhat obliged to clarify a few things because there seem to be some quite serious misunderstandings about this Commission proposal.
First there is the question, do we need a fleet policy or not?
In my opinion we do need a fleet policy and we need an effective - and more effective - fleet policy because the present rules are far from adequate.
We have tremendous overcapacity in our European fleet as a whole, and if we do not adjust that fleet to possible future fishing opportunities, we will never be rid of these difficulties.
I would also like to say to you clearly and in all honesty that we will not meet that objective at all with MAGP IV.
With MAGP IV we are a long way from achieving a reduction of 30%, let alone 40%.
There is a report with which you are probably familiar, I hope you are, which says that we will at best achieve 5% over the full MAGP period and even that is very unlikely.
What is more likely is that the entire MAGP IV exercise will have had no effect.
That is the reality, that is the truth and that is what we have to deal with.
But there is a second principle we must see as well. In my opinion it makes little sense to isolate fleet policy from the rest of the common fisheries policy.
We must see it in the context of the other essential political elements of our common fisheries policy.
We therefore believe that it is entirely correct to include consideration of the future of fleet policy when devising our new common fisheries policy, which we intend to do next year.
The proposal we have submitted can be understood only in this light.
MAGP IV expires next year and that would mean that we would have to isolate all other areas of the new fisheries policy from that of fleet policy.
That is why we had the idea of seeking this one-year extension so that they could be synchronised.
But we do not really want at the same time to lay ourselves open to the charge of prolonging an ineffective arrangement for a year.
That was why we also proposed a few measures to improve this MAGP.
There is also the fact that a few Member States are not even keeping to the modest targets of MAGP IV.
Unfortunately, the Commission has no other way of enforcing compliance with the MAGP objectives than to introduce proceedings before the European Court of Justice.
That is why we have also submitted proposals to that effect.
This brings me to the amendments that have been tabled.
Amendments Nos 1 to 3 and 5 are concerned with the question of safety at sea.
Here, too, I want to clearly say that no one should accuse the Commission of being against more safety at sea.
We too are aware of the problems and accidents that have recently occurred at sea.
So we are also aware of how necessary it is to improve safety, and we are also promoting that.
Community resources are being deployed to improve safety.
I do not dispute that in some cases enhancing safety increases the weight of the ships.
But that has nothing to do with the fact that we cannot therefore demand that the increase in weight of just one ship should be compensated for by taking more ships out of use.
That is what this is about.
After all, there is no prohibition on installing more additional safety devices on a particular vessel.
That is why we are not prepared to accept these four amendments.
We are able to accept Amendments Nos 11 and 12 because the application of the safety clause remains confined to vessels under 12 metres in length that no longer fish with drag nets.
This is of particular benefit to older vessels that are engaged chiefly in coastal fishing and for which an increase in capacity and engine power are justified, subject to clear conditions, if that enhances safety.
I am quite concerned about Amendments Nos 4, 7, 8 and 9. They reject any form of restriction on access to FIFG aid.
But this is after all the only mechanism we have for reducing fleet capacity at all.
It must be obvious that the Community' s lavish modernisation aid is thwarting all our efforts to reduce the size of the fleet.
How will it ever work if we first offer Community public funds for ships to be broken up and then also use Community funds to encourage the purchase of new ones?
At some point we are going to have to decide which of these two things is to have priority.
Parliament has also said in this connection that it is not appropriate to amend the provisions of a regulation that was adopted less than two years ago for a period of six years.
In view of the present difficult situation regarding stocks, I think the time has now come to talk about this question, too.
Finally, Amendment No 6 amplifies a provision that was included in the regulation at your instigation, and that provision bans FIFG aid for exports or for the formation of joint ventures.
We have already discussed this point in connection with the previous agenda item.
The Commission is in total agreement on this point and suggests that the lists of countries that break these rules should also be published.
Finally, the Commission is unable to agree to Amendment No 10 because it involves a procedure internal to the Commission, for which the Commission alone is competent.
It ought therefore to be handled under the Commission's aegis.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
EEC/Senegal fisheries agreement
The next item is the report (A5-0314/2001) by Mr Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation [COM(2001) 422 - C5-0405/2001 - 2001/0168(CNS)] on the conclusion of two Agreements in the form of exchanges of letters concerning the extension of the Protocol establishing the fishing opportunities and financial compensation provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Senegal on fishing off the coast of Senegal for the periods 1 May 2001 to 31 July 2001 and 1 August 2001 to 31 December 2001.

Mr President, Commissioner, this proposal for a Council regulation concerns the prolongation of the fisheries protocol which has been in force between the EU and Senegal for the period of 1 May 1997 to 30 April 2001.
The prolongation concerns two periods. The first period is from 1 May 2001 until 31 July and the second from 1 August 2001 to 31 December.
After several rounds of negotiations starting in Brussels in January 2001 no agreement was reached between the EU and Senegal on the renewal of the current protocol.
Last June, Senegal suspended negotiations until October in order to gain time to analyse the fisheries issues and their effects.
Breaking off the negotiations did not have the same negative impact as it had at the end of 1996 when all fisheries were suspended.
This time there has been no suspension and good sense has prevailed on both sides.
According to estimates by Senegal's research institute, which was carried out in 1996, the available resources at that time would permit catches of some 465 000 tonnes.
However, recent scientific analysis has shown that, in spite of the satisfactory utilisation rates in this segment, coastal demersal resources have plummeted and have forced the small-scale and industrial fleet to fish in neighbouring countries.
Of course, sustainable fishing is one of the leading principles of the common fisheries policy.
Signals about the critical state of some fish stocks must be taken into account by both parties when negotiations are resumed.
Until the date of resumption of negotiations, the Senegalese Government is carrying out a new study to determine the country's present fisheries potential.
Since the question of durable management was one of the breaking points at the negotiations, the Senegalese Government will make use of the results of this study later this year in negotiating with the EU.
The fisheries possibilities and the financial contribution from the Community have remained unchanged.
The compensation to be paid by the Community for the eight months of this year will be calculated on a pro rata basis, meaning that the compensation for the period 1 May until the end of the year will be two-thirds of the yearly sum of EUR 12 million.
That payment has to be made by the end of the year.
I believe, as does the Committee on Fisheries, that it is important for Community fishermen that this agreement be renewed after 31 December of this year when the current prolongation expires.
The renewal of the protocol is now more important than ever in terms of fishing opportunities, after the failure to reach agreement with Morocco.
I am not trying to compare the opportunities in Senegal with Morocco, but the fact is that there are other opportunities there.
We cannot compare them because the protocol with Morocco would have involved EUR 500 million over a four-year period.
When, therefore, we consider the recently signed agreement with Mauritania, costing EUR 430 million over five years, the Senegal agreement is very modest in financial terms.
In the light of all these considerations, I can recommend this report to the House.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Gallagher for the speed with which he has worked on his report in order to allow the approval of these two extensions which, as he has pointed out, allow the continuation of fishing activity until the signing of a new protocol with Senegal.
We must also recognise the sensitivity shown by the rapporteur in not presenting amendments so as not to interfere with the result of the negotiations currently under way, although he indicates that the results of those negotiations will have to be analysed in line with the considerations expressed in his report.
I almost entirely agree with the considerations, but I would like to expand on the rapporteur' s reference to the lack of utilisation of the agreement by pelagic trawlers.
The rapporteur refers to the fact that, in the Northern agreements, criticism has been made of the existence of 'paper fish' or 'paper quotas' and that also, in this case, payments should only be made in exchange for real fish.
I would like to point out that these situations are in no way comparable.
In this case, fishing opportunities really exist and, being a Southern agreement, any interested Member State could chose to make use of them, just as in other categories of this same agreement entry has been granted to fleets that are not traditionally present in the area, such as those from Italy or Greece.
If these opportunities are not taken advantage of, it will be because certain States have not been interested, but I doubt that with the non-existence or non-continuation of the agreement with Morocco, these opportunities will not be utilised in the future.
In the Northern agreements, however, no Member State can fish.
It is prohibited, even if a State is interested; and you all know that certain fleets are interested in being able to fish within these quotas which are already paid for.
And we must also remember that, in this particular case, we are not talking about 'paper fish' because, as I have already stated, the fish really exist, unlike the cases of certain Northern agreements, where the state of resources is so poor that real fishing opportunities are not available, and which, by the way, are much more expensive than the agreement with Senegal.
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists is pleased that the Commission and the Senegalese Government have reached an agreement to extend the previous fisheries agreement with Senegal for eight months.
We are grateful to the Government of Senegal for their willingness to allow our fleet to continue fishing until the parties have reached a new agreement.
Fortunately, this time, the fleet has not been docked as it was five years ago.
In the interim, the Commission and the Senegalese Government have reached a new fisheries agreement, which will be the subject of another debate.
The catches the Community fleet can benefit from are the surplus resources which the local fleet cannot fish.
Fishing relations between Senegal and the European Union are wholly satisfactory to both parties.
We must not forget that fish products account for 30% of Senegal' s exports and these exports are mainly sent to Europe.
Furthermore, many of the landings of the Community fleet take place in Senegalese ports.
It would be wonderful if, in terms of what we are discussing here today (the coherence between the common fisheries policy and development cooperation policy we all want to see), the Commission could help the Senegalese authorities, and other developing countries, to manage their fisheries resources better, especially - as we have already said - in areas where there are young and spawning fish, which are in such need of it.
I therefore congratulate Mr Gallagher on his wonderful and, above all, rapid report, as well as his excellent work.
Mr President, thank you, first of all, to Mr Gallagher for a very fine piece of work on the report.
On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I should like to begin by adding a few remarks on the financing of the fisheries agreements concluded by the EU with third countries.
We have proposed that fishermen should make a greater contribution to the financing of these agreements.
It would be of benefit to themselves, but it would also, at the same time, be in line with current developments in the direction of a structure more in keeping with a market economy.
It is gratifying that the Commission has begun to prepare evaluation reports on the previous protocol.
The evaluation of existing agreements is an extremely valuable tool for improving the fisheries agreements. These must, of course, be to the advantage of European fishermen, who do in fact benefit from them, but also be to the advantage of local fishermen in the countries concerned with which the agreements have been made.
The agreement should relate to the surplus resources that cannot be caught by local fishermen.
Sustainability must be ensured.
That is the EU' s responsibility.
The fisheries agreements are exceedingly important to certain regions of Europe in which, in addition to jobs in the sector itself, there is a range of additional businesses dependent upon fisheries.
We should focus more upon the degree to which third countries make use of subsidies for the development of local fisheries and ensure that the development aid we provide is used in the best way possible and, especially, to benefit local fishermen.
These agreements are important to the Community, especially in the light of the fact that the fisheries agreement with Morocco was not renewed.
Mr President, I would like to join in congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Gallagher, on the sensitivity and speed with which he has produced his report.
I would also like to take advantage of the presence of the Commissioner to congratulate the Commission on the fact that, in the interim, we have been able to extend this agreement until the end of the year, which has allowed European fleets to continue fishing.
I would like to take this opportunity to say to Mr Fischler that I am naturally concerned about the repercussions of this agreement for the fleets which, after the failure of the negotiations with Morocco, are in a truly delicate situation.
All of this has its place within the framework of the debate we have held today on development cooperation and respect for the resources of third countries, certainly, but also in the knowledge that there are fishing opportunities which have not yet been utilised.
The agreement that has been reached with Mauritania - on which we must also congratulate the Commission, and on which our rapporteur, Mr Gallagher is also working hard - has broken the curse that was stopping us from signing agreements and, therefore, the agreement with Senegal must come to fruition.
I know that the Commission is working seriously and has meetings arranged for 20 and 23 November.
I urge it to work as quickly as possible and I also urge this Parliament to deal with it with the urgency it deserves, because it is of great importance in terms of the situation of the European fishing fleet.
First of all, I would like to thank you, Mr Gallagher, for your report on the extension of the fisheries agreement under discussion until the end of the year.
I am glad that you agree with the Commission' s proposal.
This will enable the Community' s fishermen to continue their activity in this region while - as the Senegalese side wanted - a further study of the fisheries sector is prepared.
The extension of the existing protocol also enables us to pursue negotiations for the multi-annual protocol without undue pressure of time and to bring them to a conclusion.
As you know, this agreement is a very important agreement for us.
At EUR 12 million a year, the amount of money involved is considerable, and in purely mathematical terms it means EUR 8 million for the eight months extension.
Apart from the considerable amount of money, the advantages for Senegal are not least that the agreement secures a major part of the raw materials required by the Senegalese fishing industry because EC vessels have to land part of their catches in Senegalese ports.
The Commission is unable to accept the present amendment because it is, as you know, a fundamental component of the Community' s external fisheries policy that the costs of fishing rights should be met partly out of the Community budget and partly by the ship owners.
That is included in all the negotiating guidelines for fisheries agreements.
The financial compensation payable is specified in the agreements themselves.
This is paid by the EU, while the ship owners have to pay the licence fees.
May I conclude by saying that the next round of negotiations for a new agreement or a new protocol is due to take place on 20 to 23 November.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
EEC/Madagascar fisheries agreement
The next item on the agenda is the Report (A5-0315/2001) by Mrs Fraga Estevez on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the proposal for a Council regulation [COM(2001) 409 - C5-0406/2001 - 2001/0161(CNS)] on the conclusion of a Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Democratic Republic of Madagascar on fishing off Madagascar for the period from 21 May 2001 to 20 May 2004
Mr President, I am speaking in order to present, and ask your support for, a new Fisheries protocol, this time with Madagascar - as you have said - with whom we have had relations since 1986.
From the point of view of what has come to be called cost/benefit, it is an excellent protocol which clearly demonstrates the viability of this type of agreement for the European Union.
In this case, the Community fleet, industry and market are ensured a stable supply of a raw material, tuna, of which we have a considerable deficit, by means of our own fleet, which means that many Community jobs will be retained, not only in the extractive sector, but also in the activities dependent on it.
Furthermore, the protocol once again demonstrates that, in the Southern agreements, a high proportion of the fishing opportunities are utilised, in this case reaching 91% for tuna seiners.
It is just as viable for Madagascar, which in addition to the EUR 308 000 in annual financial compensation, will receive a further EUR 517 000 for development aid actions, mainly aimed at improving the fishing control of the area and the training of its fishermen.
Furthermore, the number of Malagasy seamen which must be employed rises from 6 in the protocol currently in force to 40 in the protocol under discussion.
This is therefore a genuinely significant quantitative leap.
Community fishing activity in itself does not interfere with small-scale fleets, since our fleet does not have access to the twelve mile zone.
Meanwhile, the presence of the European Union in itself makes a significant contribution to the control and guarantee of greater sustainability of the resource.
We must not forget that the fleet carries with it all the control regulations of Community policy, which is a very important element in terms of ascertaining the details of catches and the state of the resource in the region, to a degree which cannot be matched by all the other diverse foreign fleets that fish in those same Malagasy waters.
Following this brief summary of the content of the protocol, and reminding you that, as a Southern agreement, the shipowners contribute to its funding, I would like to focus on two issues.
I would like to draw your attention firstly to the fact that with this agreement, as in Southern agreements in general, there remains the possibility of granting licences to those interested Member States that would not have access to the fishing opportunities on the basis of relative stability, as demonstrated by the presence of Italy and Portugal.
It is therefore time to ask the Commission once and for all to implement the views of the 1997 Council of Fisheries Ministers, which clearly request that fishing opportunities which remain unused may be used by interested Member State fleets in all agreements of the European Union.
Secondly, I do not believe it necessary to point out that we are all committed to the development of third countries, as clearly demonstrated by the Lannoye report, which preceded the debate on fisheries.
The fisheries sector has been one of the first to cooperate in this development, since its presence in the waters of third countries has been the catalyst for many of the first industrial centres in their coastal regions, if not the definitive element in terms of many nations now having taken on the genuine vocation of a fishing State.
But, having said that, I believe things are reaching the point where clarification is necessary from several points of view.
To begin with, we must not forget, as the aforementioned Council of Fisheries Ministers also made clear, that fisheries agreements are essentially of a commercial nature.
However, they are increasingly becoming a complement to Community development aid policy.
In the case of this agreement, the proportion intended for development cooperation actions is now rising to 62.6% of the total cost of the agreement to the Community budget.
This situation raises many questions.
Firstly, there is no reason why fisheries budgets should be financing the development policy budgets and, from the point of view of budgetary transparency, this state of affairs should be clarified as soon as possible.
Secondly, this situation should also be clarified in order to silence those voices which complain about the high budgetary cost of the fisheries agreements, when in reality, as we have seen, considerably more than half of that budget is pure development policy.
Mr President, the fisheries agreements the EU has signed with third countries have always formed a decisive part of its common fisheries policy.
I want to pay tribute to the excellent work carried out by Mrs Fraga Estéves, the rapporteur.
As a Member from Réunion, I am naturally interested in the conclusion of this seventh fisheries agreement between the EU and Madagascar, given its implications for fishing in the Indian Ocean and, obviously, off Réunion too.
Let me start by pointing out that there is an enormous paradox between the restrictions imposed by the establishment of a European common fisheries policy and the precautionary principle the European Union advocates.
In fact, at the same time that the Commission was refusing to countenance any increase in the rate of public aid for longliners in Réunion on the grounds that this resource could be at risk in this part of the Indian Ocean, it was also saying that this same resource was abundant enough to allow for an increase in catches under its fisheries agreements with third countries.
For those of us who come from Réunion, this is rather difficult to understand, as, moreover, I explained, in Réunion, to some of our MEPs in the Committee on Fisheries, pointing out that the fishing resources of this sector are young, specific and over-abundant, with the result that the catch quota criteria imposed by the common fisheries policy are inappropriate.
The rapporteur refers to the increased fishing opportunities given under the agreement between the EU and Madagascar, which will make it easier for fishermen from Réunion to acquire additional fishing rights in Malagasy territorial waters.
We would be allowing them to increase their catch quota, which, at present, accounts for only 0.12% of the total EU catch in this zone.
The fisheries agreements are the EU's main instrument for contributing to the development of the fishing industry in third countries.
A large part of the total financial contribution is allocated to this under the agreement with Madagascar.
Since it is quite familiar with the real situation in Madagascar, Réunion is prepared to offer its experience and to take part in co-development projects, based, in particular, on the creation of joint enterprises with Madagascar and the development of aquaculture.
In fact, some projects of this kind have already been conducted and simply need reinforcing.
Finally, I do hope the European Union will adopt a strict policy with regard to poaching in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar has recently signed bilateral agreements with Japan, Taiwan and Korea, the terms of which are not always entirely clear.
I therefore feel it is crucial for the European Union to keep a very close watch specifically over the implementation of the special surveillance and monitoring measures aimed at restricting poaching activities in this zone and thus to ensure that the signing of the fisheries agreement with Madagascar is genuinely and indisputably valid.
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports this proposed regulation on the renewal of the fisheries agreement with Madagascar.
We also support the excellent report by Mrs Fraga Estevez , and we ask the Council to incorporate the amendments approved by the Committee on Fisheries.
On many occasions we have complained, always justifiably, about the lack of coherence of the Commission and the Council, which sometimes verges on the arbitrary, in relation to the negotiation and signing of fisheries agreements.
It is the sector itself which suffers from this lack of direction, and it does not feel that it is supported by the Commission.
The Commission sometimes gives the impression that it wants to forget the conclusions of the Luxembourg Council of October 1997 on the policy of fisheries agreements with third countries, which explicitly recognised the socio-economic advantages of those agreements for the Community, both in terms of the supply of raw materials and employment, and which are - and will continue to be - an essential element of the common fisheries policy.
I share the concern mentioned by the rapporteur in her report relating to the fact that more than 62% of the cost of the agreement corresponds to development cooperation actions and has nothing to do with financial compensation for the agreed catches.
We are in favour of development cooperation and budgetary transparency.
These actions must therefore be financed by the European Development Fund which, to date, has financed the development of the fishing sectors of the developing countries to the not inconsiderable tune of EUR 421 million.
This agreement, like all fisheries agreements with third countries, is aimed at a specific form of fishing - in this case, tuna - clearly outside the 6-12 mile zone, and includes absolutely limited and measured annual fishing opportunities for an also limited and measured number of ships - 80.
The shipowners pay an amount per tonne - EUR 25 - which, as the rapporteur has pointed out, is something that only happens in the Southern agreements.
The shipowners are obliged, furthermore, to employ a significant number of Malagasy seamen, which is rising from 6 to 40, as has also been pointed out.
I congratulate Mrs Fraga Estevez once again on her excellent report which clearly demonstrates that, of the fisheries agreements signed by the developing countries with third countries, it is those which they sign with the European Union which achieve and guarantee a greater degree of transparency and control of fishing activities in those areas.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Mrs Fraga Estevez for a splendid piece of work in connection with the report.
Just as I said earlier in connection with Mr Gallagher' s report, those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party are concerned that, in line with developments, we allow the self-funding sector, that is to say the ship owners and fishermen, to pay a larger contribution towards those agreements from which they of course benefit most.
The fisheries agreement with Madagascar is valuable not only for the Community but also for Madagascar.
The high degree to which the Community' s fishing opportunities are exploited is impressive and worth emphasising.
I should like to support Mrs Fraga Estevez in saying that, in the funding of the fisheries agreements, a sharp and clear distinction should be made between the portion used to fund fishing opportunities and the portion used to fund development measures which, in the EU' s budget, should appear as development aid.
The agreements are exceedingly important to those regions of Europe in which fishing is the most important activity, and we are concerned here not merely with the work of the fishermen but also with associated businesses on land.
It is the EU' s responsibility to ensure that, when we conclude agreements, it is surplus resources with which we are concerned.
Matters must be arranged in such a way that local fishermen are provided with development opportunities, and that means that the EU must secure the concept of sustainability.
This agreement, like the one with Senegal, is important to the Community, partly of course in the light of the fact that the fisheries agreement with Morocco was not renewed.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Fraga Estevez, I thank you for your report on the new protocol under the fisheries agreement with Madagascar, by which we can safeguard the operation of our tuna fleet in these waters up to and including May 2004.
I am also pleased that you are able to adopt the draft.
The new Protocol refers exclusively to tuna and offers fishing opportunities for 80 vessels.
The financial contribution totals EUR 825 000.
I would like to emphasise that over 60% of this amount is allocated to specific measures and thus benefits the local fisheries sector.
These resources benefit, above all, monitoring and supervision, but also research and non-industrial fishing.
Also, this is the first time this Parliament has dealt with an agreement with an ACP state, providing for the satellite-based surveillance of all Community ships operating within the scope of this Agreement.
As regards Amendments Nos 1 and 3, I draw your attention to the interinstitutional agreements in force and most especially to the 5 July 2000 Framework Agreement between Parliament and the Commission.
In the context of this Agreement, we are complying with the demands of these amendments, which are therefore not necessary.
I cannot support Amendment No 2, as negotiations on a protocol to a fisheries agreement do not require their own new mandate.
What I have already said about Senegal applies correspondingly to Amendment No 4.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
The self-discipline of the speakers who, in contrast to their usual practice, have not wholly exhausted their speaking time, means that we have now closed the debate earlier than originally planned.
Commissioners, too, Mr Fischler, usually require more time than you, with your characteristically Austrian succinctness, have done today.
I ask for your understanding that we must now suspend the sitting.
We cannot bring the vote forward, as it is fixed in the agenda for 6.30 p.m..
I shall suspend the sitting until 6.30 p.m. and request you to reassemble punctually.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.51 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m.)
VOTE
Mr President, I did not want to draw your attention to this point before the vote, so I waited until after the vote.
I note that more than 80% of our fellow MEPs evidently had a good reason for not participating in the vote this afternoon.
So I ask myself whether I actually have a good reason for being here to vote at 6.30 pm this Thursday evening with so few Members present - about one hundred.
I am starting to wonder whether this is indeed wise.
Should we not join the vast majority of our colleagues who evidently had a good reason for not being here during the vote?
In other words, Mr President, I would like to ask you whether you will discuss with the presidency of the Parliament whether there would be any possibility of either considerably increasing the number of Members present at 6.30 pm on a Thursday evening or finding another solution for this Thursday evening that does not entail a vote.
Mr President, I would just like to tell Mr Blokland that it is not those who are absent who are in the right, but those who are present, and those who are not here should be ashamed of themselves.
I take the view that we should be proud of doing our duty.
We must, though, also be quite clear in our own minds that it is important to reintroduce Friday so that Thursday is made a correspondingly more attractive proposition.
Explanations of vote
Adam Report (A5-0340/2001)
.
The British Labour MEPs have voted in favour of a sheep premium of EUR 25, an increase of 20% on the figure proposed by the Commission.
Our objective was to pass on to sheep (and goat) farmers an increase in the annual premium but to keep within the expenditure limits set out in Agenda 2000 and keep us on track for CAP reform.
The incomes of sheep farmers have not kept pace with other types of farming.
This decision will help to correct the imbalance.
Because the payment will be annual and known in advance, it will help farmers in their business planning.
We particularly emphasise the importance we place on increased marketing support to encourage consumption and we look to the Commission to act with urgency.
- (FR) It seems to us that the Adams report on the proposed reform in the sheepmeat and goatmeat production sector does not take account of the basic problems facing small-scale farmers, who have the lowest incomes in Europe.
We would be happy to present the point of view of the Confédération paysanne, the French farm workers' confederation, which is protesting at the fact that the income of French sheep farmers is 45% lower than the average farm income and believes that 'at European level, the COM (common organisation of the market) in sheepmeat has not fulfilled its role, which was to guarantee the producers an income,' and that the proposed reform 'shows no signs of any political ambition to give new impetus to the sheepmeat sector.'
Allocating flat-rate aid per head of sheep and goats instead of the present system of compensatory payments is harmful to small-scale stockbreeders and in no way improves their incomes.
That is why we abstained in the vote on this report.
We are critical of Mr Adam' s report on the common organisation of the market in sheep meat and goat meat.
In our view, the amendments tabled generally represent an antiquated agricultural policy which does not correspond to the conditions and needs of modern, global society.
Against that background and with an eye to the impending general review of the EU' s agricultural policy, we have chosen to vote against the report in its entirety.
Lannoye Report (A5-0334/2001)
.
(PT) The European Union must use its development cooperation policy to strengthen the objectives designed for cooperation with developing countries in the fisheries sector by means of more programmes, technical resources and budgets under the various frameworks for priority action. This will enable us to help the economic and social development of these countries, specifically in the fields of rural development, transport, health, education and the fight against poverty.
The European Union must promote scientific research into resources and could support the implementation of an effective programme for monitoring the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of developing countries.
That concludes the vote.
Adjournment of the session
I declare this session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 6.47 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 25 October 2001.
Announcement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, since our last session, Spain has once again, unfortunately, been cruelly struck by terrorism.
On 7 November, José María Lidón Corbi, a judge and professor of law in the Basque region, was murdered in a cowardly attack whilst leaving his home in Getxo.
The previous day in Madrid, terrorists set off a car bomb, in which a hundred or so people were injured.
On my own behalf, and on that of the European Parliament, I immediately sent my deepest condolences to the victim' s family and our best wishes for a speedy recovery to everyone who was injured in this attack.
Yet again, ETA terrorists have shown that they deny the right to life, that they reject the very principle of the rule of law.
By attacking a judge this time, the terrorists are demonstrating this once more.
Yesterday, Algeria was struck by catastrophic weather conditions, which so far have claimed 538 lives and left 316 injured.
I immediately expressed our deep sorrow to the Algerian people for the disaster that has struck Algiers, and our total solidarity for the human tragedy that the country is suffering.
I also asked President Bouteflika to pass on a message on our behalf to express our deepest sympathy to the victims' families and loved-ones.
I hope very much that the European Union will play an active part in supplying emergency aid, which must be sent as soon as possible.
Yesterday, three journalists were killed in an ambush by the Taliban in Afghanistan.
Johanne Sutton, Pierre Billaud and Volker Handloik died whilst carrying out their profession, which was also their passion.
It was because of their courage that each of us was able to keep abreast of the events in Afghanistan.
I would like to pay homage to them and to express our deepest sympathy for their families and colleagues.
This afternoon, less than an hour ago, an American aircraft crashed not far from JFK airport in the Queens area of New York.
There were more than 260 passengers and crew members on board.
For the time being, we do not know the exact number of casualties or the precise circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you to observe a minute' s silence to pay homage to all the victims.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Zimeray who travelled to Vientiane as soon as we had the opportunity to contact him, which was 10 days after we were imprisoned. He immediately offered to act in our defence, and informed us of the diplomatic steps that you had promptly taken.
He also told us what many of our fellow Members had done to help us, particularly Mr Brok and our colleagues and friends in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and many other Members as well.
Madam President, I would like to give my sincere thanks to you and all the Members, such as Ignacio Salafranca, Jules Maaten and many others.
I think that we should pursue this initiative and I see that this issue is also on the agenda of this session.
The situation in Laos is tragic.
I would like to reiterate to all my fellow Members that we were in Laos to fight the cause of five lost prisoners, known as the desaparecidos, but there are hundreds of other prisoners and the prison conditions in Laos are terrible.
These people do not even have the right to a fair trial, they are passing their final days in oblivion without even being able to see their family. Unfortunately, this situation is nothing out of the ordinary.
Corruption is endemic in Laos.
I hope that we will have the opportunity to work together in order to change this situation as quickly as possible.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of Thursday 25 October have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr Ferber, we shall take note of this.
If I am not mistaken, during voting time on Thursday 25 October, my vote by roll call on the second part of Amendment No 559 on the budget, and more specifically on premiums for tobacco, has been incorrectly recorded.
I voted against the second part, against the commentary, and I am shown in the register as having voted in favour.
I sent you a note and I received confirmation from Parliament' s services that this will be corrected.
As far as I know, this has not yet been done.
I hope that this will be corrected, but I wanted to mention this to the House as well.
Certainly, Mr Korakas. Thank you.
(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)
Order of business
The next item is the final draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.
Sittings of 12 to 15 November in Strasbourg Regarding Tuesday
Madam President, my report on passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterway has been placed on Tuesday' s agenda under item No 16.
In recent months, different groups have continuously called for either bringing the discussion forward or postponing it.
Last week, I was informed that three of the groups, PSE, PPE-DE and the Verts/ALE, were in favour of postponing the discussion.
I then agreed to this on the assumption that the other groups needed more time for a fully-fledged discussion.
When on Thursday evening, much to my surprise, I heard that the Conference of Presidents had decided to go ahead with the discussion after all, I informed all Members that I was still prepared to postpone the debate.
It since transpired on Thursday afternoon that the PPE-DE Group had not been in favour of postponement and that it is no longer an issue for the PSE Group either.
Furthermore, the agendas of the two remaining plenary part-sessions of this year are already full.
Now that I have found this out, I am withdrawing my offer which I made in writing and circulated and I assume that the debate will go ahead tomorrow.
Of course!
Regarding Wednesday President.
I have received a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to postpone Mr Fiori' s report until the Brussels session of 28 and 29 November.
Is there a Member who wishes to move this request?
Madam President, Parliament must be an open forum whose business people are able to follow.
That is something Parliament will not be if we debate the Fiori report this week, because it is only today that it has become available in ten languages. I do not know what the situation is regarding the eleventh language, Danish.
According to our original timetable, to which the Conference of Presidents had agreed, it was to be debated during the November II part-session.
Nor do we think there is any reason for debating it before the Caudron report.
I would therefore ask, on behalf of the Liberal Group, that we move it to the November II part-session.
I believe it is only right that you should check up on how the groups vote.
On this point, as on many others, the groups are extremely divided. The main thing, however, is that the world outside should be able to follow what is happening.
We MEPs should also be able to form views on the extremely difficult issues discussed in this report.
Mrs Thors, I can give you an explanation which may not have been brought to Members' attention. The Conference of Presidents decided to put the debate on the Fiori report on the agenda at the same time as the debate on Mr Caudron' s report.
With regard to the vote, it was decided that if there was insufficient time, Mr Fiori' s report could be put to the vote at the second November session in Brussels.
I am simply giving you this information so that you are aware.
If the report is kept on the agenda, I will see whether or not we have sufficient time to take the vote.
We have just heard the speaker who moved the request.
Is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of the request?
Madam President, I would like to speak in favour of this request because, although, admittedly, only a small majority in the Conference of Presidents decided on Thursday to submit these two reports to a joint debate, it is certainly not straightforward for Parliament to allow the administrative services to take a decision that is political in nature.
In other words, this is a difficult requirement to meet.
We must not rush the vote on the Fiori report nor must we rush the debate.
However, if we set a deadline for tabling amendments for 9 p.m. on Tuesday and expect the administrative services to work like Trojans so that the Rules of Procedure are observed and Members have the documents 24 hours before the vote, we would be racing against time and this would not do credit to the Fiori report or to Parliament.
That is why we must support - and this is something that I support, along with my fellow Members from the radical group - the joint proposal to postpone the debate, so that we do not have to deal with this in a hurry.
Madam President, taking the language question first, I am informed that everything is in order so far and available in all languages.
I will now turn to the esteemed Mr Dell'Alba's comments and start by agreeing with him that this is a political issue, but then coming to a quite different conclusion.
This is not only a political issue but also an ethical one, and of the greatest significance for the Fiori report.
It had always been our opinion that the Fiori report should be considered together with both the Caudron reports.
As we have just decided, Madam President, to begin the debate with the Commission and the Council at three o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, there will be sufficient time in the morning to debate the Fiori report and the two Caudron reports.
If that were not the case, then we too would have doubts about proceeding with everything on the agenda as it stands.
Now, though, that the debate with the Council and the Commission on the international situation is to take place on Wednesday afternoon, we take the view that the Caudron and Fiori reports belong together.
It is, though, an ethical and a political issue requiring an answer now, and so we would be very grateful if it could remain on the agenda.
So, we have heard the speaker who moved the request, one speaker in favour and one speaker against the request.
Mr Barón Crespo, do you wish to take the floor again?
Madam President, I would like to point out that I have the right to speak, for my esteemed fellow Member Mr Poettering did not only talk about the Fiori report: he spoke about the whole of Wednesday' s agenda, and as proposer, I feel that I have the right to speak, because it was my group that put forward the proposal to once again include in the agenda for Wednesday morning the oral questions that were initially put to the Council on a subject that is so important, especially if we consider the free time that we - according to what we are led to believe - have available.
I would like to take the opportunity, Madam President, to protest strongly and ask that you, yourself, do the same before the Council, for the representative of the Council, in the Conference of Presidents, gave a piece of information which I understand to be inaccurate, if not completely untrue, in relation to Council meetings.
Justice and Home Affairs Council is going to meet, as expected, on Friday, yet the representative of the Council at the Conference of Presidents said that the meeting would be taking place on 7 December.
This information is misleading, particularly at a time when Parliament is making a substantial effort to proceed with the emergency procedure on anti-terrorist legislation, and I think it was a serious mistake, because it has led to confusion that has had a negative effect on everyone concerned.
Firstly, in relation to this apparently empty Wednesday morning agenda, according to Mr Poettering.
Secondly, Madam President, I think it is a major political mistake to subordinate a legislative report such as the Caudron report to a question that will have ethical repercussions for all - not only for one particular political group - for we need to be working on that which is relevant to us all: the draft legislation.
Furthermore, as anticipated, we can remain perfectly calm and still have the time needed to deal with matters as serious as those set out in the Fiori report without necessarily having to resort to the emergency procedure.
We therefore agree that the matter should be debated in the November II part-session, as had initially been planned.
Mr Barón Crespo, everything is, in fact, perfectly in order, since there were two speakers to move this request.
Therefore, we were permitted to hear two speakers who are in favour and, in order to be fair, I shall now give the floor to Mr Lannoye, who I believe is going to speak against.
Madam President, unlike Mr Barón Crespo, I think that the debate on the Fiori report depends on the Caudron report. I shall explain why.
We set up a temporary committee to deal with the subject of human genetics. Why did we do this?
Because there are considerable ethical problems and I believe that everyone is aware of what they are.
In my view, we cannot express a sound opinion on research programmes lasting several years, whose ethical aspects are fundamental, and then suddenly vote on the Fiori report which could lose a significant amount of its political impact.
I therefore believe that, in order to make the work of Parliament more coherent, it would be better to take the vote on the Fiori report at the same time as the Caudron report.
That said, I also agree that if the physical conditions are not appropriate, it is better to postpone the vote than to proceed under the wrong circumstances.
I think that we must respect Members.
I shall therefore put to the vote the request by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to postpone the Fiori report.
(Parliament gave its assent)
I have received a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to bring forward to this week the debate on criminal sanctions and Community law, which is currently scheduled for Wednesday 28 November.
Justice and Home Affairs. Madam President, on behalf of the committee I have the honour to chair, I would ask that this topic be reinserted on this week's agenda, since, contrary to the advice given to the Conference of Presidents last week, the Justice and Home Affairs Council will be discussing it at its meeting this Friday.
This evening the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs will adopt a text, drafted in cooperation with the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which we believe is a strong basis for a Parliament resolution on this matter.
If it is not possible to have a debate in plenary with the Council, we request authorisation to submit this text to the plenary in the form of a draft recommendation for a vote on Thursday, pursuant to Article 39 of the Treaty and Rule 94 of our Rules of Procedure.
Madam President, after listening to the explanation given by Mr Watson, whom I would like to wish a long presidency of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, for he does this job so well, my group withdraws its proposal and adopts the one tabled by Mr Watson.
Are there any objections to Mr Watson' s proposal?
(Parliament gave its assent)
Regarding Thursday
President.
I suggest that, in view of the busy voting schedule at midday, the start of voting time be brought forward by half an hour, in other words, that we begin voting at 11.30 a.m.
Even without the vote on the report by Mr Fiori, I think that this is necessary.
With regard to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance, I have received a request from the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left to add a fourth sub-item entitled 'Floods in Algeria' .
I suggest that we add this item to item three, 'Effects of hurricane Michelle in Nicaragua and Cuba' , and we call this item 'Natural disasters' .
Madam President, if it is at all possible, I would like to add an oral amendment: 'on the effects of hurricane Michelle on Nicaragua, Cuba and Honduras' , which is where it has caused the most damage.
Of course.
I do not think that there will be any objections to this and we can therefore proceed in this way.
(Parliament gave its assent) The order of business is thus established.
Speeches on points of order
Madam President, according to the British press today six Algerian nationals were arrested over the weekend by the French security services.
They are allegedly associated with the terrorist group al-Qa'ida and with the five people arrested last year found in possession of maps which marked out the Parliament buildings in Strasbourg and the Cathedral.
Given the proximity both in place and time to our current part-session, what information does the President have on their hostile intentions towards Parliament?
Given the current climate of suspicion, with another crash in New York of an airliner this evening, what additional security measures will be taken to protect us?
I, for instance, was allowed into Parliament this evening without even showing my security pass.
What measures can be taken to protect us, given this danger?
Mr Tannock, as you can imagine, I carried out a very thorough investigation into the report you mentioned.
I was told that the plans the terrorists had in their possession related only to Strasbourg cathedral and the Christmas market.
But, of course, this information gives us reason to be even more careful, and I shall now give the floor to Mr Balfe, who will give you more details on what has been done to step up security.
Madam President, I have no more information than you on this series of arrests.
No-one has informed me about it but I am sure that will happen in the course of the evening and I will then tell Mr Tannock.
I should like to point out, though, that whilst we welcome the new security on the periphery, this building has to operate in the interests of Members.
I hope that the Bureau will reconsider the question of security and try to fine-tune it somewhat, because far too many Members are having their visitors and other groups seriously inconvenienced by the way the rules are being applied.
They can be applied a little more subtly.
I hope we can do that.
As regards Mr Tannock's question, I will find out what I can and inform him and the House.
In any case, I believe Mr Tannock welcomes the security measures that the Bureau thought it was necessary to take.
I can inform you that many Members submitted this question.
We cannot be too careful at the moment, which is, admittedly, an extremely testing time.
Madam President, I would like to briefly draw attention to the case of one of our colleagues in Israel, Mr Bichara, whose parliamentary immunity has recently been waived by the Knesset, a step that was taken because Mr Bichara expressed his political views in public.
I think that this step goes completely against the concept of parliamentary immunity, as this is never used by a country to punish MPs for expressing political views.
I believe that Mr Bichara has an extremely important role to play in relations between the Israeli and Palestinian people and in bringing about a fair solution to this conflict.
I also think that it is important that you bring up this matter with the Israeli authorities and express Parliament' s concern at this step which infringes freedoms and breaches the treaty signed by Israel and the European Union.
We shall look into this matter very carefully.
Thank you, Madam President, for your words of solidarity for Algeria at the beginning of the sitting.
It is said that you find out who your true friends are in times of need and I believe, in fact, that now is the time to show our alliance with the Algerian people by providing substantial emergency aid of various kinds to help them contend with the extensive damage caused by the torrential rain that has struck Algiers and northern Algeria.
A natural disaster of this kind is always a huge blow for any population, particularly the most deprived, but, in this case, Algeria is also a country that has already suffered so much due to Islamic terrorism, economic and political crises, which continue to dash everyone' s hopes.
My group is, therefore, calling on the European Union to make the necessary resources available to help those affected by the disaster and, secondly, we believe that we must draw lessons, and not only in conjunction with the authorities and Parliament, but also with the relevant representatives of civil society in Algeria, from this tragedy and define priorities for our future cooperation.
If I may, Madam President, I would like to briefly give some information about another subject, since the request to add this item to the topical and urgent debate was rejected, that of the case of Leïla Zana.
The Bureau of my group recently held a meeting in Ankara.
We requested the opportunity to meet the Sakharov Prize winner, of course, but we were refused outright, and what we find particularly disappointing, especially since this concerns the Sakharov Prize, is that we were unable, at a time when we are combating terrorism, to meet Leïla Zana.
I think that it was only fair that my fellow Members are given this information and I also hope that the Commission is aware of this information since the Commission is currently drafting a progress report on relations between Turkey and the European Union.
Madam President, while Mr Dupuis was held in Laos last week, a large number of your colleagues, including myself, were detained in Brussels airport for eight hours, from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m., because the government of Belgium would not ensure the free movement of European citizens around Europe, including that of MEPs.
We could not get out of Brussels at all; we had to go back, and in the end departed from Charleroi the next day.
It took me 23 hours to get home.
Could you make representations to the Belgian Government, and to other governments, for that matter, to the effect that all European citizens, not just MEPs, should be entitled to free movement in Europe and that unjustified and illegal blockades of airports should be dealt with by the authorities in the proper manner?
Of course, Mr Purvis, I will certainly do this.
Madam President, I would like to inform you that in July this year, in accordance with Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union, I tabled a question to the Council of Ministers with regard to the Sahara referendum and also to some statements made by Mr Solana, the European Union' s representative for Foreign Policy.
A few weeks ago some EU Member States in the United Nations debated the common EU position on the Sahara.
Curiously, France distanced herself from the Belgian presidency' s proposal and demanded that the line be adopted as set out in the response that the Council of the European Union gave me personally on 10 October.
To date, I have received no such response.
There was even talk of a diplomatic incident, of a crisis between Spain and France, and between Spain and Morocco.
I would like to say two things for the record: firstly, it has never been my intention to create a diplomatic incident between Spain and France, nor between Spain and Morocco.
And secondly, I would like to express my concern at the lack of transparency shown by the Council to this Parliament, for I have had no official answer to my question.
Madam President, you will know that the City of Strasbourg is twinned with the City of Leicester, my home city.
The Lord Mayor of Leicester, Councillor John Allen and the Lady Mayoress, Mrs Allan, are in the public gallery.
This twinning is an important political and social union and I very much hope you will welcome the Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress here in Strasbourg.
Madam President, I rise to draw your attention to a report broadcast by the BBC last week, about child trafficking between European Union countries and West Africa.
This was a most disturbing report and I will send it to your services.
On behalf of colleagues in this House who I know are very concerned about these issues, I ask that you raise this subject with the Commission and the Member States and ask whether action can be taken across the European Union to stamp out this appalling abuse of young people from a very deprived part of the world.
Madam President, I should like once again to condemn the barbaric bombings which have been killing civilians and even destroying hospitals for days, or rather weeks now.
Bombings which, unfortunately, have the support of our countries' governments.
Statements by the US leadership that the objective of the attack is not Bin Laden but to break up Al-Qaeda, even though no one knows where it is, and that it is now the turn of other countries are particularly worrying and reveal the real purpose of the USA, proving that the attack on 11 September is merely being used as a pretext for pushing ahead with previous plans to gain control of this extremely important area and use up stocks of weapons.
On the other hand, grass-root reaction is increasing both here and in the USA, with the people calling for this barbaric attack to stop at once and for our countries and governments to call off their plan to send troops to Afghanistan.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece support these movements, heart and soul, and trust that they will become even stronger and put a stop to the crime which is being committed.
Mr President, I would like to intervene to say that the television system here still does not receive images or sound from Finland.
Since the beginning of September, we have intervened in this matter on four separate occasions: first orally, then by e-mail, following which all the Finnish Members signed and dispatched a letter to the Quaestors on 2 October; finally, I raised the matter once again during the first session in October.
None of these requests has obtained any response whatsoever.
We may as well be talking to Siberia.
Finland is, technologically, at the top of the league; and we are ashamed of such behaviour.
I am asking you to intervene promptly in this matter, since so much is going on in the world that this sole Member State which is left outside the information loop needs to be included without delay.
I must say that I, myself, am very surprised.
I certainly recall what the Finnish Members said on this subject and I thought that the problem had been resolved long ago.
In any case, you can rely on me to remind the Quaestors of this, although I cannot see any of the Quaestors in the Chamber at the moment, because I believe that this is a very important issue and that we really must ensure that this is working as soon as possible.
Madam President, as has already been mentioned, this week is certainly not a normal plenary part-session.
For two months, this thing we call war has been in progress, a terrible war against terrorism. This very morning, Italy' s military involvement and its support for the United States have taken on a practical form, for indeed, today, Italian troops are leaving to go and help the United States and all the European Union troops which are actively, practically engaged in the war against this barbaric civilisation.
Well then, in the light of this development, to which we must certainly not become used or accustomed, the debate on the agenda, a Commission communication scheduled for Wednesday, seems decidedly inadequate.
Madam President, I expected something more!
I do not know what is happening to the Members, but when I go home I am surrounded by European citizens, my fellow citizens, all asking me the same thing: "What is your view of these events down at the European Parliament?
What can you say to reassure us and allay our concerns?"
Well then, I am frankly disappointed by the presence, with all due respect to her, of the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister, Mrs Durant, whose remit is transport, not war, and though she will, I am sure, have a dramatic speech from the Presidency to read out to us.
I feel that it is almost an affront to Parliament that the Belgian Prime Minister is not going to be here at this important time.
Moreover, I would ask you, Madam President, to see whether it would be possible for Mr Solana to be present here too, for he is our foreign policy representative and it is his duty, or rather his obligation, to provide us with clear, practical, specific information.
We cannot be content with just another declaration of good intentions or the assumption of a political position.
We are at war, but some people appear not yet to have understood the full implications of that fact or the importance of the present time.
To give practical effect to this speech, then, I call upon Mr Solana to come to Parliament and tell us clearly what is happening in Afghanistan so that we know not just the details of the military operations but also the extent of our combined endeavours in the field of humanitarian aid to help the communities affected.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we were extremely worried to hear that the government of the United Kingdom is pushing through an emergency bill allowing terrorist suspects to be held indefinitely.
We also hear that it intends to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights, which bans detention without trial.
This development, coupled with the recent anti-terrorist law passed by the US Congress, which also grants extensive detention rights, and plans for the European Union (arrest warrant, definition of terrorism, reinforced police collaboration) is a highly dangerous development.
Unfortunately, it confirms our reading that the appalling attack on 11 September is being used by the imperialist powers not just to settle international accounts but also to defeat the enemy within, by eroding individual and collective rights.
However, it is encouraging that the American Civil Liberties Union and numerous American, British and other human rights organisations have condemned this action outright.
In fact, only grass-roots reaction, only a united grass-roots movement can bring about the repeal of such laws and prevent them from spreading throughout the continent of Europe.
Madam President, on a point of order. It would be a pity if no Member from the United Kingdom were to stand up and say to Mr Alyssandrakis that we are also deeply concerned at this proposal and we hope it will not go through unchallenged.
Madam President, since you have announced that the votes will start at 11.30 a.m. on Thursday, could you tell me what will happen to my report on the European Year of People with Disabilities?
It would be very wrong if a report dealing with disabled people's rights were put back to Thursday afternoon when most of the Members are not here and most of the Members will not be here to vote.
We are very remiss about disabled people's rights in this Parliament in terms of access.
It would demonstrate a great lack of awareness of the problems that disabled people face if we do not give them some degree of respect by scheduling this debate at a time when Members will be present to debate and vote on this important issue.
Mrs Lynne, of course I understand what you are saying, but in any case, and you are well aware of this, it is not because we are bringing voting time forward by half an hour that your report cannot be dealt with in the morning.
If you look at the agenda, which I have before me now, you will see that before your report, we are due to have a statement by the Council and the Commission on the economic and employment situation, and deal with the Figueiredo report and the Bouwman report.
It is obvious that, with all these items on the agenda, we would not, in any case, have been able to finish dealing with your report between 10 a.m. and 12 noon.
I am extremely sorry about this, but I think that you are quite right to highlight the problem.
Public access to Parliament documents
The next item is the report (A5-0349/2001) by Mrs Maij-Weggen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the adaptation of the European Parliament' s Rules of Procedure to the Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding public access to documents of the European Parliament, Council and Commission (2001/2135(REG)).
.
(NL) Madam President, this week marks the provisional end of the discussion on the 'public access to Parliament documents' Regulation.
Technically, this Regulation is entitled 'access to documents' , but it ended up with a different name in the vernacular.
In May, after months of negotiations with the Council and Commission, we were able to bring the Regulation to a successful end.
This was an important moment for me personally, because I have fought for more transparency in the European Union for years.
According to the Resolution, each of the institutions, namely the Commission, the Council and Parliament, must ensure that the Regulation has been incorporated in the institutions' own rules of procedure, work instructions and meeting procedures by 3 December.
For our Parliament, this meant that we needed to check out our Rules of Procedure to establish whether more improvements were needed.
We often feel that the Commission and the Council fail to come up to the mark in this area, but we have noted that there is room for improvement in one or two areas in our Rules of Procedures too.
When I use the word 'we' , I would like to make it clear that I also want to include my fellow rapporteur, Mr Cashman, with whom I have worked closely.
The assessment was made in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but also in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
That is logical because both committees had worked together before.
I thank Mr Cashman very much for the constructive manner in which we have always managed to enter into consultation.
So what are the proposed changes to our Rules of Procedure for which we are asking your backing?
First of all, what matters is the right of all citizens in the European Union, in other words, including those of third countries, to access EP documents.
That right may have been in place for European citizens, but this was not the case for citizens from third countries registered in the EU.
On that score, therefore, we need to broaden the scope.
Moreover, this corresponds to the 'Freedom of Information Act' of the United States.
We are therefore not doing anything out of the ordinary.
Secondly, the definition of documents which are eligible for access must, according to the Regulation, be widened compared to the current Rules of Procedure.
It should include all parliamentary documents, including the preparatory documents, such as working documents by rapporteurs or by parliamentary delegations.
There is no need to include MEPs' personal correspondence or the groups' internal documents, because these are not official parliamentary documents.
The European Court of Justice has made statements to this effect, which we should, and want to, observe, of course.
The third requirement in the Regulation for which our Rules of Procedure do not provide, is the requirement to register all public documents and to include all documents by name and number in this registration.
Furthermore, this registration must be available and accessible on the Internet.
That will require the necessary efforts to be made and that is why the institutions have until June to achieve this.
We must wish our team and the deputy Secretary-General all the best for this task, for it is quite a job to organise the whole system.
We will have a look in June to see whether everything has turned out well.
A fourth requirement for which our present Parliament does not provide, is access to the Minutes of the Parliament' s Bureau.
That cannot be such a big problem because these Minutes become public after a certain time anyway.
The only difference is that our Rules of Procedure did not make it compulsory before, and now this obligation has to be stipulated in the Rules of Procedure.
In fact, my advice would be to publish those Minutes even earlier than is now the case.
After all, our entire Parliament knows what is being discussed the afternoon after the meeting anyway.
Fifthly, we still maintain the system of closed meetings in our Parliament when delicate matters are discussed.
Our proposal is to leave those meetings in camera, but to verify the Minutes against Articles 4 and 9 of the Regulation.
Anything which does not fall within this must be made public via the Minutes.
I hope that this could persuade the committees not to have the meetings declared closed unnecessarily.
The final point concerns the conciliation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament in the event of disputes.
Parliament must be involved in the conciliation, and it appears to us to be the best solution if a Vice-President of the European Parliament were to be appointed especially for this purpose.
We would also like to see this laid down in the Rules of Procedure so that it is clear who is responsible.
This concludes the most important changes to our Rules of Procedure.
At the final vote, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs backed these amendments by a large majority.
There are not that many and I therefore believe that we can bring this to a good conclusion here as well.
Four additional amendments have been tabled, including one by my group and three by the Greens.
I do not have much of a problem with that of my group, but we should take another good look at those by the Greens, for it makes no sense to go beyond what is stipulated in the Regulation.
As we should have dealt with this when we were discussing the Regulation, I am tempted to say no to these amendments.
On a final note, this Regulation and change to our Rules of Procedure are very important because they grant our citizens more access to internal documents of our Parliament and of the entire European Union, which improves transparency.
Public confidence, which is very much needed, will also increase as a result.
I welcome this and that is why I hope that we can approve these Rules of Procedure on Tuesday.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Maij-Weggen for her comments.
I have heartily enjoyed the way we have worked together on this and I am pleased to say that the work in her report represents our joint work.
I also accept what she has said on the amendments.
Before I speak further, I should like the services to rule whether Amendment No 17 from the Green Group is admissible, because it seeks to rewrite the regulation.
It calls on Parliament to adopt criteria for the definition of sensitive information and documents.
Now the definition of sensitive documents is contained in the regulation, Article 9, reference to Article 4(1)(a).
I should again like to thank Mrs Maij-Weggen for her consistent approach to transparency and openness.
It is absolutely right that we adopt changes to our Rules of Procedure so that we not only conform to the regulation on access to documents but can also begin to be held accountable by the citizens whom we purport to represent.
Therefore, now that Commissioner Barnier is here, it is important for me to refer to some of my concerns about the entry into force of this regulation on 3 December 2001.
When the regulation enters into force, the citizen's right of access to institution documents will no longer be a discretionary concession but a fundamental right, rooted in Article 255.
As no other legal basis on access to documents is provided in the Treaty, the regulation on Article 255 will be the framework for all other secondary legislation and for the internal rules of the institutions, which should be in conformity with it.
The Commission, therefore, has the responsibility to present formal proposals to repeal or amend secondary legislation which is not coherent with the principles and limits defined in Article 18(3) of the regulation.
This is extremely important if we are to bring this regulation into force.
Similarly, on the wider definition of institutions and the bodies and agencies, the Commission is mandated by Recital 8 and by the joint statement to review the rules of agencies and, where necessary to propose amendments as soon as possible.
On the matter of the Interinstitutional Committee - and all of these points are relevant if we are ourselves adopting changes to the Rules of Procedure - the Council presidency has said that it believes the Interinstitutional Committee should operate at secretary-general level.
This differs from the opinion of President Prodi and of Parliament.
Though I hesitate to say this, it is nonsense to suggest that secretaries-general should sit in this Interinstitutional Committee.
The whole point of political presence is political accountability.
Finally, Mrs Maij-Weggen has done an excellent job on this and now is the time for the Commission to ensure that the Treaty is respected and that the regulations flowing therefrom are brought before Parliament.
Mr President, the report we are debating this afternoon in Parliament is important, because it relates to something we have always defended in this House: the principle of transparency, which means citizens' right to access documents and also the principles of openness and proximity to these very citizens.
For this reason, we are debating Article 255 of the Treaty as reformulated in Amsterdam, and also an important article of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, Article 42.
After the agreement reached by the Council and Parliament, we need to incorporate the principles promoted by the aforementioned Articles of the Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights respectively into the Rules of Procedure of this House.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Maij-Weggen most sincerely on her excellent work; her report, in addition to the amendments she tabled, was adopted in committee with 25 votes in favour to one against.
I would also like to congratulate Mr Cashman.
I think that a good relationship was maintained between all those involved, and I also believe that all of the proposals tabled by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs have been taken into consideration by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
Therefore, Mr President, in the vote that is going to take place tomorrow we shall be transposing a political principle of fundamental importance and incorporating it into our Rules of Procedure.
In doing so, we will be including a fundamental principle in the interests of the aforementioned transparency and openness into the set of rules that regulates our relations.
Mr President, my group is going to support an amendment it has itself tabled, not by pure chance, but because it is a good amendment.
Furthermore, we will support Mrs Maij-Weggen' s proposals.
I trust that the result of the vote will be sufficient, that is to say, more than 314 votes, for these proposals to be incorporated into the Rules of Procedure of this House.
On behalf of the European People' s Party, I would like to once again congratulate the two rapporteurs for the great work they have done.
Mr President, what is transparency?
Transparency is guaranteed, or so one might and should argue, when as many of the European institutions' documents as possible are made accessible to all citizens of the EU with an interest in them and also when meetings of the Council are guaranteed to be open to the public.
It is to this banal sentence that we can reduce the foundation document of the European Transparency Initiative, called into being by a very wide range of parliamentarians and people in public life across Europe and only now beginning to become effective on the basis of Regulation 1049/2001 and the adjustments which we in this Parliament are now making to it.
There are still different conceptions of what we want transparency to be like.
I, myself, want the European transparency formula to be an American-Swedish hybrid, with unlimited access to almost everything, with not even a registry, and with a real possibility of watching over and permanently examining what we do in Parliament, and especially what is done in the Council, where the really important decisions are taken.
This Parliament does not yet, unfortunately, have the majority required for this.
It can be argued that the European public, in all its diversity, is far from ready.
There is also room for the argument that, if an Italian or Austrian citizen writes to one of the EU institutions, and his letter is promptly recorded in a public registry, he would certainly not have reckoned with that and might react differently from a Swede, who would treat it as a matter of course.
I think we must, in any case, carry on along this road, especially now that events around the world make the definition of European values an issue.
Transparency is definitely one of them.
What we now have in front of us is a step in this direction.
Mention has already been made of the deliberations in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
I would like the Greens to come up with a substantially clearer explanation of Amendment No 15 than has been produced to date.
I would personally have no problem whatever with the production of necessary documents in the context of budgetary control, or indeed with what is demanded at the end.
But if it only scores an own goal, it would be better to leave it out.
Mr Cashman has already said all that needs to be said about Amendment No 17.
Amendment No 14 meets with our group's undivided approval.
It represents an improvement.
Even the deletion of the restriction to 'permanent' committees in the first part of Amendment No 15 is only to be welcomed.
We must all be aware that there can be no democracy without transparency.
We still have plenty of work to do before that is achieved.
Mr President, as has been pointed out, this report is, of course, a consequence of the quite arduous work done on the report on Article 255 of the EC Treaty, which concerns public access to documents and on which we voted on 3 May.
Thanks to the extremely strong alliance for transparency which existed, and still exists, in Parliament and in which Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman have played a significant role, we finally succeeded in getting the Council and the Commission to endorse a proposal reflecting this House' s desire for as much transparency as possible.
The legislation we adopted is deficient and unclear in certain respects but constitutes a first and very important step forwards in the fight for greater transparency in the EU' s work on behalf of its citizens.
We also decided to review the regulations by January 2004 at the latest.
In the same way as we did then, we must now take the lead in the work aimed at taking a further step forward.
Transparency and public control are the bases for a democratic form of government and a prerequisite for people' s being able to follow, and participate in, public decision-making.
The opportunity to access EU documents creates greater confidence and legitimacy, two things in short supply in the EU at the present time, unfortunately.
When we adjust our regulations, let us not therefore make them too complicated.
Let us interpret Article 255 as generously as possible and the concept of a 'document' as broadly as possible.
There are exemptions in the legislation, in Article 4, but let us not leave the way open for new interpretations of secrecy or of classification of documents as top secret, and let us not construct unnecessary bureaucracies, either.
It is important for people to be able to obtain documents to which they are entitled as soon as possible, as well as for documents to be available on the Internet.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party tabled amendments along these lines in the committee, but they were not adopted.
I hope that they will nonetheless be adopted in practice.
My group supports this report because, for us, transparency and public control are efficient and democratic, not bureaucratic and unnecessary.
Through progressive and extensive regulations in Parliament governing transparency, we can show that it is we who are there for the people, and not the other way around.
Mr President, it is customary to thank rapporteurs but we genuinely want to pay tribute to Mrs Maij-Weggen for the work she has done on this.
I would like to echo what Mrs Malmström has just said about the urgency of transparency and openness, especially in Parliament and I would like to endorse Mr Cashman's remark that this must be taken as a political responsibility.
We, as elected politicians, are responsible to our electorate for ensuring that all proceedings are as open as possible.
With that in mind, I should like briefly to mention the amendments in the name of our Group.
I hope Mrs Maij-Weggen will accept the first one, extending the rules to cover all committees.
I only have limited experience of being a vice-chairman of the recent Echelon committee, but I see no reason why special committees and committees of inquiry should not be bound.
The further extension later in the amendment that broads out the range of documents from Members which count as parliamentary documents is helpful as well.
I hope that will be accepted.
On the question of political responsibility, it seems to us that for some questions the Conference of Presidents would be a better organ to decide matters than the Bureau, in the sense that in the Conference of Presidents people are representing their political party, whereas in the Bureau people are supposed to speak for the Parliament as a whole, rather than putting forward a political case.
Our third amendment suggests that we need a parliamentary definition of sensitive documents.
Mr Cashman has challenged the validity of this.
We think that within our rules, there is room for an expanded definition in relation to parliamentary documents.
We will check that and withdraw the amendment if, on reflection, we think we have gone too far.
Finally, we should like a split vote in relation to the adoption of security rules for the EP to leave out the words 'on the basis of a proposal from the Bureau' which would again push the responsibility back on to the Conference of Presidents.
However we very much appreciate the spirit in which Mrs Maij-Weggen has put this forward and we are grateful for her willingness to look carefully at our amendments.
Parliaments must be transparent.
It is very sad that the more we open our glass-houses, the less people seem to look into them.
The media need to help in this as well.
If this Parliament is to be transparent it must be reported, as well as open.
Mr President, Mrs Maij-Weggen' s report on public access to Parliament documents is an advance we cannot but support.
The problem is everything that is not included.
The main problem is that the Commission and the Council do not supply Parliament with documents from the phase during which legislation is prepared, and that is, of course, the phase in which people have an interest in participating so as to influence the content of the legislation.
Our rapporteurs and committee chairmen can often get hold of the relevant papers.
Members of the executive can, more often than not, obtain what they need from their political friends in the Commission or the Council' s delegations, but such documents are not, and will not be, available to all MEPs or to the public.
Nor does the report make any change to the disgraceful framework agreement which the majority of Parliament has entered into with the Commission and which divides MEPs into first and second class Members according to whether or not they have access to confidential information.
It might be relevant to distinguish between rapporteurs and ordinary MEPs, but the distinction is not made according to who has need of the confidential information.
It is all right to impose tough sanctions on MEPs who breach confidentiality, but it is contrary to the principle of equality, and thus unlawful, to regard committee chairmen as especially eligible, while a rapporteur with the same need does not have access in the same way.
Moreover, it is completely insane and contrary to every parliamentary tradition that Parliament' s Committee on Budgetary Control, the ombudsman and the EU' s own Court of Auditors are never in a position to check all the documents concerning the Commission' s discharge of its office.
This, too, is something which Mrs Maij-Weggen' s otherwise quite excellent report does nothing about.
Nor are those of us who are to approve the enlargement agreements able to obtain the screening reports, even if they do not, in fact, contain anything other than an analysis of the gap between existing EU legislation and the candidate countries' arrangements for transposing the EU regulations into their own legislation.
This situation will scarcely be changed when the regulation regarding public access to documents comes into force.
We are still in the dark ages when it comes to transparency, but even a small step in the right direction must be endorsed, so it will be the green button I press tomorrow in order to encourage Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen to continue working for greater openness in the EU.
Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, Mrs Maij-Weggen, Mr Cashman, ladies and gentlemen, if, today, the window of the European Parliament is opened a little wider, as Mr MacCormick has put it, then Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman will have played a great part in it.
Thank you for your commitment and congratulations on the success you have achieved in making us more open.
I certainly do not see myself as groping in the dark, as Mr Bonde put it, but I do think we are on the road towards the light.
Tomorrow's resolution will also be our invitation to the citizens of the European Union to put our openness to good use, to look in on us, to, if you want to put it that way, take a look at the cards we hold, even to see behind the scenes.
Openness makes little sense, of course, if nobody is interested in the work we do.
We do not wish to complain about the lack of interest on the part of our citizens and voters, but we would like to seriously urge them to avail themselves of this new openness on the part of the European Parliament, as today's technology makes things conceivable which a few years ago would not have been possible.
With the click of a mouse, they can see the original texts we discuss in this House.
Even if press reports on Europe are sometimes incomplete, the interested citizen can nonetheless look straight in on us with the help of the Internet.
That is an opportunity, and because of it we strongly support this report.
I would have liked to say something to the representative of the Council of Ministers.
Unfortunately, he is not here, but there was not going to be much to say about transparency.
Mr. President, I also wish to congratulate Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman on this second success.
They already deserve our congratulations on their work on the original legislation, Council and Parliament Regulation 1049/2001, where their work was crucial in securing that positive result.
Now they are coming back to translate that into our Rules of Procedure to ensure that our work is transparent.
It is arguable that the European Union is in some ways already more transparent than some of our Member States.
It certainly does not reach the highest standards set by some of our Member States, but we are moving in the right direction, although of course it is still not perfect.
However we will review it in a few years in the light of experience.
Looking at the package of amendments to our Rules of Procedure tabled by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I can say on behalf of my group that we will support the thrust of what the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has put forward.
We shall listen to the arguments that are being put forward in this debate and then review our position again, but our group is leaning towards accepting Amendment No 14 from the PPE-DE Group, the first half of Amendment No 15 from the Verts/ALE Group, and possibly Amendment No 16 from the Verts/ALE Group.
We are opposed to the second half of Amendment No 15 from the Verts/ALE Group, which is entirely unworkable and would raise a number of practical problems if it were adopted.
As Mr Cashman explained, we question whether Amendment No 17 from the Verts/ALE Group it is admissible, and I welcome the fact that Mr MacCormick was doubtful about that.
I gather it may well be withdrawn and I would welcome that.
That is the position of our group, subject to the arguments we are listening to now.
However, whatever happens to those particular amendments, I am quite confident that there will be a successful outcome in the vote tomorrow.
Mr President, I add my congratulations to Mrs Maij-Weggen for an excellent report.
It is quite clear that Parliament must get its own house in order after the agreements we have had vis-à-vis the Commission.
Access is important but too much lip service is paid to access.
I thought that at the beginning Mr Corbett was being rather congratulatory.
I agree with him that we are moving in the right direction, but we still have a long way to go.
I want to bring to Parliament's attention the specific problem that the Committee on Petitions is still experiencing with access to documentation.
I know the problem here is largely the Commission, but it impacts on Parliament.
A number of European citizens have petitioned this Parliament about problems with Lloyds of London.
A very detailed questionnaire was sent to the British Government. Only Members of the Petitions Committee have been allowed to see that questionnaire; no other Members of Parliament.
Even Members of the Petitions Committee, behind closed doors, are not allowed to have any legal advisers, or political advisers, and are not allowed to take copies.
Nobody in Parliament has been allowed to see the reply from the British Government.
Mr Bolkestein said that he cannot reveal this information because it could be subject to legal action by the Commission against the British Government.
The British Government reply was that they would not let us see it because they regard it as an informal communication at the request of the Petitions Committee by the Commission.
Twenty-one detailed questions to the British Government and the British Government says that it is an informal communication!
We want some clarity here, so that we know precisely what we do and do not have access to.
At present, Members, committees and Parliament itself cannot do their jobs properly because of excessive secrecy.
I would certainly urge that a representative - the chairman of the Petitions Committee - should be on the Interinstitutional Committee so that citizens know that the Members of this Parliament who look after their interests ensure that this secrecy does not go any deeper than it does at present.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for allowing me to speak briefly on behalf of the Commission, about the work that we have done, and I am referring not only to myself and the Commission, but also to Parliament and the Presidency, to bring about the regulation of 30 May.
This is also an important time for you, because Parliament' s adoption of the report by Mrs Maij-Weggen means that as of 3 December, you will be able to apply the regulation on public access to documents.
The Commission believes that this regulation represents a very significant step forwards in achieving greater transparency and accountability on the part of the institutions towards Europe' s citizens.
The efforts made by Parliament to ensure that the regulation was adopted within the time limits imposed by the Treaty, a point that I also highlighted during a previous speech, clearly indicates the importance that your institution also attaches to transparency in general, and to the public' s right of access to documents, in particular.
You will, therefore, allow me to acknowledge and draw attention to the effort made, and to express my gratitude to the Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr Watson, but also to you, Mrs Maij-Weggen, and to Mr Cashman, who has done a great deal of work with you, Mrs Maij-Weggen, on these issues.
I would also like to tell you that the Commission is finalising a draft decision on the implementation of the regulation of 30 May.
This decision will be adopted during November by the Commission, which will annex it to its own internal Rules of Procedure.
The Commission will also be in a position, therefore, to implement this regulation within the required time limits, and this will guarantee that the public can fully exercise its right to access these documents.
In these circumstances, it is natural for the Commission to pay particular attention to the approach that the European Parliament used to amend its Rules of Procedure.
This approach will be a very useful source of inspiration for the Commission' s own internal rules, as I think it is important that the institutions follow a similar approach in applying these important rules.
The way they are applied must, of course, respect the spirit of the Rules of Procedure.
This is the main thrust of the message that the Commission wishes to give to you today, whilst we, of course, fully respect your autonomy in how you choose to amend your own rules.
In conclusion, Mr President, I would like to make a very brief comment about a point that Mrs Maij-Weggen raised in her report, which concerns the framework agreement between our two institutions, and reiterated the different nature of the two acts - firstly, the regulation of 30 May 2001 and secondly, the framework agreement that I have just mentioned.
As far as the Commission is concerned, we believe that there is no obvious incompatibility between these two documents, since Annex III of the framework agreement regulates the forwarding of confidential documents to Parliament which cannot, in any case, be forwarded to the public, due to the exceptions laid down by the regulation of 30 May.
What happens in practice should naturally reflect this legal interpretation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would, however, like to confirm the Commission' s very clear intention to faithfully apply all the provisions contained in this framework agreement.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Membership of interparliamentary delegations and joint parliamentary committees
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0346/2000) by Mr Carnero González, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the amendment of the Rules of Procedure as regards the setting-up of interparliamentary delegations and joint parliamentary committees.
Mr President, until this current parliamentary term, the standing committees, the interparliamentary delegations and the delegations of the joint parliamentary committees of this House were set up using a uniform procedure: Plenary, at the proposal of the Conference of Presidents, appointed Members, and these, at the inaugural meeting, elected the bureau for each of these bodies.
The reform of the rules introduced as a result of the decision made by this House in plenary at the end of the last parliamentary term changed this situation with regard to the interparliamentary delegations and the delegations in joint parliamentary committees.
From that point on, both were elected and set up in a different way from the standing committees: their bureaux were approved by this House, at the proposal of the Conference of Presidents, which appointed the remainder of its Members.
Proceeding in this fashion, at the start of this fifth parliamentary term, it was noticed that there was a contradiction in Rule 170.
This Rule stated that the delegations of joint parliamentary committees would be set up in the same way as the standing committees, and, at the same time, it was stated that this would be carried out in accordance with Rule 168, that had already been amended in the way I previously mentioned.
This gave rise to a contradiction, no doubt caused by an error in this House, which had adopted an oral amendment by simple majority without having removed the reference to the former procedures from the text of the Rules of Procedure.
In order to resolve this contradiction, the Conference of Presidents asked the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to look into the matter.
The report we are debating today is the result of the work carried out by this committee.
It approved this report exactly one year ago, almost unanimously.
I would point out that, for one year, this text has been 'sleeping the sleep of the just' .
The reasons for this escape me.
In any case it is clear that, during this time, the chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Napolitano, and several coordinators, insisted that it should be included on the agenda of this plenary sitting. I have the report right here.
The most important thing is that during this period there was time to be able to reflect upon the following: in the first instance, we have to remove the current contradiction in the Rules of Procedure; this is absolutely crucial if we want to prevent the same doubts we had in July 1999 arising next January.
At the same time, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs proposed in its report to return to a uniform procedure with regard to the standing committees, the interparliamentary delegations and the delegations of joint parliamentary committees.
It seems that this time used in 'sleeping the sleep of the just' with regard to this report has been of use for the parliamentary groups to consider that, although it is absolutely necessary to amend the Rules of Procedure to remove this contradiction in Rule 170, doubts still remain about the need to once again standardise the constitutional procedures of the three bodies in this Parliament that I mentioned at the start of my speech.
I am clear on several points: when dealing with a reform of the Rules of Procedure, two principles should be given priority; firstly, consensus and secondly, efficiency.
And, whilst we are talking about consensus, it is clear that your rapporteur understands the opinion of the political groups and, therefore, considers that tomorrow we should proceed to remove this contradiction in Rule 170 and leave the procedure for the setting up of interparliamentary delegations and the delegations of joint parliamentary committees as it stands at present.
The second issue is efficiency.
In January we will, once again, have to deal with a new process for setting up these bodies. This should take place quickly, so that they can continue to function as well as they have up until now.
Whilst we are on this subject, I would also like to congratulate, personally, and on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, these interparliamentary delegations and the delegations of joint parliamentary committees.
I would like, if you will allow me, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and its representatives, to insist on a third principle, coherence, which is also always of fundamental importance.
Lastly, Mr President, I would like to remind you of that old proverb which says: 'a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush' .
Let us resolve this contradiction, which is the most important thing for us to do today.
Mr President, Mr Carnero, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, am glad that the history of this legal contradiction will, it is to be hoped, come to its end for the time being when we adopt Mr Carnero's report tomorrow.
Thank you very much, Mr Carnero, for the good work you have done, and, also, for finding your way through this apparently very technical material and bringing out the political dimension to the decision we are to take.
In political terms, of course, it is a matter of some significance whether the chairpersons of the joint parliamentary committees and of the interparliamentary delegations are appointed en bloc by this, albeit rather thinned-out, House or whether every single candidate in every single joint parliamentary committee or every single interparliamentary delegation has to be elected or appointed as an individual.
It is, of course, clear that the Rules of Procedure have to provide for a process ensuring political balance in the composition of the delegations and the joint parliamentary committees.
It is likewise clear that the results of that process also have to be implemented and that this, too, can be safeguarded by the Rules of Procedure.
It is also evident, on the other hand, that these important decisions about personnel cannot be completely removed from the plenary.
We must, then, be clear in our own minds that the joint committees and interparliamentary delegations perform duties of a distinctly sensitive nature with respect to our partner countries, and also that the appointment of certain persons to chair these committees can become a political issue, may be seen as discourteous or even taken to be provocative.
It must therefore be possible for this plenary to retain control over who is actually appointed to the offices in question.
We cannot, then, have the situation in which Parliament gives, as it were, carte blanche for the appointment to specific positions, only for the individual groups, or even national delegations within them, to decide at the end of the day who is to be appointed.
Parliament must hold on to its supremacy in this respect.
I believe this also means that it must be ensured that, when we reassemble in January, we at least know the names of the people involved before proceeding to the ballot.
This was not in fact the case at the start of this Parliamentary term.
In the medium term, though, I think we must consider handing over the responsibility to the joint committees and delegations.
That is where the Members sit who know the relationships with the partner countries and their sensitive aspects.
In the long term too, they should also bear responsibility for deciding who should preside over them.
Mr President, this proposed set of amendments to our Rules of Procedure that has been so ably drafted by our rapporteur is intended to resolve a contradiction.
In one sense it is a very simple matter: we either resolve it one way or we resolve it the other way. In the view of myself and many in my group, it is not absolutely crucial whether it be resolved this way or that.
There are arguments in favour of either solution.
Some of these arguments have been put with great clarity in this short debate.
But resolved it must be, one way or the other.
As is so often the case when things are relatively simple, everybody has an opinion and these opinions do not entirely coincide.
Some people have a preference for the solution that has been put forward by the committee.
Others prefer the solution that has been tabled in an amendment signed by several political groups.
The vote tomorrow will determine which way we go.
Either way, it is crucial that we settle this tomorrow.
It needs to be sorted out before the constituent sitting in January.
I concur with our rapporteur that it is somewhat of a scandal that this report has been sat on for over a year since it was adopted in the committee and is only coming now, almost at the last minute, to plenary to be settled.
It should have been settled a long time ago.
I congratulate the rapporteur on his patience.
I am glad he was still able to remember the crucial arguments underpinning his report a whole year after he steered it through the committee.
Thank you, Mr Corbett.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Europol - joint investigation teams
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
A5-0370/2001 by Mr Turco, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on
1. the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium and the Kingdom of Sweden with a view to adopting a Council Decision extending Europol's mandate to deal with the serious forms of international crime listed in the Annex to the Europol Convention
and
2. the initiative of the Kingdom of Sweden with a view to the adoption of a Council Act amending the Council Act of 12 March 1999 adopting the rules governing the transmission of personal data by Europol to third States and third bodies
A5- 0369/2001, by Mr Kirkhope, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium, the French Republic, the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom for the adoption by the Council of a draft Framework Decision on joint investigation teams.
Mr President, Commissioner, despite the importance of the initiatives before us, the European Parliament is, on this matter, only being consulted. That means that, as often happens in these cases, the decision we take with our vote will not be taken into any account by the Council.
In spite of this, or rather, especially because of this, I want to focus on the need for urgent reform of Europol, in order to allow democratic and judicial control.
Parliament has been calling for this for at least five years, since the presentation of the Nassauer report in 1996.
The Nassauer report sent a strong political signal to the Council. It called upon the Member States not to ratify the Europol Convention until it had been placed under the control of the Court of Justice, that is, until the Court of Justice had been given the necessary decision-making authority over its interpretation and proper implementation.
Mr Nassauer' s report was exemplary in its handling of the problems encountered by Europol and the Convention, which remain the same today.
Resolution of these problems does not depend on the political groups, the rapporteur or Mr Nassauer: the judicial and democratic control of Europol is an institutional matter.
The refusal to bind up this wound inflicted on European democracy, if we can talk about the system regulating the Union' s institutions today in these terms, implies that it would be impossible to make any tangible progress in creating an area which is genuinely an area of security, of justice and of freedom but which we feel must be first and foremost an area of democracy.
Since the setting-up of Europol, the European Parliament has pointed out the need to supervise it.
The plan to increase Europol' s powers to deal with the critical situation with regard to terrorism, the scandal involving a Europol senior official and the reluctance of the national police forces to transmit their data to Europol, as well as the creation of Parlopol - a group of national and European Members of Parliament upholding the importance of increasing democratic control over Europol and its decisions within the area of justice, freedom and security - have already led the Council to reflect at least on the need to introduce some reforms.
Most importantly, the Council requested that the Commission draw up a communication on the democratic control of Europol by the end of the year.
We know the opinion of Commissioner Vitorino, who has stated many times that he considers it appropriate to set up a committee composed of members of the national and European parliaments, but we hope to hear now that the timetable for this reform will be speeded up.
We feel that, in a democratic framework, Europol should be subject to financial, budgetary and judicial control as well as democratic control.
Financial and budgetary control are currently impossible in that Europol is funded by the national States and not by the Community budget; thus Parliament and the Commission have no power of budgetary or financial control and cannot therefore either criticise or direct the activities of that body.
Judicial control has also been denied.
Indeed, the Court of Justice has been denied full powers of judicial control.
We should also note that Europol officials benefit from immunity that is so wide-ranging that it is like a guarantee of impunity, protecting them with regard to the judicial control which can be exercised at national level.
Then there is the problem of the gradual increase in the mandate and powers of Europol.
Although Europol initially dealt with drug-related crime, the act under consideration widens the powers of Europol to what is, in essence, all types of crime.
To enable the European Parliament to express its concerns and requests to the Council and the Commission at a time when they are preparing to take decisions enlarging Europol' s powers and jurisdiction, we feel that, in addition to the amendments on the two Acts proposed by Belgium and Sweden, other amendments are necessary to resolve this issue.
In our opinion, the amendments tabled may perform the function of clarifying and improving the initiatives under consideration and send the Council and the Member States a clear political message criticising the current situation and proposing several fundamental guidelines for reform.
Lastly, the combination of the factors I have mentioned and the lack of codecision powers conferred on the European Parliament with regard to justice and home affairs must prompt all those who hold dear the principles of democracy and freedom to reject the two initiatives under consideration, for I feel this would make the Council and the Member States more aware of the urgent need to reform Europol.
rapporteur.
Mr President, as you would expect, I will concentrate on my own report, which deals with the establishment of joint investigation teams.
I am very proud to be the rapporteur in an extremely innovative area, which has taken on great importance following the appalling events of 11 September.
It is perhaps all the more important because we are trying to implement Article 13 of the EU Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters which, although it was signed in May 2000, looks unlikely to be ratified for some time, making it vital that we have a legal framework in place as quickly as possible so that we can take these matters forward.
Joint investigation teams will allow two or more countries to join together for the purposes of investigating terrorism, human trafficking, drug trafficking and indeed other serious organised crime.
This is an important venture which we must all support.
A joint investigation team will take the talent and ability from different Member States and join them together for a purpose which is clearly defined and with a clear termination date, but in a way which will allow that expertise to work effectively and sharply in dealing with criminality and with bringing criminals to book.
It will be a flexible instrument and one which we have been in need of for some time.
There have been concerns expressed, although not followed up in amendments, about the extent of participation in such teams.
For instance, there have been references to the national criminal intelligence services of Member States.
As a minister responsible in the United Kingdom for setting up our own national criminal intelligence service a few years ago, I am very confident that the make-up of these organisations in Member States is already well addressed.
By giving those setting up the teams the discretion to determine their composition and to express objections when necessary, it seems to me that this point has been tackled very effectively.
Although all the States concerned are signatories to our Human Rights Convention, I have nevertheless asked in this report that we draw particular attention to the need to protect and preserve human rights in the conduct of these teams.
Terrorism is uppermost in our minds at present. But trafficking in human beings is something else we should be deeply concerned about and something which these teams could perhaps help with.
Only recently it has been revealed in the United Kingdom that there are hundreds, even thousands, of young children who have been sold into the slave trade from other parts of the world and are now in Europe suffering the most appalling treatment.
There has been a case of this nature in the UK, and there has also been a recent case in Italy.
The operation of joint investigation teams, say between Italy and ourselves, or with the participation of the French expertise in this area, would help to bring this sort of appalling offence to an end.
So the report does not concern just terrorism but these other matters too.
Indeed it may also be possible to make a significant impact on a whole complex of issues currently of topical interest comprising fraud, money laundering and economic crime of that kind, if the talents and abilities of specific small teams able to operate in different countries can be brought to bear under the control of a single operation.
There is one further point.
I have made quite clear in my report that it is important that all these operations should be under the clear parliamentary control of the European Parliament.
Within the annual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice, this particular debate should go forward as well.
We should be sure that we consider these operations carefully.
Finally, a lot of sensitive information may emerge as a result of this process.
If something akin to a select committee were perhaps to be established to receive such confidential information, that could also help to boost confidence in the operation of these teams, which are a very important and significant development in crime prevention in the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was in 1999, at Tampere, that, for the first time in the history of European integration, the Heads of State and Government of the 15 Member States of the Union put justice-related issues at the top of their political agenda and gave the commitment that an area of freedom, security and justice would be established within a maximum of five years.
One of the Union' s major objectives is, therefore, to enable its citizens to live in this area of freedom, security and justice, which must be an area in which freedom goes hand in hand with a high level of security, and it is in this framework that the creation and operation of joint investigation teams are being planned.
The call for the rapid creation of joint investigation teams was made at Tampere as the first stage in the fight against trafficking in human beings and drugs and against terrorism.
In the wake of the appalling events of 11 September, this initiative has come to the fore as part of a framework of measures to be adopted in the fight against terrorism and seeks to secure the adoption of a framework decision that will provide a legal framework to enable us to set up joint investigation teams made up of members of the police and judges who are specially trained in the fight against terrorism and of representatives of the Provisional Judicial Cooperation (Pro-Eurojust) unit and Europol, in order to coordinate investigations undertaken in this field.
I share the rapporteur, Mr Kirkhope' s, enthusiasm for this initiative and I congratulate him on the work he has carried out, which seeks to speed up the entry into force of the provisions of the Convention, still not ratified to date, that are considered to be most urgent by the Member States.
I must draw your attention, however, to the need for this Convention to be ratified quickly so as to prevent the risk of any potential fragmentation of this legal mechanism.
Furthermore, we must also welcome the extension of Europol' s sphere of action to all serious forms of international crime, which are listed in the annex to the Convention, for this will help to make cooperation under the Europol Convention more effective.
Priority areas for action must, nevertheless, be identified according to trends in crime in the Union.
You will all agree that, now more than ever, we must devote particular attention to terrorism.
Mr President, never has there been more need for a stronger Europe to address the issues of citizens' security and freedom, to implement that area of freedom, security and justice that the Treaty of Amsterdam promised us and the Tampere European Council planned to create.
The momentum to implement the necessary measures has repeatedly faltered in the face of often short-sighted resistance on the part of the governments.
It took the tragedy of 11 September to, at last, shake up a large number of our leaders and substantial impetus has been lent to the adoption of certain necessary measures.
I fervently hope that it will not take more tragedies to set the Tampere process in motion, not least because the laws made under the emotional pressure of inhuman tragedies are not always wise ones. In these cases, we are sometimes in danger of disregarding the need to safeguard peoples' fundamental rights.
I am glad to say that the three reports before us do not fall into this trap and I particularly welcome the contributions of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which tabled amendments improving the proposal.
Mr Kirkhope' s report calls upon us to support the proposal of four Member States to adopt a framework decision on joint investigation teams, already provided for by the Tampere European Council and the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union, endorsed by Parliament a year ago when it adopted the Di Pietro report.
Therefore, Mr Kirkhope' s report deserves the widest consensus, not least because it contains amendments improving the proposal with regard to respect for fundamental rights, parliamentary scrutiny and extending the use of joint investigation teams to combat organised crime as well as terrorism and trafficking in drugs and human beings.
Mr Turco' s reports, as adopted by the Committee on Citizen' s Freedoms, going against the rapporteur' s recommendation, move that we should adopt the two proposals on Europol with appropriate amendments.
The first stipulates that Europol' s mandate may be extended to all serious forms of organised crime already listed in the Annex to the Convention in accordance with the priorities established by the Council upon the proposal of Europol' s management board.
The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms' amendment on the subject moves that this decision should be a qualified majority decision adopted by the Council after it has consulted the European Parliament and obtained the opinion of Eurojust, a body which is particularly experienced in this field.
I am sad to see that, although the Members of the European People' s Party voted for the motion in committee, they have now changed their minds and feel that Eurojust' s opinion should not now be taken into consideration. The opinion is certainly not binding but it is certainly very useful, and it would be absurd not to make use of it.
We therefore support the first Turco report, as tabled in committee.
The second Turco report on the transmission of personal data from Europol to third States also warrants full consensus.
I would say that, irrespective of the rapporteur' s opinion which we have heard today, these proposals should be adopted en masse.
However, I fully agree with what the rapporteur has said, which is also stressed in the amendments adopted in committee. They firmly reiterate the opinion, often expressed by Parliament, that it is becoming increasingly necessary to communitise the instruments of judicial cooperation and to consolidate the judicial and democratic control of these instruments, which are, in fact, quite vital.
Ladies and gentlemen, our group backs the report by Mr Kirkhope and certainly the words he has spoken this evening.
I believe that the joint investigation teams are a positive step in the fight against all kinds of organised crime.
First of all, in connection with the Turco report, which specifically deals with the two aspects of Europol' s scope, extending the mandate appears to be a rather pointless exercise if Europol is unable to carry out the mandate properly.
After all, Europol' s usefulness has so far proved very limited in practice.
Moreover, Europol does indeed work with police and court information but is not involved in any way in the internal security service in practice.
This creates an imbalance and repressive action after the events without sufficient preventive action.
Secondly, with regard to the databases, the call for a decentralised system is justified on account of manageability.
It would therefore be a big step forward if every Member State were to develop such a database.
These initiatives are therefore to be welcomed, but the same cracks seem to be appearing again.
On the one hand, we are relying too heavily on the benevolence, or lack thereof, of the Member States, while on the other hand, there appears to be an evident lack of confidence in democracy, notably parliamentary supervision of this highly important area of policy.
If we are truly concerned about the protection of civil rights and the maintenance of democracy, we must, without delay, build an adequate system based on criminal law that can meet the challenges we are now facing, and invest in a powerful preventive policy.
Internal security services, in particular, have an important role to play here.
The cooperation between the internal security services and the judicial services, in other words, between preventive and repressive action, must be better coordinated as a matter of urgency, with the emphasis placed firmly on the prevention of serious crimes.
Mr President, the European Union, in close collaboration with the United States, has used the terrorist attack on 11 September as a reason to speed up the witch hunt on anyone who stands up to their imperialist plans and preferences.
And Europe, which is being given wider and wider powers, powers which go beyond national laws and constitutional protection for its citizens, is being called on to play the lead role here.
The information collated in the Member States, the well-known files, are now common currency; joint files are being kept on potential suspects, that is, every one of us, and the distribution list for these files is getting longer and longer.
Joint investigation teams basically have carte blanche, in that they are set up by however many Member States want to, for however long they want, with the involvement of any services they want and for whatever purpose they think fit.
This is an orchestrated attack on grass-roots movements.
They want to extinguish the personal and collective rights and democratic freedoms that workers have fought for.
Unfortunately, not only do the reports make no attempt to put a halt to this anti-grass roots and anti-democratic development; on the contrary, they incorporate it in an overall reform of the means available for judicial and police assistance.
Mr President, it has never been so appropriate as now, in the wake of the events of 11 September, to establish joint investigation teams to improve cooperation between all the national investigation teams, particularly with a view to enhancing and speeding up that necessary exchange of fresh information between all the information services of the Member States of the European Union.
Clearly, this is a police cooperation tool that will be of truly strategic importance in preventing crime. It is a vital, useful tool which will help to tackle the critical terrorist situation in Europe in the wake of the severe international crisis caused by the attack on the twin towers.
We have all had the opportunity, although, sadly, only since the New York and Washington carnage, to reconstruct the series of preparations for terrorist attacks made on our own European territory over the years by people and organisations linked to Osama Bin Laden: the many, apparently unimportant signs actually linked by a single thread and whose connection, sadly, we did not realise until it was too late, until after 11 September, when thousands of innocent people had already died.
Clearly, closer judicial and police cooperation involving more joint investigations might well have made us more effective in preventing terrorist crimes.
However, it is worth noting that, in addition to helping us respond to the critical terrorist situation, joint investigation teams would also play a useful general role in helping to fight the many phenomena linked to large-scale organised crime at international level such as the illegal trafficking of arms and drugs and the trafficking and exploitation of human beings.
Mr President, I would like to end by thanking Mr Kirkhope and pointing out that the fight against crime, both terrorism-related and general, has, for years now, been the subject of the most insistent requests from European citizens, who are demanding increasing efforts from the national and European institutions fully guaranteeing the fundamental, inalienable right to safety, that precious thing which is under increasing threat.
Therefore, I look forward to the greatest possible endeavours from the European Union too, making use, not least, of the tool of the joint investigation teams, precisely to restore the necessary confidence of the European citizens.
Mr President, it appears that the Council may have arrived.
If I am not mistaken, someone from the Council has arrived.
Is that so?
Are you from the Council?
We don' t know!
I would ask you not to address the Commission or the Council in a direct or personal fashion.
Any comment of this nature that you wish to make should be made through the Presidency.
Thank you, Mr Cappato.
Mr President, I was, in fact, addressing you in order to ask you whether we have, in effect, been honoured by the arrival of the Council.
I just wanted to point out that the Council was not present at this debate and has arrived only now. I just wanted everyone to realise, to be aware of the consideration given to Parliament' s decisions and debates, the translation into 11 languages, the amendments translated into 11 languages, the speeches translated into 11 languages, which serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever.
We are discussing the extension of the European police coordination mandate to include the most serious crimes; indeed we are aware that the coordination of information is, in itself, an implementing power, and that the distinction between coordination powers and implementing powers is very, very fine, hazy and difficult to define; we are therefore plumbing the depths of Member States' police and police cooperation policies. The implications for our countries and our codes of criminal procedure are huge, for, as we know, procedures vary greatly between the 15 Member States in terms of the relationship between the police and the law and the government.
Well then, all this is taking place without Parliament being given any say whatsoever in the legislative process, the process by which laws are formed, and I would stress, none whatsoever, without any input from democratically elected assemblies.
We know that President Prodi is in favour, yes, of course we do, but we also know that we are sacrificing with a single blow any balance of powers to the urgent, critical need for effectiveness in the fight against crime.
The Council official blithely arrives here at the very end of the debate.
Our speeches and decisions, the votes we take will serve no purpose at all, for Presidency itself has decreed that this and other debates are to be held at the same time as the meeting of the committee responsible, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which is voting now, at this very moment.
Therefore, the two Non-attached Members and the other three or four Members who are in the Chamber are missing the vote on terrorism and the European arrest warrant because of this decision which, I feel, ties in with the Council' s decision not to be present during this debate and is typical of the way the European Union legislates.
Mr President, the extension of Europol' s mandate is not some new issue that has arisen after 11 September.
It is, however, self-evident that, right now, there is a particularly great need for such an extension.
Naturally, we need to exchange information with third countries' police forces in order to help them combat crime, a fact that was emphasised by an as good as unanimous Parliament when we voted on the report on combating computer-related crime.
There are those who are anxious about Europol' s being given unduly large resources.
They might like to reflect upon the consequences of Europol' s having 388 employees to cover a population larger than the United States' s, while the FBI has 27 000 employees.
There is no comparison at all between the resources involved, nor between the activities concerned. Europol is not operational.
When information is transferred, it is incredibly important that we should continue to protect data and, as far as possible, to maintain personal privacy.
The human rights we have laid down both in the European Convention and in the European Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights are a characteristically European feature of which we should be proud and which we should also be sure to maintain.
We must nonetheless beware of creating a Big Brother society.
Just as Mr Turco emphasised, it is therefore important that Parliament be there to exercise its democratic control.
It is quite unreasonable that these issues should be excluded from the structures of the EU and that issues which are so very important to people should be discussed in a largely empty Chamber.
The fact that crime statistics are being gathered is naturally welcome.
There is something not quite right about the fact that the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon gathers a large quantity of statistics concerning drug addiction, while we have little in the way of statistics when it comes to the fight against crime.
Europol naturally has an important role to fulfil in this area.
When it comes to the issue of whether or not Eurojust should be mentioned in this context, it has emerged that many people interpret the wording in terms of a desire to upset the balance of power between the executive and the judiciary.
It should not, of course, be interpreted in that way.
I do not, however, want any misunderstandings to arise concerning this matter. To avoid misunderstandings, it would therefore be better to change the Eurojust wording.
Finally, I want to thank Mr Turco for having dealt with the Swedish and Belgian initiative so well.
Mr President, the two government initiatives on Europol that we are examining today, the first on the definition of areas of action, the second on the rules on the transmission of personal data, provide the European Parliament with the opportunity to raise a genuine question, which is how to organise democratic control over Europol.
This is a very important question, since police and judicial cooperation and, in particular, the management of analysis files that are kept by Europol, are very closely related to civil liberties.
Today, since Europol is an intergovernmental body, it is controlled by the national parliaments; first and foremost, by the governments at the Council of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs or their representatives on Europol' s management board, and lastly by a supervisory body made up of leading, independent figures.
The relevant parliamentary committee is proposing to completely change this system, even though it has only been in operation since 1999, and would like to entrust control of Europol solely to Community procedures, in other words, to the European Parliament.
We do not think this proposal is suitable.
We do not consider the European Parliament to be the appropriate institution to undertake the democratic monitoring of sovereign police operations in the Member States, which are carried out by the national services and have implications for the very territory of the Member States.
It would be better to keep an open mind while Europol is just beginning to carry out its work and to give the national parliaments the chance to organise and refine their control.
They are also aware of this need.
For example, in September, the French Parliament imposed a ban on its parliament debating the draft agreements between Europol and Eastern European countries. It then lifted this ban when it had sufficient guarantees as to the security of the transmission of personal data.
We believe that this is a very positive approach.
It is evidence that there is effective control by the national parliaments.
In order to exercise this control further, the French Senate has also set up an internal specialised working group responsible for investigating issues of police and judicial cooperation.
This is the example we should be following, Mr President, and we should even, without doubt, go further by improving horizontal coordination of the control carried out by the national parliaments.
They should work together in setting up an interparliamentary assembly to monitor Europol and police and judicial cooperation.
Better still, the Intergovernmental Conference, which is due to meet in 2004 and which, in fact, must deal with the role of national parliaments within the European structure, should propose to develop this type of interparliamentary cooperation and turn this into a new pillar of the European Union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission considers these three initiatives to be particularly important, especially now, at a time when cooperation not only between Member States but also between the European Union and third countries and international organisations is crucial if we want to combat organised crime and, in particular, terrorism, effectively.
The initiatives we are discussing today are intended to speed up the timetable, to bring forward the time when the Member States will have a Community legal basis for establishing joint investigation teams which, if necessary, could include representatives of third countries or of international organisations, to extend Europol' s mandate to enable it to deal with a wider range of criminal activities, and also to enable Europol to transmit personal data to third countries and to other organisations effectively. This will undoubtedly be an important factor in ensuring that cooperation with these third countries and with these international organisations is reliable and functions effectively.
The Commission welcomes the fact that the European Parliament supports the draft framework decision on joint investigation teams that Belgium, Spain, France and the United Kingdom have proposed.
We hope that the time saved by allowing Member States to put together such teams will enhance the effectiveness of the fight against transnational crime.
The Commission also welcomes the fact that Parliament has given a positive response to the proposal to extend Europol' s mandate and to allow the transmission of personal data to third countries and other organisations.
These two initiatives will help to make Europol an organisation which is more effective in the fight against organised crime, a matter which is of increasing concern to the public of the Member States of the European Union.
Mr Turco' s report raises the issue of the democratic control of Europol with regard to the initiatives in question.
In June this year, I had the opportunity to discuss this issue at the interparliamentary conference organised by the Dutch government in The Hague, which was attended by representatives of practically all national parliaments of the Member States and which Mr Turco also attended.
In light of the discussion that took place on that occasion with the representatives of the national parliaments, the Commission, as provided for in its working programme for this year, is now finalising its communication on the democratic control of Europol, in which it will put forward a number of ideas designed to improve this process.
As you will be aware, this democratic control cannot and must not exclude the irreplaceable role of the national parliaments, specifically with regard to control of their national Europol antennas.
Indeed, it must not only enable interparliamentary cooperation with national parliaments, but also provide the added value that comes from Parliament' s commitment to democratic control so as to ensure that, in this way, through close cooperation between the European Parliament and the national parliaments, we are able to develop an overall picture of how Europol is actually working without losing any elements of the detailed work produced by national parliaments on their own actions to exercise control over Europol.
At the same time, I acknowledge the importance of coordination between Europol and Eurojust and of the role Eurojust should play in relation to the judicial supervision of Europol.
I do feel, however, that it would be preferable to wait for the Council' s decision, which will determine the final form Eurojust is to take, before we move ahead with solutions on coordination between police and courts at European level.
With regard to extending Europol's mandate, the Commission takes note of and shares the concerns expressed in the report about the decision-making structure under the Union's third pillar.
This is indeed slow because priorities tend to change from one presidency to the next, and the role of Parliament itself is limited.
We therefore welcome the fact that the European Parliament has emphasised the need for the situations of organised crime in each Member State to be reflected when priorities are established in the fight against organised crime at European level.
Hence the importance of Member States providing Europol with sufficient, timely information so that it can produce an annual report on the situation of organised crime in the European Union of the required standard.
With regard to the amendments proposed in Parliament' s report, the Commission might propose that the public version of this annual report be annexed to the report that Europol also submits annually to the European Parliament.
Lastly, with regard to the initiative on the transmission of personal data, the Commission broadly supports the amendments Parliament has proposed.
It shares the opinion that the safeguards for data protection provided today under Article 7 of the 1999 Council Act on data transmitted to third countries and to international organisations, also apply to the transmission of data arising from this Swedish initiative.
Since, in this case, the Swedish initiative only changes Article 5(5) of the aforementioned 1999 Council Act, Article 7, which is the article relevant to this matter, will still apply in full.
Hence my doubts as to whether there is a genuine need for the proposed amendment to Article 7 of the Council Act.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote on this item will take place tomorrow at noon.
Extradition between Member States (1995 and 1996 Conventions - Schengen Acquis)
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0371/2001) by Mr Marinho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on an Initiative of the Kingdom of Sweden with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision determining which provisions of the 1995 Convention on simplified extradition procedure between the Member States of the European Union and of the 1996 Convention relating to extradition between the Member States of the European Union constitute developments of the Schengen acquis in accordance with the Agreement concerning the Republic of Iceland's and the Kingdom of Norway's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis.
Mr President, Commissioner, curiously, two European States that have never been members of the European Union, Norway and Iceland, were the first to establish, on a regional basis, an area for the free movement of persons.
Towards the end of 1957, through the Nordic Passport Union, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Iceland, five European States, opened their borders to people while another six sketched out a common market, giving priority to the movement of goods in a Customs Union.
The two groups of States chose to take quite different routes: the first establishing EFTA, and the second aiming for a Europe that would be united in more than just economic terms.
Fortunately, the project embodied by the Six, which are today Fifteen and will soon be almost double that, although the more ambitious and complex of the two, has proved to be more than just a facilitator of free trade or of border crossing.
It has proved to be attractive to many of the founders of the Nordic institutions and, for that very reason, our report attempts to make sense of the contradictions and the chance events of history, by integrating Norway and Iceland into the Schengen area and, most importantly, in the case of the Swedish initiative, into the European Union' s area of freedom, security and justice.
Thus, this Swedish initiative extends the Union' s area of free movement beyond the official geographical borders of Europe, with the corresponding consequences for the legal and judicial sphere, making Norway and Iceland countries in which the common rules on extradition contained in the Schengen acquis will apply.
Who could have imagined, 45 years ago, that this would be possible?
Underpinning this historical development, or rather, this need, which implies new requirements and commitments, and thereby changes Europe and requires it to make progress, is the certainty that the Tampere programme, which involves moving from the intergovernmental method to the Community method, will lead to the communitisation of judicial cooperation, because this is what the governments of the Fifteen wanted, because the work of the Commission and of Commissioner Vitorino must not be betrayed by ongoing hesitancy on the grounds of sovereignty and, most importantly, because the situation today requires Europe to have a legal and criminal protection system that serves as the primary instrument for combating international and cross-border crime.
The real difference, which should make us proud to be Europeans, does not lie in our military arsenal but in the quality of the new European laws that we in this House are helping, or will help to construct. These laws will have the power to reconcile deterrence and respect for freedoms without attacking the philosophical and cultural differences that shape the criminal law of any Member State.
The European arrest warrant, based on the principle of mutual recognition of national court sentences, is, in the form proposed by Commissioner Vitorino, an example we should follow when considering the other aspects of Tampere, particularly the harmonisation of criminal law.
For all of these reasons, I hope that this Swedish initiative, which we welcome as timely and necessary, rapidly becomes obsolete, having been superseded by effective Community law, specifically on the arrest warrant, eliminating the two Union conventions, which were, admittedly, well-intentioned, but of limited effect.
The idea is that these will be replaced by the mutual recognition of court sentences and the simple transfer of persons guilty of committing crimes, a step, Commissioner, which will create a single European area for extradition.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will first thank the rapporteur, who has analysed this very technical report with great expertise and proposed a range of editorial amendments that we can all support.
We, likewise, welcome and support the Swedish initiative, which is before us now, to further develop the Schengen acquis.
Some parts of it have, however, already been overtaken by reality, as the breakneck speed of developments in European internal affairs and justice policy since the terrorist attacks on 11 September might well have made this report and this submission largely obsolete, at least as regards extradition policy.
Thus, the Council of Ministers of Internal Affairs and of Justice, on 20 September, had already set in motion a simpler procedure for handing over criminals and for the mutual recognition of court judgments.
We welcome the fact that there is broad European agreement on criminal law and criminal procedure as well.
This will lead to better combating of crime on our continent and promote the Community legal area.
This being so, I could save myself further great speeches on the Swedish initiative, as Mr Marinho has already made the main points.
I would, though, like to enlarge on one point, namely that the provisions of the 1995 EU Agreement on simplified extradition procedures and the 1996 EU Agreement on extradition between Member States are, according to this proposal, to be extended to Iceland and Norway as a further development of the Schengen acquis.
So far, so good.
Yet, out of Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and England, none have, to date, ratified one of these agreements.
This is especially scandalous in view of the candidate states having undertaken to accept the Schengen acquis.
The Member States must at last become aware of their need to set an example, specifically as regards the transposition and ratification of EU acts.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Marinho on his excellent work on this report and say that we are all aware of how sensitive and how incontrovertibly important issues such as asylum policy, measures to combat crime, the improvement of external border controls and the fight against terrorism are for the Member States.
Nevertheless, I would say that we also all understand now that common problems require common solutions, that to resolve them effectively and coherently, apart from the national dimension, the necessary European dimension must also be in place.
The main objectives of police and judicial cooperation on criminal matters in the European Union are the fight against transnational organised crime and the approximation of legal and statutory provisions.
Nevertheless, in the field of judicial cooperation, Schengen has concentrated its efforts on ensuring that requests for extradition are rapidly dealt with by means of the Schengen Information System (SIS).
The Swedish initiative that we are considering today does not contain, as Mr Marinho has already stated, major substantive provisions, specifically in the field of extradition, and seeks mainly to clarify the relationship between the various positions on extradition at European Union level and involve Iceland and Norway in the implementation of these provisions.
It is crucial that we make the area of justice and security in Europe a reality.
The events of 11 September clearly demonstrate the need to conduct the fight against terrorism not only by military means, but also with judicial instruments.
It is also worth pointing out that the European Union' s strategy for the beginning of the new millennium, the prevention and control of organised crime, already envisaged the possibility of a single legal area for extradition being created at European level.
The events of 11 September only reinforced the urgency and the need for such a decision.
This is why the Justice and Home Affairs Council took the decision, on 20 September, as part of its objective of combating terrorism, to replace the extradition process within the Union with a simple process of handing over the perpetrators of such crimes, which will render obsolete all laws on extradition currently in force, as has already been stated, and will involve the removal and replacement of the two conventions on extradition through the mutual recognition of court sentences and through simply handing over the perpetrator of the crime, thereby creating the single European area for extradition, the need for which we also wish to highlight.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission' s job has been greatly simplified in this debate, because it needs only to fully agree with the speech by Mr Marinho, whom I should like to congratulate on his excellent report.
I simply wish to add that, in the view of the Commission, this initiative by Sweden is important and useful because it clarifies that the laws on extradition contained in the 1995 and 1996 conventions can be integrated into the Schengen acquis, an idea that has important consequences, particularly in light of the decisions that Mr Coelho has just mentioned and which were adopted by the Council of Justice and Home Affairs on 20 September.
Completely replacing the rules on extradition within the European Union with the mechanism of the European search and arrest warrant will have an effect on the Schengen acquis and must also be reflected in the workings of the Schengen Convention.
Furthermore, for this very reason, because our aim is to replace the 1995 and 1996 conventions, the issue must also be raised of extending the European search and arrest warrant to cover Norway and Iceland once the mandate is adopted by the Council, which I hope will happen on 6 and 7 December.
This debate is, therefore, not pointless; it is one step forwards, one step on the path that we hope will lead to approval by the Council of Justice and Home Affairs of the European search and arrest warrant, in order to consolidate the area of freedom, security and justice in the field of protecting fundamental rights and of combating transnational organised crime, especially terrorism.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Electronic communications (processing of personal data and protection of privacy)
The next item is the debate on the second report (A5-0374/2001) by Mr Cappato, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector.
Here we are again, Mr President, and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is still voting on terrorism. Never mind.
Second attempt: privacy in the electronic communications sector.
I seem to remember that, last time, this House failed in its attempt to adopt a majority position because the two proposals made on the issue of unsolicited commercial e-mails - the proposal for compulsory European opt-in and the proposal allowing Member States the freedom to choose whether to opt in or opt out - as well as a joint proposal presented to the Members, too late in my view, cancelled each other out.
The three proposals, therefore, cancelled each other out.
Now, however, I feel that Parliament is, at last, ready to take a decision on this point, since the position of the Parliamentary Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights leaving the Member States the freedom to choose and the position of the Commission, compulsory European opt-in, have both been tempered, so to speak, and have become more reconciled in that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has taken into consideration the concerns relating to voice mail, in particular, and, on the other hand, the position advocating the introduction opting in, making an initial binding choice, at European level has taken into consideration the need to communicate with existing clients of a particular company or business.
I hope that the Members and the groups, in particular, will be able to decide between these two alternatives without getting confused at the last minute. Parliament will have the opportunity to choose between these two alternatives.
In my opinion, and I would like to make this quite clear, there is not enough information or evidence showing that the countries operating the opt-in system are better equipped to fight spamming.
Internet spamming is illegal in any case, because it is already illegal to collect addresses without authorisation, it is already illegal to use them without authorisation, it is already illegal to send messages without clearly specifying the sender and it is already illegal to send messages without making it possible for the recipients to delete their details easily from the lists.
On the other hand, making opting in compulsory is not without risks either, in terms, for example, of freedom of communication.
It is no accident that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has been cautious on this matter.
There are, in fact, groups of non-governmental organisations which have expressed their concern at the possibility, for example, of Internet campaigns being used to raise funds.
I feel that this debate, this legislation, has now already been made obsolete by technology and practical facts. It appears that consumers now already have the facility to choose, themselves, individually, between an opt-in or opt-out system, without having to contact the sender of the message before deleting their details from the lists but simply placing the address of the sender in question on a black list so that they no longer have to receive messages from that sender.
However, in view of the fact that six years have passed since the adoption of the General Data Protection Directive and many of the Member States have still not ratified it, that four years have passed since the adoption of the directive to be amended by this proposal for a directive and that many of the Member States have not even applied the ' 97 directive, it is reasonable to predict, given these time frames, that this legislation will also take who knows, maybe three, four or five years to enter into force.
If, in three, four or five years' time, consumers and users really feel the need to be protected against unsolicited commercial e-mails, the market and technology will make the systems already available today even more simple.
It would be a shame, however, if, after displaying this great, understandable concern about the nuisance caused by unsolicited commercial e-mails, we prepared, on the other hand, to give national police authorities full access to our personal data whenever they want it.
This is not purely a problem of this directive: it is a more general political problem. I realise this.
I fear that this is the direction in which we are heading and that the citizens' greatest privacy concerns are not caused by the prospect of receiving a few more or less unsolicited commercial e-mails.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have already voted once on this report.
Now, at second reading stage, all we have to do is find a solution to the opt-in/opt-out problem.
I will therefore be speaking only about that.
Looking at the various proposals currently before Parliament reveals, in my opinion, that they are different kinds of opt-out proposals.
Only the Commission's document would mean a real opting-in.
This means, then, that only the Commission's proposal would guarantee that citizens would themselves be able to say that they wanted 'spamming' , that is to say, to receive electronic advertising, or that they wanted to have the option of consistently refusing it.
All other options, that is, the various proposed opt-outs, do not, in my judgment, guarantee this.
So I cannot be greatly satisfied with what is offered here as a compromise, and I believe that, to live up to the title of this proposal, a text with some bearing on data protection would have to be passed, in which case you have no option but to take the Commission's line, support this proposal, and reject the other proposals that have been submitted to Parliament.
Nevertheless, I am in fundamental agreement with much of this report and find many of the points addressed in it sensible.
But that was voted on at the last session.
Now, it is just about the opting out and opting in.
I think that, if we are talking in terms of data protection, we have to support the Commission's proposal.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we will be voting on the Cappato report for the second time.
Our positions have moved closer, without, however, becoming identical.
So the rapporteur has taken misgivings on the left of this House into account, in that the consumer's consent will in future be required for the sending of SMS advertising.
The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has accepted by a substantial majority the so-called soft opt-out compromise supported by the rapporteur.
This proposal alone defends the interests of consumers without doing away with European jobs on a massive scale.
Why?
If Parliament were to generally prohibit business-to-customer advertising from the outset, as Mrs Paciotti's proposal would have it, businesses would simply send their advertising material into the European Union from the USA or other third States.
The European consumer would have gained nothing, absolutely nothing, and the only effect would be to weaken the European e-business market.
We therefore want to let those states that at present have an opt-out system retain it, keep an eye on developments and come to a new decision after two years.
At the same time, the Cappato proposal takes three steps to protect the consumer.
First, the consumer can put his name on what is termed a 'Robinson list' , so that advertising material may not generally be sent to him.
Secondly, the consumer can, simply and without charge, indicate his wish not to receive e-mail advertising from specific companies.
Thirdly, e-mail advertising will be easily recognisable as such in the inbox and will be able to be deleted simply and without cost.
This last option is already available from providers such as AOL - I am sure Mr van Velzen is about to point that out - but this does not put AOL in a monopolistic position.
Such an assertion is complete nonsense, as anyone can already download from the Internet a spam recognition program of this sort, no matter what Internet Service Provider he has a contract with for everything else.
By the way, AOL was itself opposed to such a regulation.
So I would ask you to support Mr Cappato's proposed compromise by a significant majority.
Mr President, the return of this file to committee has certainly made the positions clearer, but I feel it has not improved the result: it fact it has, to some extent, had quite the opposite effect.
Indeed, last time it voted, the European Parliament had the wisdom to accept the Commission' s proposal at least on the point relating to electronic directories, thereby ensuring that each of us is free to choose whether to be included in a public directory.
Thus, the decision, which I consider to be a mistake and damaging not just in terms of freedom but of the very development of electronic commerce as well, to allow the sending of unwanted messages while leaving recipients the option to complain and request not to be sent any more, appeared to be less harmful too.
By refusing the proposal for opting into public directories for everybody, without even making an exception for mobile phones, we are all placing ourselves at the mercy of all kinds of annoying petitioners and solicitors.
We do not even have the protection that once existed in the days when there were only fixed telephones and printed directories.
In those days, we could protect ourselves effectively by becoming ex-directory or changing our telephone numbers. Nowadays, when every public directory ends up on the Internet, we have no way of protecting ourselves.
We can ask for our phone number or e-mail address to be deleted but it is no use!
By now, it is in the hands of users and parties who cannot be traced.
Therefore, deciding to amend Article 12 of the directive would really appear not to benefit us in terms of freedom and, quite frankly, I fail to understand how we can give freedom of advertising precedence over individual freedoms.
As far as unsolicited messages, as mentioned in Article 13 of the directive, are concerned, giving the Member States the choice takes away the usefulness of the directive itself in view of the need for harmonisation.
Quite frankly, I cannot believe that all this will benefit electronic commerce.
In fact, I feel that, as well as people such as our rapporteur, who is expert at using electronic tools, there are also still many, many citizens like myself who have little aptitude for such tools and are therefore concerned.
To be honest, I can promise you that I will not be sending requests to any businesses and I will not open any messages for fear that what currently happens to me will continue, even though I am protected in my country, namely that my provider, no less, which has of necessity to know my address, constantly sends me unwanted communications and so, alas, does an airline which I once made the mistake of emailing.
I therefore feel that, until I am protected - I am speaking on my own behalf but there are also many other people, older people like myself or people who have less expertise than many young people - I will do without electronic commerce, because it is not something in which I have confidence.
The idea of being in a directory which is accessible throughout the entire Internet, of receiving messages and then requesting that they be deleted, of having to open them first, of having to try and understand these tools, does not inspire me with confidence.
It may be that as electronic commerce develops, it will provide greater protection, but it does need to develop first. We must start by allowing electronic commerce to develop, but in order to do so we need to have confidence in it, and this proposal does not inspire that confidence.
Mr President, it is not often that I completely agree with my colleague in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr von Boetticher, but this time I agree with him that we need a national choice regime to allow opt-out on e-mails and I am speaking against the socialist amendments.
There is one great myth that has gripped the Left and that is that spam is the same as unsolicited e-mail.
I am afraid to say, Commissioner, that the Commission is at the root of this confusion.
In your original proposal you said that spam equals unsolicited e-mails.
It is not true.
I am afraid the spammers who are already breaking the law are going to carry on breaking the law.
Mrs Paciotti, you will continue to get spam!
I support the opt-out on two grounds.
The first is that opt-in will unjustifiably harm both business and charities.
Big American firms can afford TV advertising, press, billboard and so on.
We are going to damage small- and medium-sized European firms for whom commercial e-mail provides a legitimate way into e-commerce.
It is going to put them at a disadvantage.
It is going to put charities at a disadvantage and studies show that people do not mind receiving them.
They will not opt out even if they could.
But of course it is human nature not to opt in to get them.
There is also a misunderstanding about the civil liberties implications.
Under opt-out, it is very easy to show that you have opted out and reputable senders have no interest in ignoring your request because they will just irritate you.
Opt-in is superficially pro-consumer, but you would have to prove that you never opted in, which is actually more difficult.
Finally, under an opt-in regime, people might opt to receive mailings from organisations that could be embarrassing for them, such as gay organisations when they did not wish to come out, or they could be open to malicious abuse.
If they opted in to get mailings from subversive political movements they could find themselves attracting unwarranted surveillance from the police, for instance.
The Left has got it wrong and for once Mr von Boetticher is right.
Mr President, although in my view, national legislation is preferable to European legislation in most cases, this is different in this report.
In the case of direct marketing by e-mail, this is clearly a matter with cross-border implications.
I do not call for a complete ban on direct marketing by e-mail, but it is of the utmost importance for consumers to be given the choice beforehand whether they want to deal with this kind of direct marketing and for them to grant their approval or not, as the case may be.
After all, that saves them a great deal of time, money and bother.
Rapporteur Cappato suggests leaving the choice of opting in or out to the Member States.
However, that would produce an incoherent European policy.
A Member State that has chosen in favour of opting in will experience many difficulties in countering unwanted e-mails, if Member States that have chosen in favour of opting out do permit them.
If European policy is divided and fragmented, the chances of establishing international agreements concerning unwanted e-mails are as good as non-existent.
The problem is that businesses can easily side-step European rules from countries outside the European Union.
This should not stop us from drafting legislation at European level.
It is preferable to look for practical solutions to these problems and to work on international agreements.
In that way, you and I will not be faced with e-mails from businesses which we do not need at all.
Mr President, allow me to say straight away that although I represent a minority position, I am very proud of it.
I have the 'Automatiseringsgids' of a famous Dutch newspaper, in front of me.
On behalf of all my fellow MEPs who want to learn from technology neutrality, it might be useful to read out a few quotes from it.
NTT DoCoMo earmarks USD 8.2 million to control unsolicited e-mails on mobile phones.
The e-mail addresses of NTT DoCoMo mobile phones are based on the phones' telephone numbers.
That enables all kinds of advertising agencies and dating agencies to advertise their services by sending messages to randomly generated numbers.
The article also states that in Japan, the receiver of the text message contributes towards the cost of sending it.
This might be food for thought for all those people who claim that the proposal of Amendment No 35 by Mr Cappato is technology-neutral.
It clearly is not, for as soon as one is faced with UMTS, the difference between e-mail and SMS fades into the background, with all the consequences that this entails.
That is why it is much preferable to talk about electronic communications, as is done in Amendment No 44.
That is, in fact, the final step which rapporteur Cappato should have taken in order to put an excellent proposal before us.
Let us be very aware that citizens are not all computer-illiterate.
Despite this, they are saddled with most problems.
If we were to adopt the proposal of Amendment No 35 by Mr Cappato to change e-mail services of this kind, the entire computer system would need to be changed. Indeed, we would then need to change over from the POP 3 system, which nearly everyone in Europe has, to the e-map system which is offered by only one American provider.
However, if that were the case, the Commissioner would immediately receive a complaint about the lack of competition in Europe.
That is another reason why I believe it should not be done.
I therefore propose approving the Cappato report but also improving on it further by voting in favour of Amendment No 44 instead of Amendment No 35.
Mr President, unusually for me I can stand here and say that virtually everything has been said.
I agree with Mr von Boetticher and Mr Cappato and especially with Baroness Ludford.
We are all members of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs; we have adopted a position and we have not rushed into it just because we have been bullied and lobbied on the Internet and via the fax machines that are in all our offices.
We have to be very careful about legislating on the hoof.
I have to say to the Commission that what it is proposing is wrong and hurried.
In 2003 we will have a very good opportunity, in the e-commerce directive, to gather the information and the wisdom obtained from those Member States which have chosen either to opt in or to opt out.
We must only propose and adopt legislation on the basis of good counsel and good experience.
We must never underestimate the civil liberties implications to which Baroness Ludford has rightly alerted this House.
At this time, when we perhaps are being a little over-assertive with some of the legislation we are bringing forward, I do not want anyone to have to confirm why they have opted to receive, for instance, Ammunition Weekly or why they have chosen to get some information from Amnesty International.
The Internet has freed people from dictatorships and oppressors, and yet here we are introducing a kind of censorship by the back door.
It is wrong and ill-informed.
The Commissioner may shake his head and smile, but does he want to have to explain to a government agency or some other agency why he has chosen to opt in?
That is not freedom: that is being answerable for using a service that is intended to free you.
On the issue of the right of privacy: we all have the right of privacy, but that right cannot be imposed on individuals.
Individuals choose the right of privacy and then legislation backs it up.
On the matter of unsolicited commercial e-mail: not all UCE is spam.
Here again the Commission has played right into the hands of those who want to drive jobs out of the EU and who pretend that, just because the EU is imposing a ban on sending UCEs within its territory, such a ban will be respected by people in Japan, the Philippines, the USA or anywhere else.
Finally, on spamming, I myself have been spammed.
My name has been put on various lists and the spam comes in.
That has been done by individuals who have opted me in to the lists held by the spammers.
I have a very good option: I have a filter, I have a delete button.
We must encourage people to use the technology and stop being their nannies.
Please support the Cappato report, as amended.
Mr President, tonight British Members from three different political parties and other colleagues are going to be in agreement, which is a rare occurrence.
I am not a member of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, but I particularly want to commend Mr Cappato and colleagues here tonight for their courageous stand in amending the Commission's original proposal.
I was sorry that we did not uphold all of Mr Cappato's report last time.
This compromise has all the hallmarks of a compromise.
In other words it is not terribly satisfactory but at least it is better than the original proposal from the Commission, and the amendment by the Socialist Group which I hope will not be supported tomorrow.
We have to consider this essentially a transitional piece of work.
I think everyone here tonight is working on legislation in the electronic age.
I have worked on the e-commerce directive, the copyright directive and we are working on the electronic communications bills.
What is quite clear is the immense pace and change of technology and the reconstruction of markets that is going on all the time.
As a number of colleagues have said tonight, the world of electronic communications is offering immense benefits to the citizens, whether it is in their own personal access to charities or political parties or in the marketplace.
What some colleagues want to do, is to shut that down.
Clearly we cannot do that because it operates on a global level.
That is where the spam is coming from.
So we have promised something to our citizens we cannot deliver.
Clearly we have to work towards a global solution that will be driven by technology.
We want a global format that will allow people to tag their e-mail messages by sender and by subject.
We can have the technology to give people complete control.
If we adopt this proposal and pass this amendment, we will be walking away from the opportunity to create the right environment so that people can really benefit from the immense power of the new communications world.
The Commission has already expressed its position on the amendments that were adopted on 6 September.
I am tempted to go back to that debate, but I want to be brief and concentrate on the essential question about unsolicited e-mail.
I would just like to point out that the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 16, 25 and 34 that were rejected by Parliament on 6 September and are now resubmitted to the vote.
The Commission can support the new Amendment No 43 on itemised bills.
I will now focus on what has turned out to be the single most important topic in the debate on the proposed directive, namely unsolicited e-mail.
This House has been discussing the question of opting in or opting out for several years now and the result of the vote on 6 September showed how difficult it still is to find a compromise solution that is acceptable to a broad majority.
However we cannot hesitate for much longer, we need to decide.
We have not hurried this decision.
There has been huge public international debate with industry, with scientists, with lawyers.
I have myself participated in intensive debates in the United States and in Europe on this issue.
I strongly disagree that asking a person whether they wish to opt in before you can bill them is a restriction on civil liberties.
That is completely illogical.
We can disagree on the details, but if people are asked to pay, they should have a choice beforehand, not afterwards.
We should no longer be thinking mainly about messages arriving at a PC on our desk. We should be thinking about the future.
Technology is changing rapidly.
The wireless Internet will be different from the Internet available only on desktops.
The positive point about the proposal made by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms in Amendment No 33 is that it recognises that unsolicited commercial messages to mobile phones are a real problem which can only be addressed by a harmonised opt-in approach.
I fully agree.
However, the flaw in that proposal is that it is based on the assumption that a mobile terminal can only receive SMS messages.
Unfortunately that is no longer true.
You can already receive e-mail messages on mobile devices which are connected to the Internet.
If you want to test that I can give you good examples.
And with convergence it is very clear that SMS will certainly merge with other electronic messaging systems.
The sender cannot know whether a message will be received on a mobile or fixed terminal because of the convergence.
That is a technological fact.
Banning unsolicited commercial SMS messages while allowing unsolicited electronic messages based on other technologies is therefore not a workable solution.
Another problem I have with Amendment No 35 is the technologically biased approach in paragraph 4. This paragraph apparently tries to address the problem of cost for users but the solution proposed is not a good one.
European ISPs tell us that the technology of viewing the subject line before downloading a message is not compatible with the majority of systems used in Europe today.
It would require substantial investment; it would be costly for the industry to introduce this feature and this does not seem justified when it is only a halfway solution.
In short, apart from not being compatible with the single market, Amendment No 35 does not meet the need for technology-neutral and future-proof legislation.
Amendment No 44, on the other hand represents a technology-neutral compromise solution and has the merit of being a fully harmonised EU approach to unsolicited commercial e-mail.
In paragraph 2 of this amendment a rather substantial exemption from the opt-in principle is made for e-mail addresses obtained within existing customer relationships.
Here an opt-out approach would continue to be allowed, although this will mean an important concession as compared with the original Commission proposal.
The exception can be justified because in the context of an existing customer relationship, companies have a lot to lose and are more likely to use marketing instruments with consideration.
We should look at the future challenges.
It is interesting to see what is happening in Japan today, where the wireless Internet has already taken off successfully.
Nevertheless, the operator is facing a serious problem.
It estimates that 85% of the 950 million messages sent daily to mobile devices are unsolicited commercial messages to mobile numbers chosen at random.
This is causing a huge problem for network capacity, especially since most of these messages are addressed incorrectly and cannot be delivered.
Moreover, it greatly annoys users who have to work their way through great quantities of unwanted commercial messages.
The cost of purging the system of junk mail is estimated to be more than USD 8.2 million.
So if we want to create a positive environment for the development of electronic commerce and third generation mobile services, now is the time to make sure that the uptake of wireless Internet services is not hampered by huge amounts of junk mail which the consumer is paying for against his will.
Valuable capacity within networks and in battery-dependent mobile terminals must be available for communications, messages and services that users really want to receive.
Amendment No 44 is most likely to achieve that purpose.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
European films
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0351/2001) by Mr Vander Taelen, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on achieving better circulation of European films in the internal market and the candidate countries.
Mr President, I rise to speak in place of Ruth Hieronymi, who actually should have been speaking, but is unfortunately unwell.
I am very glad to be able to do so, and congratulate the rapporteur.
It is not that often that we have somebody speaking here who is as knowledgeable about his subject as is Mr Vander Taelen, who is a film-maker himself.
So, well done, my dear Mr Vander Taelen.
I think your report really does provide much needed impetus.
As you said, the market share of European films in the cinemas of the European Union is at an historic low point of only 22.5%.
The dominance of the American film industry is also reflected in the grossly excessive trade deficit of EUR 6.8 billion.
The situation in the acceding countries is even more dramatic.
There is another problem, apart from the clear dominance of films from the USA, which we must not draw a veil over.
We often talk in this House of our desire to promote European films, but many are thinking only of their own national film industry and not of their neighbour's, whose films, European films, are not seen in neighbouring regions often enough.
The Commission and the Council as well, must, as a matter of urgency, at last produce a plan to make the European film industry competitive.
This is also a sector in which there is money to be made, as the Americans show us.
Perhaps the powers-that-be will eventually wake up and do more here.
The central deficits are in the distribution and marketing of our films and, of course, the industry is chronically undercapitalised.
I am therefore very glad that we, Parliament, Commission and Council together, have, in the Media-Plus programme above all, got to grips with the twin areas of marketing and distribution and are endeavouring to give help.
I am, of course, also glad that, at the Commissioner's suggestion, the European Investment Bank is also willing to do something about this by making risk capital available for the realisation of audiovisual projects.
I believe, then, that we have given a lot of things a push in this area, but can do still more.
I also find it a good thing that we are achieving tax breaks at the level of the Member States, and that we can do something to enable filmmakers from one country to get resources and help from another.
That, then, is possible.
I think this could also be used in the framework of the i2i initiative to promote investment in the infrastructure of independent cinemas, as we propose in this report.
I believe that the extension of cinemas in economically weaker regions in the framework of the European Structural Fund can be helpful.
There is a lot more that I could say.
I am not entirely in agreement with item 7, in which the call is made for television broadcasters to be obliged to reserve a certain proportion of transmission time for foreign films.
That, of course, meets with great resistance from the broadcasters.
We will discuss that when examining the 'Television without Frontiers' directive and will perhaps find a way through.
Again, congratulations!
Mr President, I have to admit that I envy Mr Vander Taelen; not only does his report contain very meaningful conclusions, thanks to his remarkable knowledge of the film industry, but he also has tremendous vision and has tabled very specific proposals as to what we should do, what policy we should apply in connection with European films.
I think that this is an exemplary report in which the economy and culture are perceived in a highly coherent manner, to the benefit of both.
The committee naturally agreed that European films are an educational and cultural vehicle and have a huge impact on the social and aesthetic values of the European public.
I see it as a noble industry which has nourished generations of cinema goers and to which we have no hesitation in entrusting our children so that they can learn about the past and acquire a penetrating and analytical perception of the society in which we live and intuition about what will happen in the future.
We love European films; we each of us in our own countries love the national films which have marked out our lives, but we all agree that American films are stealing the show.
Consequently, we need to bring about a reversal, to ensure that European films take the place they deserve, and this will only happen if we implement a series of measures, as proposed in the report, all of which, I think, are essential if we really want European films to live up to our expectations in the next decade.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to thank Mr Vander Taelen for his sterling report.
I fully subscribe to his view that it is sheer madness to think that we produce excellent films in Europe, while only 22% of those end up in cinemas, not to mention the percentage of non-national films that are being shown in the Member States, despite the fact that for people of all ages, film is the ideal medium to get to know each other' s culture.
Why is it that European film attracts such a small audience, while the cinema-viewing public is on the increase?
It seems appropriate to me to commission the European Audiovisual Observatory to carry out an in-depth study into the motives of the film public and its film choices.
Based on this, it would then be possible to use a programme such as Media Plus to support the distribution of the European film in a more focused and effective manner.
In addition, the other media play an important role in the promotion of European film, of course.
Radio and television may devote attention to it, but television in particular could do so in a more structured way by means of a fixed amount, or quota, in other words, of transmission time.
An alternative example might be specific European channels which specialise in one particular field, for example, a pan-European children' s channel which broadcasts high-quality European children' s programmes and children' s films.
Unfortunately, I am not of the same mind as Mr Vander Taelen when he states that it should be compulsory for TV channels to invest a proportion of their turnover in the film industry.
As a Liberal, and also on behalf of my group, that is excessive intervention from the powers that be.
As has been stated before, it seems to me that the European Investment Bank has a role to play in this.
One of the areas in which investments must be made is e-cinema.
Among other things, it will enable producers to make different language versions of their films in a more straight-forward manner, which will certainly benefit children' s films, for example.
After all, although we insist on a sound command of languages here in this House, the supply of adapted language versions would be another excellent way for the citizens of a Member State to get to know the culture of their European fellow citizens.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that the report by Mr Vander Taelen has come just when it is needed.
It reminds me of when we arrived in Parliament two and a half years ago.
I realised that, in the space of two and a half years, by the autumn of 2001, we have gained the commitment of the European Investment Bank, the balance proposed by the Commission for state aid, the recognition of state aid, and now the report by Mr Vander Taelen is telling us that we must circulate films.
That is what I mean when I say it has come just when it is needed.
It has come just at the right moment to give great support to the audiovisual industry and to the cinema tradition, which we must highlight and which I see as a new development.
I would like us to get to grips with this, because we speak a great deal about cultural diversity, but tell me, please, what is cultural diversity if you do not circulate works?
If cultural diversity means to strengthen each specific characteristic within another specific characteristic, we will not gain anything in terms of diversity, in the way that we want to here in Europe.
It is therefore essential and necessary to circulate films.
In order to illustrate how important this is, I would first of all like to thank Mr Vander Taelen, and also to express my regret that one of his amendments, and not everyone agrees on this, since it was not reviewed by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, that one of his amendments, proposing that coercive measures be used to ensure the circulation of films, was not adopted.
We therefore reached an agreement on undertaking a feasibility study into this circulation. That is all very well, it sounds good.
I regret that we did not choose a better way.
And I would like to stress two other aspects of this report.
Firstly, in today' s Europe, we like to say that we have European works.
That is wonderful.
We have criteria to define European works, in terms of production, but we now know that it is film heritage which will also define and which defines European works.
I therefore welcome the fact that the rapporteur has highlighted the issue of building up our heritage.
We know that the Commission hopes to give us a European Cinematic Heritage Foundation.
We also know that the Council of Europe recently stressed the importance of building up our heritage.
We know very well that this cannot merely be achieved by conserving European films, but, as several of my fellow Members have already said, this comes from providing education on the diversity of European works and on what European works represent for future generations.
I therefore attach great importance to the issue of heritage.
To sum up, I would like to stress one important point, that of new technologies.
New technologies are instruments for the circulation of many things, such as information, knowledge, and cinema.
New technologies have their own linguistic facilities which could be of valuable help in circulating European films.
I shall therefore stress the opportunities that this report could provide in this area.
I have emphasised this issue in my report on the Sixth Framework Programme that we will be voting on in a few days.
However, I believe that new technologies, research into new technologies and digitalisation are all important.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work.
This document gives a clear picture of the difficulties European cinema has been striving painfully to overcome for many years now.
I would like to focus briefly on two of the many points contained in the motion for a resolution which caught my attention.
Firstly, I fully support the call for the funds made available to the film-making industry to be increased.
In effect, considering that the cinema has become an important part of our cultural heritage - cinemas have been more popular than bookshops for many years now in Europe - and given the high potential for employment in this sector, there is no doubt that greater Community financial aid would facilitate its development.
And this is precisely one of the problematic areas.
Without incentives and investment, there is no growth or impetus, and there is no quality either.
Europe has been overrun with film productions which are foreign to our cultural identity and often of dubious quality for too long now.
That is not to question the existence of the opportunity or rather the need for cinema to encourage awareness of diversities, of course, but I do feel that Europe needs to protect and encourage its own film heritage.
If, in addition, we consider the competition which came from television during the 1970s, it is not hard to see why hundreds, thousands of cinemas have been closed for so long.
Secondly, I fully support item 18, which refers explicitly to the restoration and protection of the European film heritage.
We do indeed need to encourage public institutions, local authorities and cultural associations to search for old and short films and to restore film material, thus ensuring that they are preserved and are available to the public.
There are very few film libraries in Europe which are worthy of that name and genuinely properly equipped and efficient.
They often suffer from miserly public contributions from the governments of the Member States.
Well then, the European Union cannot remain insensitive to this additional urgent need if we genuinely want to preserve the past heritage and guarantee the future of cinema.
Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report.
He sums up very clearly to what an extent the success of a product, film in this instance, is dependent on the promotion of sales through marketing and advertising.
When American production companies set aside 30% of their budgets for marketing, it is not to be wondered at that European products lose in direct competition for customers, when they themselves use only 3 to 6% of their budgets for this purpose.
It follows that European film producers must do more to market their products.
We, as taxpayers, are also entitled to demand that they do so.
One could envisage state support for follow-up projects being made dependent on the filmmakers' efforts at reaching their public.
More subsidies cannot be the solution on their own.
Too much money was spent in the past on films that never reached their public.
Austria spends over EUR 30 million per annum on promoting films.
Taking the number of cinema-goers into account, every ticket to see a film is subsidised to the tune of EUR 1 000.
State promotion of film cannot have this as its objective.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start by thanking not only the rapporteur for this initiative, as all of you have done, but also the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which has backed his initiative so strongly.
As you may know, the latest Europacinema conference began here in Strasbourg last weekend, and it is continuing through today and tomorrow.
The final panel discussion will be taking place in our rooms tomorrow.
There have been many discussions and many problems to resolve, such as: What is the problem, why is there no internal European market?
In discussing many specific problems, whether to do with nation-states or the subsidy issue, we came up against the same point over and over again, that the distribution system does not work.
We have a European internal market, but it is not accepted that this product, film, can really circulate.
It is at this hurdle that we fall.
Now as always, there is a national logic to film promotion, which also applies to a film's success: if it was not a box-office success at home, it will not be an international one either.
I have to agree with Mr Sichrovsky that an increase in subsidies would not help, but an increased subsidy from the country we both come from would help the market a bit.
It would be wrong to demand that producers should take greater risks.
There are no independent producers.
First, we must promote this market economically, we must engage in business development, so that this market can emerge at all.
Here, too, one of the demands the Culture Committee makes over and over again in many contexts would seem to be appropriate here.
We must endeavour to make business development, whether it originates from large or small enterprises, tax-deductible.
We will support this report not only for reasons of ideology, but also out of wholehearted conviction.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Vander Taelen for the excellent work he has done and for his constructive approach to this report.
Today, we find ourselves faced with a terrible paradox.
Europe produces more films than the United States, and these are often of a very high quality, but the market share of European films has never been this low before, it stands at 22%, whereas films from the United States take 73.7% of the European market.
Furthermore, European films secure only 26% of their box office takings from sources outside the country where they were produced.
These are just some observations.
This is a good report because it does not limit itself to providing an analysis of how things stand.
It tackles the very reasons why the European film industry is weak, namely, its capacity for development and distribution.
In order to render the European film industry more competitive, the rapporteur makes very specific proposals which, in my view, are excellent.
Of course, and I agree with him, we must urgently adopt an ambitious multiannual plan to improve the competitiveness of the European film industry and to strengthen the transnational distribution structures for European films.
We must develop research into digital film distribution and projection techniques; we must promote the creation of a European Heritage Foundation and perform a feasibility study of 'interconnecting' support funds of Member States so as to increase the sources of financing.
Of course, when revising the 'Television Without Frontiers' Directive, we must ensure that we include a requirement for television broadcasters to invest a certain amount in the European film industry, and the obligation to promote and broadcast European films.
This should also be an opportunity for Member States, which do not yet benefit from them, to consider the appropriate fiscal incentives.
I therefore hope that the Commission, as well as the Council, understand the challenges we are faced with, and that they take appropriate action.
Today, we are debating something that is not only a major challenge in terms of the economy, but also something that is an integral part of the European Union, in other words, culture, creation and identity.
That is why this is so urgent.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like the House to know how pleased I am that the Committee which I have the honour of chairing has unanimously, and rightly so, adopted the detailed, comprehensive report of the rapporteur, Mr Vander Taelen.
Without going back over aspects which have already been debated, I would point out here that the rapporteur has provided comprehensive proof, as I said before, that both a cultural problem and an organisational problem exist. The problems are related.
I feel that the measure tabled by the committee and the decision the House makes tomorrow are so important as to warrant due reflection from the Commissioner and, indeed, a number of proposals and initiatives as well.
As we have said before and will continue to say, there needs to be a substantial cultural element in the integration of Europe, and films play a major, fundamental role in both informing people about cultural diversities and providing authenticity, allowing the message of cinema to be disseminated in all the States.
There is a need for more than just organisation.
That is important and, in my opinion, the report certainly raises basic issues which will lead us to greater organisation and investment than in the past.
What Mrs Sanders-ten Holte said just now is important.
If European film production increases, the number of distribution channels will have to increase too.
That is why the problems are related, and it is therefore our task, our responsibility, the responsibility of Parliament, especially, and of the Commission, in particular, and the Council, to achieve this.
There is nothing we can do to change the current structure of the industry.
When we debate television without frontiers, then we will be able to establish rights and clear guidelines; we will be able to require television companies to distribute, promote and commission European films, but it is imperative that, in cultural terms, we realise that we must make it quite clear that all the European countries must be able to benefit from films.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my colleague, Viviane Reding, was unable to join us for this debate because she is in Brussels at the Council meeting of sports ministers, but she asked me to pass on her thanks to Mr Vander Taelen for his excellent report.
This initiative shows that the European Parliament is fully aware of the strategic importance, both economic and cultural, of the European film industry, but also of what hampers the circulation of films and other audiovisual works in the internal market and candidate countries, as several Members have pointed out.
The European Commission, which fully supports the report' s objectives, welcomes its adoption.
The Commission is also pleased that our two institutions share the same viewpoint regarding the need to pursue an ambitious European policy in order to make the European audiovisual industry more competitive.
Several recent initiatives by the Commission in this area are proof of this common approach.
As you are more than aware, the recent Commission communication on certain legal aspects related to cinematographic and other audiovisual works that my colleague, Viviane Reding, presented to the Council on 5 November, tackles the issues of the circulation of E-cinema, the tax regime applied to the industry, the protection of European audiovisual heritage, the classification of works and other problems affecting the circulation of films and other audiovisual works.
The implementation of the measures set out in this communication, combined with the application of the MEDIA Plus programme (2001-2005) and the joint initiative undertaken by the Commission and the European Investment Bank, i2i Audiovisual, should help to significantly improve the situation of European films.
If I may, Mr President, I would like to come back to some points of the motion for a resolution which has been submitted to you.
With regard to the measures that are currently being undertaken, the second point of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission to pursue a consistent Community policy on the film industry, particularly as regards the application of its competition policy.
The above-mentioned communication provides the film industry with increased legal certainty by specifying, as part of a constructive and positive approach, the criteria used by the Commission when assessing national support schemes for the film sector under the Treaty' s rules on State funding.
To date, all the national schemes reviewed on this basis have been accepted by the Commission.
Item 5 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission, in implementing MEDIA Plus, to draw attention to the Europa Cinemas network of cinemas, and item 6 calls on the Commission to support the 'Shooting Stars' initiative of the organisation European Film Promotion.
These projects are undeniably of value and have received Community support for several years as part of the MEDIA programme.
However, it is important to point out that the actions under the MEDIA programme are subject to calls for proposals and to the principle of fair competition and project selection according to a transparent procedure.
Item 7 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission, when revising the directive, to investigate the desirability and feasibility of imposing new quotas on broadcasters.
The Commission has already launched, pursuant to Article 25(a) of the directive, an independent study to assess the impact of measures for promoting the production and distribution of European television programmes.
This study will also assess, more specifically, the effectiveness of quotas laid down under the directive, compared to other support measures.
Furthermore, at the beginning of 2002, the Commission will undertake a public consultation on this subject.
It will urge all the parties concerned to submit written comments.
The results of the various studies and of the public consultation will provide a significant contribution to the communication on the review of the directive and any proposals for amendments, which the Commission plans to submit to the Council and to the European Parliament towards the end of 2002.
Item 33 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission to consider introducing specific European regulations in order to stimulate the development of the film industry in the candidate countries.
This central concern is taken into account as part of the external action of the European audiovisual policy under the heading of enlargement.
Candidate countries are therefore obliged to respect the 'acquis communautaire' where the audiovisual sector is concerned.
As you know, this mainly concerns the 'Television Without Frontiers' Directive.
In addition, they will be able to take part in the MEDIA programme as soon as they have reached a high degree of compatibility with the 'acquis communautaire' .
Furthermore, nine candidate countries were asked to take part in the MEDIA Plus programme.
The aim is for these countries to participate from the beginning of 2002.
Item 26 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission to perform a feasibility study of the possibility of 'interconnecting' the existing automatic support funds of the Member States and regions.
It must be reiterated that an assessment was already carried out in 1998 in Birmingham, by the 'Club des Producteurs Européens' .
The working group associated with the Commission came to the following conclusion: the proposed mechanism would, in practice, exclude many Member States who have no automatic support system for production.
As a result, the automatic support funds of the smaller countries would be drained by the more commercially successful countries, in other words, the main producing countries.
Item 27 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Committee to perform a feasibility study of the possibility of setting up a European Promotion Fund.
Council Decision No 2000/821/EC establishing the MEDIA Plus programme already, in its 'Promotion' section, lays down support for promotional activities in favour of European creation, in other words, approximately 8% of the budget.
Lastly, the Commission welcomes the amendment, which was tabled in plenary by the rapporteur, to set up an implementing agency.
The Commission will inform the rapporteur and Parliament about its proposal on this issue.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these are the Commission' s comments on the report by Mr Vander Taelen, who I would again like to thank.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Protection of animals during transport
Mr President, I should also like to welcome Commissioner Byrne, who could play a significant role in this field.
A great deal needs to be said about the implementation of Directive 95/29/EC and animal transport.
The lack of adequate supervision, carriers who are slapdash at times and abuse during the export of animals for slaughter outside the EU give rise to much commotion.
In addition, the unlimited transport of animals for slaughter by the EU has made a compelling contribution to the spread of animal diseases, including foot-and-mouth and swine fever.
It is striking that the effects of this are more or less entirely shouldered by the animal farmers.
Abuse during transport and the spreading of animal diseases directly impact on the image, and often the income, of animal farmers, while they are not to blame for these causes.
Consequently, anyone who wants to adopt a pro-active stance in the fight against animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth and swine fever, anyone who is concerned about the difficult position European animal farmers are already in, or anyone who cares about animal welfare, will not put up with a culture of tolerance and chaotic rules for animal transport.
The fact that Parliament has decided to present an initiative proposal to tighten these directives now sends a strong political signal to the Council and the Commission.
After all, next month, the Council will be holding a conference on the European vaccination policy, and in this report, an initial proposal is made for effective prevention of infectious diseases.
Additionally, the Commission will soon table proposals to tighten the rules for animal transport.
This report also reflects Parliament' s great displeasure at the implementation of existing legislation by the Member States and the Commission' s lack of opportunity to notify Member States.
This report mainly aims to identify the key conditions which sound legislation on animal transport must meet.
First of all, there is supervision.
The supervision of animal transport in the European Union must be tailored to European needs by taking the following measures.
First of all, 15 EU inspectors should be appointed with the task of submitting annual reports to the Council, the Commission, but also the European Parliament, as well as the parliaments of the Member States.
Secondly, adequate regulations must be put in place for sanctions, both financial and in terms of licences.
The third point concerns the introduction of an adequate European licensing scheme for carriers of animals.
I should like to make the following observations with regard to transport times.
We propose to limit the duration of the transport of animals for slaughter and productive livestock to four hours, or 250 km, with a possible extension to eight hours, provided that the carrier is licensed and the animals can lie down and have a supply of fresh water.
As for animals intended for breeding and sporting purposes, we suggest a transport duration of two 24-hour legs by specialist carriers, provided that the animals have a supply of fresh water and feed.
With regard to possible exceptions, I should like to draw your attention to two problems.
The Commission may grant exemption for areas with few or no slaughterhouses by increasing the said distances and durations by up to 50%.
For small islands, but also for Ireland, and I wish to make a point of highlighting Ireland, transport by ship is subject to a separate arrangement.
Furthermore, the said regions are disproportionately hit by tightened European legislation on food safety, and I would therefore suggest earmarking structural funds for those regions to invest in small, semi-mobile slaughterhouses.
The export refunds for the export of live animals for slaughter should be stopped as soon as possible, but that is only possible if an international discussion is held about the transport of animals for slaughter and by adding this item to the agenda.
With regard to the amendments, I should like to comment as follows.
Together with the Liberal Group and the Socialist Group, I have tabled three amendments to enhance the report' s practical implementability.
These concern Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 6, which deal, among other things, with temperature, but also a number of other practical points.
I should like to express thanks to Mr Heinz Kindermann and Mr Neil Busk for their very constructive cooperation.
As far as I am concerned, the report could also have been referred to as the Maat-Busk-Kindermann report.
I assume that the Liberal Group will withdraw Amendment No 3 as it is identical to the joint amendment tabled by the PPE-DE, the PSE and the ELDR.
The policy of tolerance and the feel-good factor surrounding the transport of animals must be brought to a halt.
In the EU, literally millions of animals have been killed and destroyed in the last four years as a result of an explosive spreading of animal diseases including foot-and-mouth and swine fever.
Abuse during animal transport and the shocking images of this are an indictment of European culture of which caring about animals and the countryside form an essential part.
The sad truth is that in every single case, it is the animal farmer who ends up footing the bill at a time when meat prices are unacceptably low and consumer prices remain at an all-time high.
Commission and Council, it is time for action, time to choose in favour of the quality of our animals and our countryside.
Mr President, on behalf of the Environment Committee, I welcome Mr Maat's excellent report.
It does not go as far as the Environment Committee would have wished, particularly in relation to the duration of travel - the Environment Committee would have preferred four hours - however, if eight hours is complied with, it will be a really welcome advance in animal welfare.
This is the first realistic report on animal welfare, Mr Maat has done an excellent job and I congratulate him.
My group supports this report.
Although the report does not go far enough in relation to the eight hours, paragraph 1 is extremely important.
The maximum journey time of eight hours for slaughter and for further fattening should be welcomed because animals were being transported long distances over long periods in completely unacceptable conditions.
Another important paragraph is paragraph 20, which calls for an end to the payment of export refunds on the export of live animals to third countries for slaughter.
This is long overdue.
The vast majority of European taxpayers are against the idea of their taxes being used to fund something that they fundamentally disagree with.
The onus is on the Commission to ensure that Member States comply with the rules.
The Commission must take very strong action against any Member States which do not comply.
They must be taken to court and fined.
In relation to the reduced need for long transport, it is extremely important to promote local abattoirs and also the trade in meat.
It makes much more economic sense to have a trade in meat than a trade in live animals, because jobs are then created within the EU.
The same applies to Ireland: it could make a lot more exporting meat than live animals.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start by expressing my thanks to Mr Maat.
I think he has approached this subject in a very realistic way, many years of discussions on animal transport mean that, in my view, an emotional approach is no more use to us.
Nobody, when talking about animal transport, means the kitten in the hand luggage on an aircraft, and nobody mentions the little dog on a lead on the Intercity train and certainly not the racehorse in its specialised horsebox on the motorway.
No, in the Maat report we are discussing the well-being of animals on their way to be slaughtered.
Now, I have been in this House for a very long time, and so it is to the Commissioner that I am speaking when I say this: On paper, or so it seems to me, we have produced variations on this theme for years, and we have been constantly demanding more.
All the same, we are still repeatedly shocked by the often intolerable situations revealed in individual cases by the checks, which are far too few and far between.
Better transport conditions are wanted not only, indeed, by campaigners against cruelty to animals, but also by producers and consumers.
In reports and amendments, we demand expert staff, purpose-built vehicles with adequate space for the animals to lie down in, ventilation, supplies of food and water and, for animals for slaughter, journey times limited to a maximum of eight hours.
The proposal to end the payment of export refunds for live animals is one which I find quite crucial and also particularly deserving of support.
There are objections to this, amounting in the final analysis to this being an interference with the market.
Even Jewish ritual slaughter is brought into the argument.
I could smile a little at that, for even that is now possible in the EU.
It would be better to transport the meat afterwards.
Commissioner, I find that a person's weak spot is very often his or her wallet or purse.
More inspection, more controls, high penalties and loss of the licence where offences are found to have been committed, these would bring about more effective improvements for us all.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report of the Committee on the Transport of Animals, which is under discussion this evening, has borne out what is repeatedly seen on television: the brutal way that animals are treated, the disregard of limits on journey times, the overloading of vehicles and many other breaches of current regulations on the transport of animals, none of which has been an infrequent occurrence.
This situation is no longer tolerable, and the European public is right to demand speedy measures to remedy it.
I must, though, say quite clearly that European regulations on the transport of animals, when correctly enforced, already guarantee a high degree of protection to animals.
As the Committee highlights in its report, the fundamental problem is that the regulations currently in force are applied only very inadequately in most of the Member States.
Quite apart from the difficulty of transposing the directive into national law, this is attributable above all to Member States' defective control procedures and the far too weak sanctions imposed when breaches are discovered.
Criticism arising out of these problems should therefore be directed mainly at the Member States.
In my opinion, the Community control policy needs a thorough re-think here, as comparable problems exist in other areas of veterinary control.
I would like, though, to enlarge on two further points.
The abolition of export refunds for animals for slaughter, contained in this resolution, was decided on by Parliament in the course of the 2002 Budget procedure and has long been demanded by Social Democrats.
In the past, Parliament has already given financially preferential treatment to meat as opposed to livestock for slaughter in paying export refunds, in order to remove the economic incentive from the export of live animals.
At present, then, only about one-half in export refund is paid for livestock in comparison with meat.
Even that, though, is not yet enough, and export refunds for animals for slaughter should be reduced to zero.
The other point I would like to make is that the proposal for a resolution calls for a maximum transport time of 8 hours for animals intended for slaughter, and that, too, is an old demand from the Social Democrats.
There is to be no general maximum journey time, and prime consideration was given to the situation of remote regions and islands.
Here, too, there will be limited exceptions to the rules on maximum journey time, which we greatly welcome.
In conclusion, I would like, on behalf of the Social Democrat Group, to thank Mr Maat for the constructive work we have done together, and I believe it will continue in future.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin by thanking Mr Maat for his excellent cooperation in connection with this report.
Partly in conjunction with Mr Kindermann, we have prepared quite a few amendments, and this has, in my view, turned out to be an excellent report.
I should also like to thank the Commission which, without hiding anything, has clearly described how the Member States have implemented or, more to the point, failed at all to implement, the many decisions taken in 1991 and 1995.
It is really frightening to see how European ministers sit and take joint decisions about something as important as animal welfare and the transport of animals under satisfactory conditions.
They then travel home and totally forget what they have been involved in deciding, that is to say they do not transpose any of these decisions into national legislation.
We could have well done without the huge number of hideous television pictures we have seen of animals suffering in a wide range of appalling situations.
Lorries have been opened, to reveal dead animals inside, with other animals trampling upon them.
That situation is simply unacceptable, and it must be brought to an end now.
It is therefore time to put a stop to our traditional practices of many years in the EU whereby animals are transported from north to south and from east to west.
There is no good reason for doing this.
Animals suffer as a result, and the call must now go out for animals to be slaughtered at the nearest abattoir.
Obviously, we are also obliged to transport animals for breeding purposes from areas which excel in producing such animals to areas which have a need for new animals of this kind.
I therefore look forward to the Commission' s now tabling proposals for common regulations governing the transport of animals, and I repeat: these must not be minimum regulations, but common regulations governing the transport of animals.
Mr President, I welcome this report and would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work.
However, I would first of all like to highlight my concern that the current debate has consistently failed to acknowledge the failure of many Member States to implement existing Community legislation in this area.
The latest Commission report, together with numerous mission reports, has highlighted that there is a serious disregard of animal welfare in some countries.
The Commission must show a much greater willingness to initiate infringement proceedings against Member States which fail to enforce this directive properly.
With respect to journey times, I hope the Commission will follow the recommendations of their scientific advisory committees and propose workable limits that allow businesses to function effectively, whilst maintaining a high standard of animal welfare.
I will be supporting the 8-hour or 500-kilometre limit, and strongly support the view that the climate conditions of each Member State should also be taken into consideration.
However, in areas where these journey times are unrealistic, a temporary dispensation to the maximum 8-hour travelling time should be granted where there are no slaughterhouses within a radius of 500 kilometres.
I am thinking particularly, in the UK, of the islands of Western Scotland, and of other parts of the European Union that are affected adversely in that regard.
Although putting a limit on journey times is an important step forward, the treatment of animals en route, vehicle ventilation, overcrowding, and the definition of space and temperature requirements during transport etc. are equally important issues.
The recent foot-and-mouth crisis provided evidence enough that the unnecessary long-distance transport of animals was a factor in the quick spread of that disease.
I look forward to the Commission's policy plan scheduled for 1 January 2003 aimed at the regionalisation of meat production chains, so as to limit the long-distance transport of live animals in future.
Mr President, the report on the protection of animals during transport has evoked great public interest.
Various associations, but above all individual citizens, have watched attentively to see what steps, if any, Parliament will take to prohibit intolerable conditions in the transport of animals.
The report's concern is with the use of legislation to prevent animals in transit from being endangered or brought to a cruel demise.
Nothing, though, must be left to chance, but there must rather be firm negotiations when the report is elaborated.
Among the European rural model's special features, the expectations of society are a decisive element.
The BSE crisis and the consequences of the destruction of animals due to the foot-and-mouth epidemic have put a definite question mark against what had so far been achieved.
An estimated 250 million farm animals a year are transported across the EU.
The people involved have for years vigorously disputed how necessary or pointless this is.
This basic regulation itself contains numerous practical and legal provisions on the transport of animals.
It is clear that national authorities do not act in the same way everywhere, which shows how weak the animal protection clause really is.
There is a lack of seriousness, transparency and honesty in this area.
If, for example, hares living wild in Poland are caught with nets and transported into the EU in containers that are torment to them, just so that people can shoot them for sport as a leisure pursuit, that has nothing to do with sport and even less with the protection of animals.
I would be happy if the Commissioner were able to say that it does not.
At this particular stage of negotiations on the enlargement of Europe, this incident bodes ill for well-regulated agronomy as the basis for protecting Europe's environment and species.
The report before us opts, in this sense, for cooperation rather than confrontation between agriculture and animal protection.
Mr President, animal transport has been put in a bad light by the many infringements which carriers have committed.
These infringements are an indication that, in addition to transport rules, additional attention must be devoted to supervising compliance with these rules.
In the past year, we have had to face yet another disastrous outcome of animal transport, namely the spread of animal diseases.
One now notorious incident of the transport of calves across different Member States cost the lives of 265 000 animals.
One of the conclusions we are drawing from the foot-and-mouth crisis is that agriculture must focus on the regionalisation of production and that the transport of live animals must come to an end.
With this in mind, I give my wholehearted support to the report by Mr Maat.
However, it is beyond me why in his amendments, he wishes to scrap the maximum and minimum temperature requirements inside the means of transport on the strength of the futile argument that everything is fine as long as the truck has mechanical ventilation.
Animal protection groupings will certainly find it difficult to accept this argument.
My amendments have the same objective as those by Mr Maat, except that mine still include the temperature requirements.
I support the call to end the payment of export refunds in respect of live animals for slaughter.
The evasion of European transport and slaughter rules by having animals slaughtered outside the Union under conditions which would be banned in Europe does injustice to the European farmers.
The Commission would like to encourage farmers to produce quality products.
Animal welfare forms an essential part of this quality which extends from farm to fork.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a report on a Commission report on the implementation of the directive concerning the protection of animals during transport.
Commissioner, once more in this Parliament we are giving in to the temptation to tell the Commission exactly what it should be presenting us with, in great detail, in the next proposals for a directive they submit to us, to the extent that we are practically doing their job for them.
The rapporteur, Mr Maat, has done a great piece of work.
I trust that the Commission and the Council will take this into account.
Animals must be transported in conditions that are reasonably good; legislation should dictate standards to ensure that this is the case, and the authorities should verify compliance with these standards.
Having said this, I would like to share two thoughts with you: firstly, that conditions should be the same for both long- and short-distance transportation.
We should not demonise the long-distance transportation of animals, because that would lead to distorted competition in the internal market.
And secondly, transportation conditions should also be the same for all animals that are transported, in cases where animals are being taken to the abattoir as in cases where animals are transported to be reared close to, or far away from, their place of birth, or in order to take part in a competition.
These issues are not raised in the report, and I, Commissioner, would personally like to see them included in the next Commission proposals.
On the other hand, I would like to applaud and thank the rapporteur, who put forward an amendment on behalf of my group to delete the references made to temperatures, for it makes no sense to talk about temperatures without also referring to the corresponding relative humidity.
Additionally, from Lapland to the Canary Islands, Europe is a very large continent with a very diverse climate, population density and socio-economic conditions.
Finally, I would like to draw your attention to the importance of transportation in the propagation of epizootic diseases.
This is never related to the length of the journey, but we should be absolutely rigid with regard to standards and compliance with them.
For example, the classical swine fever we had in Spain in 1997 was caused by piglets travelling from Holland.
This can and should be avoided.
Mr President, Mr Maat' s report is excellent and summarises the legitimate and powerful criticism that has to be directed, in the first place, against the Council of Ministers and the Member States.
It is disgraceful that those of us in a civilised and cultivated part of the world, calling itself Europe, should treat animals in the way we do.
Moreover, no one can convince me that it is economically necessary.
Presumably, it is economic madness.
I want first of all to deal with Paragraph 14.
Anyone who drives when drunk loses his driving licence immediately.
How can a driver arrive with a load including dead animals and yet retain both his driving licence and his licence to transport animals?
That is absurd!
Paragraph 20 is about ending the payment of export refunds in respect of live animals.
That is a first small step able, in actual fact, to be taken by the EU.
Mr President, Mr Maat's report is an important tool for thinking globally and acting more locally in agricultural and environmental policy.
Your report, Mr Maat, deserves our full support, as it does not make any compromises to the detriment of animal welfare and again emphatically brings to the light of day deficiencies which have long been well known.
There are particular expectations of the report since the vote in plenary which cut the budget for the export refund regulation.
The agreement with which this met naturally gives grounds for hope that the Maat report will be adopted as a whole, especially as it has made past misdemeanours in animal transport policy particularly apparent.
There are a number of points I would like to make, but time is too short.
Let me perhaps just say in conclusion that checks and supervision must be improved, and the amounts levied in fines must be harmonised and raised to a level that will act as a deterrent for transport businesses.
The same should apply to sanctions imposed on Member States.
We are all acquainted with the problems, the European public is right to be sharply critical of the European institutions and of the fifteen governments.
This report is to be highly valued also from the point of view of enlargement.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Council and of the Commission, it is high time that action were taken.
Mr President, it is probably indisputable that Europe-wide public opinion is demanding an immediate end to the animal cruelty associated with the transportation of live animals.
The EU has the means to reduce these problems, but lacks the political will to do so.
There exist directives whose purpose is to improve the conditions of animals during the time of transportation.
There is, however, no control over the implementation of these.
Mr Maat's report recognises this situation; it states that the directives issued on transportation are being violated.
It sees problems which arise from the different driving and resting times which apply to the drivers and to the animals being transported.
It pays particular attention to the export of live animals to countries outside the EU, which, of course, always involves the longest journey.
It reminds us that such transportations are a cause of the explosive spread of infectious animal diseases.
The most radical demand is that the Commission is being required to end payments of export aid with regard to animals being transported for slaughter, as from the start of next year.
The Commission must respond to these requirements (which will form the opinion of Parliament) in such a way that the ethical/moral demands of the civilised world regarding respect for life will, in the EU, also be met in the case of animals destined for slaughter.
Mr President, Ireland is committed to working with all Member States and international bodies to achieve higher standards in animal welfare.
Due to our peripheral location and our island status, as Mr Maat has recognised - for which I thank him - we have no realistic alternative to exporting our live cattle by boat, and we need to find export markets for nine out of the ten animals produced on our farms.
While I fully support the general principle of slaughtering animals as close as possible to the point of production, the reality is that many of the export markets available to us demand live animals rather than the processed products and for the foreseeable future the proper functioning of our market will require a balance between the dead meat and the live meat trade.
Regulation 615/98 links all payments of export refunds to compliance with strict animal welfare standards during transport, including full clinical examination of every animal.
We must police and enforce this fully.
The live export incident involving Germany and the Lebanon this summer resulted from the inexperience of the German authorities, as they are infrequent exporters of live animals and had no prior veterinary agreement with the Lebanese.
Hard cases make bad law.
I do not agree with the German agricultural minister's view that export refunds on live cattle can now no longer be justified.
If Europe does not fulfil the requirements of third countries, they will get their supplies from far further afield, with little or no controls and regulation from an animal welfare point of view since there are still no internationally agreed standards on transport.
We have to have the highest possible standards not just in the interest of the animals but also of the producers, who will get a far better price for healthy unstressed animals.
It is true that we must continue to review our standards of protection of animals during transport and each Member State must be willing to police and enforce the law.
However, with over a million tonnes of surplus beef in the EU, export refunds will be required for some time to come and I will not be supporting any proposal to remove them.
Mr President, Commissioner, it goes without saying that cruelty to animals must be stopped. This already forms the specific ethical basis of European agricultural production.
The Commission must have adequate powers to intervene in the activities of Member States; penalties must be sufficiently severe; and executive measures to correct these matters definitely need to be intensified.
I would like to thank Mr Maat, the rapporteur, for taking the exceptions into consideration.
There exist such things as sparsely populated areas, islands, and long distances, and these areas too must be able to function; in this report they have been taken into consideration in a balanced and even-handed way.
Animal welfare forms part of a greater whole.
The regionalisation of production chains has been the topic of the day and a theme for the future, and it is against this specific background that the aid for transportation of animals for slaughter must be ended.
This will further regionalisation, and the implementation and development of regional chains.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again, we are handling the subject of 'Protection of animals during transport' .
This is a long-running issue, and I unreservedly support the report Mr Maat has presented.
We all know that there are already several directives on this in the European Union, and legislation to transpose it in the Member States.
We are all in favour of comprehensive animal protection and opposed to methods of transport which inflict needless suffering, particularly on animals destined for slaughter.
Were all these positive laws to be transposed and followed up everywhere, this debate would not be necessary.
That is, however, not the case.
Pictures of unacceptable transport conditions provide repeated evidence of this.
We should, though, not lose sight of the fact that there are a few good things to report on this area.
There are some examples of the transportation of animals which already meet the requirements of animal protection.
The idea of slaughter in the immediate vicinity of the place of origin is also widely being put into practice.
Slaughter as close to the farm as possible is something I greatly support.
Modern methods of preservation make the export of meat even to distant areas thoroughly feasible.
We are right to demand feeding and watering breaks during the transportation of animals.
We will also have to give future consideration to how to minimise stress to the animals when being unloaded or reloaded before and after these breaks.
We could certainly aim to have the vehicles transporting animals to slaughter equipped in such a way that the animals could remain on board the vehicle during short breaks and be provided for there.
Transport, space, the way in which the vehicles are driven, ventilated and heated, loading and unloading procedures have, if they are made suitable, the greatest effect on improving the protection of animals.
This report makes its contribution to that and I ask for it to be supported across this House.
Mr President, during animal transport, animals are merely considered commodities and not living creatures with an intrinsic value.
The Member States should hang their heads in shame for the fact that the supervision of compliance with legislation is so deficient.
I therefore welcome the proposals to step up the supervisory procedures considerably and to tighten the sanctions.
Furthermore, a general time and distance limit should be imposed and far stricter requirements should be prescribed for all trucks.
Improved facilities should not be an alibi for extending driving times under the guise that it is acceptable for transport in 'business class' to take longer.
The use of 'business class' is quite ludicrous considering the sixth-rate treatment animals still receive before they are killed.
Live animals should only have to endure very short spells of transport.
Eight hours is indeed an improvement, but four hours should, in fact, be the absolute maximum.
We must move towards regionalisation of the production chain with small, clean slaughterhouses.
The recent foot-and-mouth crisis has illustrated once again that the stopping and collection places entail irresponsible animal-health risks, and these must therefore be abolished.
Reforms need to be carried out promptly with a view to enlargement.
Across Europe, animals should no longer simply be viewed as objects which are financially lucrative instead of as part of creation.
Mr Maat, many thanks for the sound report.
Mr President, it is a rare occurrence but, this time, I am forced to speak on behalf of my nation.
In fact, the entire Italian beef industry is extremely concerned by the proposal, and not just because of the maximum limits it imposes on travelling time.
Of even more concern to us is the fact that the proposal stipulates that animals for further fattening, which is a completely natural stage of the livestock rearing process, should be subject to the more restrictive measures laid down for animals for slaughter instead of the less restrictive measures laid down for breeding animals, even though the further fattening stage is a natural continuation of the livestock rearing process lasting a few months.
We fully understand the report' s objective, which is to replace the transportation of live animals with that of dead meat as far as possible.
However, our situation is quite out of the ordinary, involving 120 thousand farms and a flourishing processing industry with business activities ranging from slaughter to packing, which would be greatly compromised by such a measure.
Here are some statistics, Mr President, Commissioner: France has a cattle stock of over 20 million head and an annual slaughter rate of 5 million head; Italy has a cattle stock of 7 million head and an annual slaughter rate of 4.5 million head.
Clearly, this consolidated production cycle, which is vital for the economy of our country' s livestock sector, would be completely disrupted by the introduction of a maximum journey time or distance limit.
Moreover, there are no scientific grounds for such a limit and it would serve purely exploitative purposes and have consequences which, as I said, would be extremely difficult for the sector as a whole to bear.
It can be seen from this that the sole motive behind any proposal to place an absolute limit on travelling time is actually other countries' desire to strip Italy of a substantial part of its slaughter trade and to take the place of our producers in supplying beef and veal to the Italian market.
This is not the kind of Europe we want!
Mr President, I am pleased to outline to you the Commission's position on Mr Maat' s excellent report.
The subject matter of this report is animal welfare and animal transport in particular.
We all know that this is a very sensitive issue.
I made clear when I presented the original Commission proposal that the views of the Council and Parliament would help shape the proposals which I intend to present early next year.
The report under discussion here today shares most of the objectives of the Commission.
However, there is one key building block missing in the construction of the Commission' s final proposals and that is the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare, which is expected shortly.
This opinion will provide the Commission with the necessary scientific advice on key issues such as travelling times and loading densities.
On such issues, our actions must be guided by good scientific advice on animal transport conditions.
Let me nonetheless indicate some general impressions on some of the key issues raised in your report.
First of all on travelling time, I was very glad to note that some of the more extreme suggestions, such as a four-hour limit on animal transport, have not been supported in Mr Maat' s report.
The consistent advice to the Commission is that the stress and risk to animals in transport arises primarily from three factors: travelling time, loading and unloading of animals and the conditions in which they are transported - ventilation, humidity, density and so on.
The Commission has already presented proposals for improvements in these areas or will be presenting them shortly.
However there is too much emphasis in some quarters on travelling time.
I consider that a reduction to four hours is simplistic and takes no account of the wider interests involved.
We cannot ignore the interests of the farmers and the meat and livestock industry.
Such a reduction would be viewed as an attack on their livelihoods rather than a genuine contribution to animal welfare.
If we wish to retain their support for improved animal welfare then we must also respect their interests.
I wish to work with them rather than against them and hope that you share this view.
I would now like to turn to the issue of resources.
Your report calls for the number of inspectors in the Food and Veterinary Office engaged on animal welfare to be increased to fourteen, compared with the current figure of four.
The reality is that such an increase could only be achieved at the expense of other priorities, including BSE, foot-and-mouth disease, meat hygiene, residue levels and food safety generally, where the Commission is already over-stretched.
I have consistently refused to make promises on which I cannot deliver.
It would be dishonest to do so, both to this House and to the European public.
You stress the lack of enforcement of the current legislation in Member States.
I fully agree.
Member States must make the effort and provide the resources to ensure better implementation.
It is a point which I have made repeatedly to the Member States in the Agriculture Council.
Judging from the correspondence I receive from Members of Parliament, the best way to achieve better enforcement is through legal proceedings against the Member States.
However it should be pointed out that sometimes it is more effective to work with Member States than against them, so proceedings should be the last resort.
They are, after all, responsible for the on-the-ground implementation of Community legislation.
But let me be clear: where efforts to find solutions through dialogue do not succeed, the Commission will initiate infringement proceedings against the Member States concerned.
In fact, proceedings are under way against several Member States and are under consideration for several more.
Finally, in this respect, I would call on the House to assist the Commission' s efforts in encouraging Member States to take animal welfare more seriously.
In particular I would call on Members to remind your political colleagues in your own Member States of the need to put more efforts and resources into ensuring that the Community provisions on animal welfare are complied with.
Mr Maat, ladies and gentlemen, I will be returning to you shortly with the Commission' s formal proposals.
This will provide you with the opportunity to shape the hard legislation on animal welfare.
I can assure you that Mr Maat' s report will be a major influence on this legislation.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 9.40 p.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
The next item is the vote on requests for urgent procedure pursuant to Rule 112.
Proposal for a Council regulation aiming to promote the conversion of vessels and fishermen that were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Maroc [COM(2001) 384 - C5-0407/2001 - 2001/0163 (CNS)]
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last night the Committee on Fisheries approved the report by our colleague, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, on the restructuring of the Community fisheries sector affected by the non-renewal of the fisheries agreement with Morocco.
I would like to say to the House that this report is restricted to regulating the technical aspects relating to the social measures aimed at the many people affected; it is a very sensitive issue from a social, and therefore political, point of view, in the Member States affected by this restructuring.
Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in a position to ask the House to vote in favour of this request for an urgent procedure presented by the Council, so that this proposal can be debated in Council by the Fisheries Ministers at their meeting called for the 27 November.
Mr President, the Committee on Budgets is sympathetic to the needs of our friends in the Committee on Fisheries.
However, a conciliation meeting will be taking place on 21 November and it is not yet agreed between the different institutions how the agreement will be finalised, or indeed in what category it will be finalised.
In the light of a decision by the Budgets Council last week, there is a great deal of confusion on our side as to how we are going to deal with this.
I would ask that we do not treat this as urgent and that it be held over until after the conciliation meeting of 21 November.
Mr President, I wish to support Mr Wynn.
I am glad to see that the Committee on Budgets is taking a responsible approach to this issue because the idea of pushing it through as urgent procedure without debate is unacceptable.
We have to be very careful about how we use European taxpayers' money and we need to look to the future.
A number of years ago in this Parliament it was already being said that Morocco would not agree to another agreement with the EU.
We knew that then and we should have prepared for it.
This situation is not unique, it is going to happen again.
At the moment we are discussing a major agreement with Mauritania.
The day will come when Mauritania will say to the EU that it no longer wants such an agreement.
What are we going to do then?
We really need to address this issue, firstly, in relation to how we arrange our common fisheries policy and, secondly, in relation to how we use public money.
The way this has been rushed through is unacceptable.
This is not a matter for urgent procedure because we have known for many years that this problem was coming.
We need to be extremely careful about how we use European taxpayers' money.
I understand the problems the fishing community has, but we need to be more responsible.
Mr President, I would simply like to say that the Committee on Budgets has taken no decision in this field.
There are plenty of Members, particularly from my group, in the Committee on Budgets who believe that the urgent procedure is perfectly appropriate.
We understand the reasons that the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries has been able to give.
We believe that, in this case, a legal basis is necessary and, in any event, from the budgetary point of view, if it is necessary to amend that basis as a result of the negotiation with the Council on the 21 November, it could be done without any problem.
I therefore do not believe that this Parliament' s position would be damaged by accepting the urgent procedure today and voting on the Miguélez Ramos report, which, furthermore, relates much more to the technical issues in the Commission' s proposal with regard to the restructuring of the fleet than to actual budgetary motivations, which will be the subject of another report.
Mr President, I oppose urgency on a matter of principle, not on a matter of substance.
I am sure we all support a global health fund and President Prodi guaranteed EUR 120 million at the G8 meeting in July.
However, I and many others are extremely disappointed that the Commission has taken until November to come forward with any effective suggestions and now it is asking for urgency, effectively denying the Council and Parliament any time to debate or amend this proposal.
It looks as if we are just going to hand over a cheque and that will be the end of it.
The Commission is also suggesting the funding should be found by taking EUR 60 million from a fishing agreement and EUR 60 million from the EDF.
In its resolution in this House on 25 October this House emphasised that contributions should be new and additional funding, and this is not so.
At the moment it looks as if it is a one-off payment.
I would like to hear the Commission guarantee that a legal base will be found for the sustainable funding of the global health fund after 2000 and submitted as quickly as possible.
I would like an assurance that it will be new money and that Parliament and the Council will be kept fully informed and involved, so that we play a legislative part in this process.
We, as parliamentarians, cannot be treated in this way.
Mr President, there is no point in talking about old money or new money when there is no money!
If we do not get agreement on this matter this year with urgent procedure, there will be no money next year for the Global Health Fund.
I know there are problems about getting EUR 60 million from the EDF but, quite frankly, that is another argument.
If we want EUR 60 million from the general budget, we have to agree to using urgent procedure on this or there will be no money for the Global Health Fund.
This financing issue is indeed directly linked with the subject we were discussing just now.
EUR 50 million will be made available from appropriations that were previously earmarked for fishing agreements.
It is quite evident that this is additional money that was not available beforehand for other external actions.
A further EUR 10 million will be made available from two budget lines with which there have also been implementation difficulties up to now, that is to say the budget lines for Latin America and for Asia.
The money will be implemented here in a concrete way, and there are promising signs that the extra EUR 60 million can be provided from the EDF.
I believe that it really would be a good sign if the European Union could make an early decision on implementing these financial appropriations.
As you know, the donors to the global health fund have promised over USD 1.8 billion, but so far those are just promises.
The European Union would be the first to make a concrete decision on financing.
I therefore ask you to vote for this request for urgent procedure.
We need a legal basis for making a transfer to the global health fund.
This House will naturally be kept informed at all stages.
We will, of course, come back to this several times during the overall budget process.
But if the legal basis could be rapidly decided upon now, and it would be a good legal basis that would enable us to make the transfer, then we would not need to explore any other avenues, because the budget situation would be very clear.
So I ask you to vote for the request for urgent procedure.
Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I would like to say that we are against recourse to the urgent procedure, for fundamental and for procedural reasons.
The facts are as follows: the Commission has proposed a contribution of EUR 60 million to the Global Fund to fight AIDS/HIV, tuberculosis and malaria.
We are not against this proposal, but we do not believe that this can be a single contribution, made just once, if this objective is to be fulfilled.
We are arguing for a solid and sustained contribution, not just for one year.
This is why we do not agree with the urgent procedure; we intend to present amendments, which is our right in accordance with the codecision procedure applicable in this field.
The Commission, in asking for the urgent procedure, is doing so in a way which is unacceptable to Parliament, since it deprives us of this essential and irrevocable right.
The Commission announced its contribution to this fund in July; it told us about it some months ago and it announced it publicly in Genoa more than three months ago; and now it wants Parliament to express its opinion on this important issue in just one week.
Mr President, as rapporteur, allow me to explain.
We are talking, then, about three matters, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, together with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as discussed by the Committee on Budgets.
We support the Commission' s request for urgent procedure.
This is a matter of exceptional urgency, since many great needs have arisen, especially in Macedonia.
We are also concerned with extending the aid to Bosnia, Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
We nevertheless need a little more time.
To begin with, a proper discussion is needed in the Committee on Budgets. It is a question of transfers for this year and of budget issues for next year.
We need a little time in which to obtain the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and we need to have a discussion on the whole budget for the Balkans for 2002 in connection with the conciliation prior to the second reading of the budget next week.
We therefore propose voting to apply urgent procedure but also for deciding at the same time to deal with these three matters during the November II part-session in Brussels.
We should, then, be able to have a joint debate on the issues relating to the Balkans, at the same time as dealing with the Lagendijk report on the European Agency for Reconstruction.
Our proposal is therefore in favour of urgent procedure but also of debating the matter during the November II part-session in Brussels.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure) President.
That concludes the vote.
Presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report - 2000
The next item is the presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report for the year 2000.
Mr President, on behalf of the Members of the European Court of Auditors, I would like to thank you for inviting me to present the 24th Annual Report of the Court for the 2000 financial year.
As in previous years, this presentation marks the start of the discharge procedure.
The report follows the format used for the past three years, with chapters covering revenue and each of the expenditure areas under the headings of the financial perspectives.
There is an additional chapter this year which marks the development of the Union, which deals with pre-accession aid for which a separate financial perspective heading exists from 2000 onwards.
You will also - as usual - find a chapter dedicated to the Statement of Assurance and, attached to the report, you will find the Court' s observations on the implementation of the sixth, seventh and eight European Development Funds.
The different chapters of the Annual Report address four main concerns.
First, there is an analysis of the budgetary implementation and of the budgetary management practices for each specific financial perspective heading.
Then, you will find the follow-up of observations of the Court in previous Annual and Special Reports.
Thirdly, the specific appraisal in the context of the Statement of Assurance with information per financial perspective heading.
Finally, a new element this year is that the principal findings and recommendations in the Special Reports adopted by the Court since the last discharge are summarised in the chapters according to the wishes of this Parliament.
This means that the Annual Report this year contains all the principal findings and recommendations concerning the implementation of the general budget and the European Development Funds that the Court has published since the last discharge.
You will also find, for the first time - not in the copy of annual report that you have in your hands today, but in the Official Journal version that will come when the official version has been printed, something that Parliament has asked for many years - the text of the Court in one column and the answers of the Commission on the same page so as to make the report, at least in this respect, more user-friendly.
Concerning the budget management for 2000, one particular feature of budget implementation was the emergence of a very large surplus of revenue over expenditure, amounting to EUR 11.6 billion, equivalent to more than 14 % of final payment expenditure.
The main factors which led to this situation were a higher revenue yield than budgeted and - perhaps even more important - lower payments on Structural Measures, in particular those for the 2000-2006 programming period.
The Court recommends that the Commission examine how it can better use the supplementary and amending budget procedure to avoid excessive budget surpluses, in order to avoid distorted revenue positions for the following year caused by the carrying over of surpluses.
The Court, responding to the wishes of the discharge authority, has continued to follow up the observations in previous Annual and Special Reports.
The main purpose of this is to review what action has been taken, principally by the Commission, in response to the observations of the Court, the recommendations of the Council and the resolutions of the European Parliament.
In all of the subjects examined, some action has been taken. The extent and effectiveness of this action, however, vary considerably.
In general, the Commission, in particular where it agreed with the earlier observations and propositions, has adopted measures designed to respond to them and to improve the situation.
In some cases corrective action has been slow, in others, staff and financial resources allocated have been insufficient to achieve the desired level of improvement.
Effecting improvements in the management and control of complex programmes involving many organisations at different levels is difficult and takes time.
Structural rigidities have often to be overcome, and in the areas of shared or decentralised management, which account for more than 80 % of the general budget, the Commission requires action from others, such as Member States.
Notwithstanding that achieving change can be difficult, the Commission should ensure that it takes all the measures within its power to implement the recommendations of the Court and of this Parliament.
In early 2001, as part of its follow-up work, the Court reviewed progress in the replacement of the former anti-fraud unit (UCLAF) with the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF).
The new arrangements for OLAF provide a more appropriate administrative framework, with greater independence for the Office than its predecessor.
The Court continues to work closely with OLAF.
It has established formal procedures to ensure that the relations between the two organisations are efficient and effective.
It has also established a constructive dialogue with the committee established to supervise the work of OLAF, under the chairmanship of Prof. Delmas-Marty.
The Court has recently prepared an opinion, soon to be published, on a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the protection of the Community's financial interests.
This directive is an important step forward in the fight against fraud.
I would like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Court of Auditors for her impressive work and dedication over the years to make this important directive possible.
With regard to the Statement of Assurance, the Court is of the opinion that the revised accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2000 reflect reliably the Community' s revenue and expenditure for the year and the financial situation at the end of the year.
As far as the legality and regularity of underlying transactions are concerned, the audit of the principal management and control systems applicable to Agriculture and Structural Measures revealed weaknesses in the functioning of control procedures aiming to secure the legality and regularity of the transactions.
The audit of operational expenditure revealed an unacceptable incidence of error affecting the amount of the payments or the reality or the eligibility of the underlying transactions.
In view of the results of its audit work taken together, the Court is of the opinion that the transactions underlying the financial statements are, taken as a whole, legal and regular in respect of revenue, commitments and administrative expenditure but declines to provide this assurance in respect of payments in operational expenditure.
Since the last Annual Report the Court has adopted eighteen Special Reports to be taken into account in the discharge procedure, containing the results of audits which focus on a wide range of specific areas in which the Community' s financial management can be improved.
The results of the Court' s audits indicate significant positive findings.
In the agricultural area the reformed clearance of accounts system and the Integrated Administrative and Control System have contributed to improved management of large amounts of European Union funds.
The Commission' s strategy for dealing with BSE is basically sound.
With regard to Structural Measures, the URBAN Community Initiative has helped the implementation of many urban development projects and has enabled local authorities to access Union funds.
In the external actions area, the work of the agency charged with the reconstruction of Kosovo, was found to be both efficient and economical.
The TACIS cross-border co-operation programme is an instrument which has the potential to play a useful role in addressing issues relating to the new eastern border following the next accession.
However, it was also found that major objectives have either not been achieved, or only limited progress had been made.
Further, it was frequently found that there was either insufficient or no evaluation by the Commission of the achievement of the objectives.
The Commission' s reform programme is increasing the focus on results and performance measurement, within a resource allocation framework reflecting predetermined priorities and defined objectives.
The Court' s findings on recent programmes show that the Commission still faces major challenges in this area.
One of the most important issues in the discussion that we had last year here in Parliament, when I presented the Annual Report for 1999, concerned the situation in the Member States.
The results are striking.
The Court has concentrated a large share of its resources on the audit of control systems in Member States as a follow up to this debate.
Persistent weaknesses were found in Member States' checking of community operations concerning programmes where management is shared between the Commission and the Member States.
This was the case for the Integrated Administrative and Control System (IACS).
It was also the case for export refunds, and concerning the control regulation for Structural Measures.
Improving the control arrangements in the Member States is central to ensuring the correct use of Union funds.
It is also important if the Court is to place some reliance for its own audit purposes on the checks carried out by the various audit and supervisory services in the Commission, and in the Member States.
I will come back to this specific problem at the end of my speech.
The recast of the Financial Regulation, which is an important element of the Commission reform programme, maybe the first step that was taken, now seeks to clarify and strengthen the provisions relating to methods of implementation of the budget, advance payments, procurement, presentation of the accounts, and the offices.
The introduction of new provisions intended to contribute to the establishment of a coherent legal framework in the field of budgetary execution, based on the primacy of the Financial Regulation, is another important improvement within the recast.
However, as you will see from our Annual Report, some important matters of principle stated in the Court' s opinion on the proposed changes have not been followed, which may lead to serious complexity in financial management.
Regarding enlargement, this year' s Annual Report has a new chapter dealing with pre-accession aid for which a separate financial perspective heading exists from 2000 onwards.
In accordance with Parliament recommendations in its 1999 discharge resolution, the Court has been improving and intensifying the co-operation with the Supreme Audit Institutions of the candidate countries during the past few years.
Furthermore, in liaison with the Supreme Audit Institutions the Court has been intensifying the exchange of information at different levels of national administrations.
The setting-up of national systems of internal control and the external audit of EU funds made available to the candidate countries require closer co-operation between the institutions even before accession.
Enlargement will bring about changes in the way the Council, the Commission and the Court of Justice will work.
This is also true for the Court of Auditors and for Parliament.
Today, no one questions the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty to make the Court of Auditors one of the five independent institutions of the Union.
The Nice Treaty will mean substantial organisational changes in the near future, also for the European Court of Auditors, where the Court will have the possibility of establishing an organisational structure in chambers with a more effective decision making, even if we will then consist of 25 Member States.
The Court is actively preparing itself for this challenging reform.
The Court is developing its relations with the Commission' s new Internal Audit Service, with discussions covering a number of areas where we can work together.
The Court is giving high priority to assessing how it will be able to use the work of the Internal Audit Service and the audit capabilities in the Directorates General.
One very promising sign of progress in this field was the conference, under the challenging heading of "Verstehen" held at the initiative of the Internal Auditor, Mr Muis, on Thursday and Friday which Mrs Schreyer and Mrs Theato attended.
I should like to say, as the President of the Court of Auditors, that this initiative might mean an extremely fruitful, concrete and promising step forward in the idea of a single audit system concerning European funds.
The Treaty states clearly that the European Court of Auditors assists the European Parliament and the Council in exercising their powers of control over the implementation of the budget.
Ladies and Gentleman, I am soon to retire as President and Member of the European Court of Auditors.
During my seven years in the Court I have been privileged to contribute to the Court's growing importance, and to the continuous efforts it makes, in collaborating with Parliament and meeting its needs in optimising the assistance it provides.
The Court is addressing the need in its statement of assurance methodology for more information on the nature and causes of the problems affecting the management of Community funds by broadening the range of evidence in support of its conclusions.
The recent reforms in the area of financial management and internal audit will enable the Court to make greater use of the Commission' s work, not least for its work on the Statement of Assurance.
The Court intends to continue to develop specific appraisals for each major area of Community activity as a complement to its Statement of Assurance.
The specific appraisals are now envisaged in the Nice Treaty and are an important tool to help the discharge authority to make appropriate recommendations with a view to improving management.
One of the major tasks of the enlarged European Union will be the collaboration between European and National Supreme Audit Institutions.
This has long been a key preoccupation of this Parliament.
But, as we all know, this co-operation has advanced slowly and Parliament has repeatedly urged the Court to improve the situation.
After having followed progress for a number of years I have arrived at the conclusion that a good result in this respect requires initiatives at a higher level than purely technical co-operation between the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Member States and the European Court of Auditors.
I would like to quote a Member of this Parliament, Mr Jacques Santer who pointed out, when he was President of the Commission, the importance of collaboration between the national parliaments and the European Parliament.
It would also be a key factor in the field of Financial Control.
The Supreme Audit Institutions act independently and have a strong collaboration with their respective national parliaments.
So, collaboration between national parliaments and the European Parliament could have a major influence on national audit bodies and the European Court of Auditors, in particular in the matter of financial control.
The way of intergovernmental collaboration in this field is not the most practical route to take since the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Member States are, with the exception of my own country, independent of governments, as they are controlling them.
But maybe the solution can be found in increased cooperation between this Parliament and the national parliaments of the Member States.
Let me finally add one little word.
As parliamentarians in the European Parliament, as Commissioners in the European Commission, also as Auditors in the European Court of Auditors, we have a double role.
We have to fulfil our tasks according to the Treaty; to fulfil them as Commissioners, as Parliamentarians and as Members of the Court of Auditors.
But we also have another role in common. That is always to defend the idea of Europe.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr Karlsson, ladies, gentlemen, and members of the Court of Auditors, this report from the Court of Auditors on the 2000 budget year gives the Commission both encouragement and support; it is particularly supportive of the Commissioner for the Budget.
Let me thank the Court of Auditors, you, Mr Karlsson and the Court's members and staff for the 2000 Report and give especial additional thanks for the special reports, whose very practical recommendations make them very valuable to the Commission in its work.
I would most especially like to express my satisfaction with the Court's practical observations, and with the Court's support for two measures which are of particular concern to me.
One, in the area of foreign policy, has to do with the reconstruction of Kosovo.
The Court of Auditors has examined the accounting procedures and the profitability of the agency charged with the reconstruction of Kosovo and has come to a highly favourable conclusion, reporting that the agency has succeeded in achieving most of the high targets set for it, and that its administration and budget management were highly efficient economically.
I had strongly urged that the 2000 Budget should make available sufficient funds for the reconstruction of Kosovo.
Parliament and, in particular, Mr Bourlanges, whom I would like to mention particularly in his capacity as principal rapporteur on the 2000 Budget, were also very much behind the idea that sufficient funds should be allocated for this purpose.
The good work that was done meant that funds for the agency charged with the reconstruction of Kosovo could even be increased in the course of the 2000 budget year.
I am sure that Mr Bourlanges will feel, as I do, that it is quite simply very heartening when measures that one has been especially committed to get such a good report from the Court of Auditors.
It goes without saying that this sends an important message to the taxpayers, that money is being invested well in Kosovo, and in an economically efficient way.
I emphasise this for the additional reason that there is a very intense debate going on in the media about the common foreign and security policy, with people asking: where is the European Union? where is the Commission?
Here we have a quite tangible example of a common foreign policy measure and a tangible demonstration of what a good result can be achieved if we all pull together.
The second point about which I would like to speak personally, and on which I wish to express my thanks for the Court's support, is the Financial Regulation.
The recast of the Financial Regulation is a highly comprehensive undertaking, on which the Court of Auditors gave its opinion in quick order and was of great help to the Commission, not only with the adoption of a formal position, but also with the many meetings on technical and administrative matters.
That may perhaps sound a bit arid, but the fact is that the Financial Regulation lays down Budget procedures in exact terms, stipulating who plays what role, who possesses which supervisory powers and whether, for example, there can be rapid redeployments in the Budget, and where they can be made, in order to take account of changes during the budget year.
I am very grateful to the Court of Auditors for making clear how important it is that all financial arrangements in specified sectors conform to Budget principles, or principles of sound budgeting.
I am very grateful to you in this Parliament for the amendments you have proposed even before the summer recess.
I can say quite unequivocally and definitely that the recast proposal gained a great deal in terms of quality as a result.
For its part, the Commission has now done its homework; so too, on this point, has the Court of Auditors; and so too, to a quite broad extent in this area, has Parliament; I therefore believe it is actually high time for Parliament to formally take up its position, so that then the Council, too, can get its homework over and done with in a similarly short time.
Now I also want to consider some areas in which the Court made some highly critical comments.
One case in point is the way in which the Monitoring Regulation for the Structural Funds has been implemented.
It is the Member States who have primary responsibility for monitoring the legality of the use to which Structural Fund resources are put.
It is, however, equally true that the Commission bears overall responsibility for the implementation of the Budget and thus for checking that monitoring regulations are clearly framed and enforceable and that the state of affairs does not come to pass in which more or less any Member State can come up with its own interpretation of the monitoring regulations and act accordingly.
The complaint most frequently levelled at the Structural Funds by the Member States is that the monitoring procedures are so complicated.
This sometimes reaches the point where the conclusion is to say: 'In future, we will have the Structural Funds only as a sort of lump sum transfer.'
The Commission, though, does not, of course, support this as the way forward, and I assume that Parliament does not support it either.
For when funds go out of the European Budget, they do so in order to achieve definite objectives and not as a general settlement.
It is, of course, true that, if we want things to be that way in future, we will have to work at simplifying the regulation in question.
I join with the Court of Auditors in calling for a simpler scheme which, being more easily monitored, would lessen the likelihood of error.
'Complicated procedure' was also the criticism the Court of Auditors laid at the door of the Sapard programme of agricultural aid for the acceding countries.
This afternoon the Commission will be debating the progress reports on the enlargement process as a whole, of which financial control is a very important part, as is the assessment of what progress has been made in the acceding states and of what problems remain to be overcome.
Sapard, though, presents us with the problem of the over EUR 1 billion allocated for 2000 and 2001, of which in fact only EUR 16 million have so far been paid out.
I must accept the Court of Auditors' criticism of what is, of course, a very poor result.
This will also have to be discussed in the Commission, for the complicated procedure must not result in the funds ceasing to be used at all.
When dealing with precise controls in the acceding states, we must, then, find a balance, but not to the detriment of implementation.
Turning to the massive EUR 11.6 billion surplus in the 2000 Budget, the Court of Auditors has explained that a surplus should not be entered in the accounts for the following year, but should, if at all possible in the current budget year, allow the Member States to make reduced payments, which means that the Budget would then be adjusted downwards in the course of the year.
I work on the assumption that the Council and the Finance Ministers would surely give this a favourable reception, but that there has to be more careful consideration of what is the right way forward here.
Of last year's Budget surplus, over EUR 3 billion was the result of increased income, which itself was a consequence of last year's growth figures in fact turning out better than had at first been assumed.
It was, though, only in November that the official figures became available.
Of the surplus, several hundred million euro represent real savings in agriculture as a result of favourable market developments.
I see it as a very positive thing if we do not have to spend money, but whether that is actually the case will not be definitely known until the end of the year.
Those who legislated for the Structural Funds had indeed already foreseen the possible difficulties in implementing the programme in its first year, and it is for that reason that the Interinstitutional Agreement provides for the option of transferring funds to subsequent years.
Let me again make it clear that I do not see it in a negative light if, at the end of the year, or, as the Court has proposed, possibly during the current year, funds can be returned to the Member States due to the money not being required.
I am probably agreeing with certain comments made in this Parliament when I say that the distinction has to be drawn between the money not being needed in order to achieve a given objective, and the money not having been able to be used because of faulty budget management or shortcomings in administration.
That can be properly assessed only when we are no longer talking in the Budget procedure about how much money is being invested, but rather about what objectives we want to achieve.
In this context, I take on board the Court of Auditors' remarks on evaluation and on how important it is in a good Budget procedure.
The Court of Auditors has confirmed the regularity of the accounts, in other words, that the books are in good order, and also of the revenue side of the Budget.
It has also certified the reliability of the commitments and of the administrative outgoings.
It has, however, criticised the excessive incidence of errors in cash movements.
Has the Commission, then, made too few changes in 2000 in order to improve financial management?
Let me, on this point, refer to the Court of Auditors' statement that, in 2000, many steps towards reform had only just started to be taken, and that they will only gradually meet with success.
I cannot, at this juncture, list all the steps we have taken since then, but I will all the same highlight a few of them.
One example is in the personnel field.
Additions have been made to the total personnel complement for financial management, among other things by redeployment within the Commission to reinforce the financial units in the various Directorates-General, and Parliament has made additional posts available for 2001.
The selection procedure for these is at present in progress, and it will result in 250 candidates being put on a list to strengthen the financial and personnel management sectors.
I would like, in addition, to mention the steps we are taking in training and development.
The Commission's reforms as a whole have meant that there is definitely a greater need for training.
A total of 2 800 officials have already been trained in financial management by the Budget Directorate-General and another 1 700 will take part in courses of this sort in the next few months.
The technical assistance offices have also come in for a lot of criticism from us in the past.
There are 126 of them, and 93 will have had their contracts with us cancelled by the end of 2001.
I see this as an important point; it is something that has been achieved through pressure exerted by Parliament, and we will, for example, be continuing with decentralisation in the field of foreign affairs, in order to make greater use of local knowledge in implementing budget decisions.
This afternoon the Commission will be taking decisions about further new management systems and about the networking of national agencies.
A few weeks ago, we adopted a comprehensive package to improve personnel policy.
In the summer, I presented the report on the steps the Commission had either taken, or proposed to the legislature, to combat fraud, ranging from regulations on money laundering via customs measures through to the proposal for a European public prosecutor for financial offences.
There is much to do, but much has already been achieved.
The Commission is not only active in well over 100 States.
It also gives aid following natural catastrophes and gives humanitarian aid in crisis areas and war zones. It is active in many traditional fields, for example in aspects of agriculture, but it also makes funds available for many innovative projects suggested by Parliament.
This may sometimes involve large amounts totalling millions, but sometimes, too, relatively small sums of money.
We link up researchers and the results of their investigations, share in the financing of high-speed railway lines and of student exchange schemes.
This represents a truly broad spectrum of areas of expenditure, and there is nothing rigid about it.
The programmes change, the tasks change and the world changes, so we are all constantly being faced with new challenges, and all the European Union's institutions have to be open to them.
We want to create good European policies, which means learning from mistakes in order to make good measures even better.
The reports of the Court of Auditors are a fundamental support to us in doing this.
So I thank the Court, those of its members who are leaving, those who are continuing to be members of it, and most especially its President.
Mr Karlsson, your presidency has seen the further development of the method for the statement of assurance, and the compilation of a very large number of special reports containing very definite and valuable recommendations.
The understanding of financial management has improved under your presidency and so, I believe, has the institutions' understanding of each other.
For that you have my most especial thanks.
chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Karlsson, today you are presenting your annual report as President of the Court of Auditors, together with those Members of the Court still in office.
This is the last time you will present the report, as you are leaving office, as are a number of other Members of the Court. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and the retiring Members of the Court both personally and on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control for the years of excellent and effective cooperation and mutual trust under your presidency, and also under the previous presidency of Professor Friedmann, who is also retiring.
There have occasionally been differences of opinion, but I believe that we have always managed to cooperate well, and we have, above all, performed a control function that has ultimately benefited the taxpayer.
So once again, many thanks.
The Annual Report of the Court before us today also demonstrates that we have made some further progress.
I only want to highlight a couple of points.
The most striking point is the large surplus of own resources: EUR 11.6 million or over 14% of the budget has not been spent.
The finance ministers are, of course, delighted, as this means that they will have to pay less to the EU next year, but we in the Committee on Budgetary Control are concerned to know which of the objectives that we have set ourselves have not been achieved.
I believe that the Commission would be well advised - and I understand from the press that there will be surpluses again this year - to get to work on supplementary and rectifying budgets so that the money available is really spent on achieving objectives.
The complex and cumbersome nature of the legal framework and the extent of the controls therefore involved are also a matter of concern both for the Parliament and for the Court of Auditors, and, as Commissioner Schreyer has just said, for the Commission too.
We need to work to simplify things as a matter of urgency, so that the public can also obtain funding, rather than say, 'It is so complicated.
I do not want any money from the European Union' .
Controls need to be proportionate but also to be effective, to lead to positive outcomes and to have a preventive effect.
My last point is the positive statement of assurance, the SOA.
Anyone looking for concrete figures or percentages in relation to payments will be disappointed.
Once again, the Court has not mentioned any concrete figures.
This House had actually pressed for that.
The Court now wants to bring forward a refined method of producing this positive statement of assurance.
We are more than happy to cooperate on this, but we also have to look and analyse where errors are due to the Member States and where they are the Commission's responsibility.
The Commission is ultimately responsible, and it must accept this responsibility.
I would like to thank you once again, Mr Karlsson, for your excellent cooperation, and I would like to wish all the retiring Members and you personally all the best for the future.
Mr President, I would also like to pass on my best regards to Mr Karlsson, thank him for his presentation and all the work he has done over the past few years.
I hope he will pass on our thanks to his other colleagues who are also leaving.
We must remember that this report is the first report which assesses the first full year of the Prodi Commission - a Commission which, let us remind ourselves, was appointed with the specific remit of radical overhaul and reform of the European Union.
The question we will be asking in our discharge procedure this year is: "Is the Commission delivering on that promise?".
Let us be clear.
If it is not, then the credibility of both the Prodi Commission and of this Parliament is on the line.
It is much too early to assess the success or failure of the Prodi Commission and of Commission reform.
The only question we can ask at this point is whether we are headed in the right direction.
Mr Karlsson, I noted your words last night.
There are a number of hopeful signs in this report.
So, where the Commission has specific responsibility, we do seem to be seeing some positive developments.
As you say, the strategy on BSE is basically sound.
The work of the Agency charged with the reconstruction of Kosovo was efficient and economical.
The reform programme is heading in the right direction.
You have approved the recasting of the financial regulation and the Commission's proposals on financial incentives for top grade officials, although I note that you have some concerns about the Commission's accounting mechanisms.
Perhaps Mrs Schreyer could comment on that.
We are not going to let the Commission off the hook.
There is a large area where the Commission has joint responsibility with the Member States, particularly in the agricultural sector and the structural funds.
The primary responsibility must lie with the Member States.
They are responsible for 85% of the budget.
Here we see some serious structural weaknesses.
In the structural funds, we see problems in the application of regulations at every level.
The CAP accounts for over 40% of the budget and where Member States are responsible there is no improvement.
Heads of stock continue be overstated.
We know that Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands have not signed the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests.
We are disappointed, Mr Karlsson, that you did not mention them by name in the report.
Again the Court has failed to give a statement of assurance to the Commission.
As I said last night, this is a complicated and ever-changing procedure and I do not believe the Commission will ever get a statement of assurance.
So the main message, as far as I can see, is that the Commission should keep going.
It is on the right track.
Member States must stop hiding behind the Commission and assume their proper responsibility of protecting EU taxpayers' money.
I too should like to express my appreciation for all the Members of the Court of Auditors who are departing.
It is noticeable again that this year, as the Court of Auditors has already expressed in rather vague terms, there is no Statement of Assurance.
The question arises as to how long this situation can continue like this.
2001 is the first year for which the current Commission shoulders all responsibility.
In my opinion, there should come a day when a positive Statement of Assurance can be made.
I should like to suggest that the Commission sets the year 2000 as a target date.
For each year, an action plan should be drafted in which the Commission outlines its objectives.
We must ensure that the necessary arrangements are then in place for certain Directorates-General, with a margin of error of, say, less than 1%.
As far as the Member States are concerned, we all know that that is where the money is spent.
In my view, the system we are currently using for the agricultural funds is workable: if a Member State spends certain amounts inappropriately, the Commission will need to introduce capping.
I should like to see the Commission make proposals for extending this system to include other sectors of the budget, notably the Structural Funds.
Honourable Members of the Court of Auditors, Mr Karlsson, Mrs Schreyer, on behalf of my group, I should naturally like to echo the words of thanks which my fellow MEPs have already expressed.
I have started to wade through this tome.
I have to admit that this 24th Annual Report seems superior and that more names are included than before.
In other words, this Annual Report is simply a better read, it has to be said.
It also becomes clear that you are sending out a message, namely an urgent request for simplifying legislation.
Indeed, if legislation were simplified, fewer mistakes would be made, fewer irregularities would occur and this would probably result in less fraud.
When I read what was happening with the own resources and when I saw the results of the database, which gives an overview of all cases of fraud and irregularities established since 1996, amounting to EUR 1.5 billion, I appreciated the significance of what we are doing. On the basis of the Court of Auditors report, the OLAF reports, the work carried out by the rapporteurs and also our own studies, we will need to explain to the European taxpayers how their money is being spent.
I am delighted with the fact that the Annual Report devotes much attention to the role of the Member States.
Indeed, they do not sufficiently inspect the Community programmes which they manage in conjunction with the Commission.
Neither do they fight fraud satisfactorily when they collect their revenue.
The VAT carrousels are a prime example of this.
Finally, as Mrs Morgan has already stated, the Member States fail to implement legislation adequately.
In this connection, I should once again like to haul my own country over the coals.
In the Blak report, Belgium was attacked for not yet having ratified the 1995 agreement.
I have exchanged correspondence in this respect with the President of the Belgian Parliament, and four months ago, I was promised that this agreement would be ratified during the Belgian Presidency.
That has not been done to date.
That is an outright scandal, and I am grateful to the Court of Auditors for once again giving us the necessary ammunition today to ensure that the Belgian government and the Belgian Parliament carry out their tasks at long last.
It is a disgrace which we must continue to denounce in public.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although money is not everything, the way money is handled shows if a policy is successful or not.
Those were the words of a former President of the Court of Auditors, Bernhard Friedmann, and if we take those words as a yardstick for this year's report, then we really have to ask just how successful the Union's policies are in practice.
The report before us summarises what we already know from many other reports: there is still a need for reform in financial management and the way funds are implemented.
There are dramatic shortcomings in many areas, which suggests that financial errors are endemic.
The Commission's tendency to blame irregularities and deficits the Court discovers chiefly on the Member States is unacceptable.
Of course the Member States cannot shake off their own responsibilities, if there are irregularities or fraud in the Member States, the Commission must act accordingly.
The recovery rate, that is the reimbursement of funds that have been lost, is not satisfactory.
It is not acceptable if Member States underperform in the fight against fraud because of lax controls and are then slow to get funds reimbursed as well.
Politically speaking, the Commission has final responsibility for the EU budget and it is accordingly also responsible for efficient implementation of funds and checks.
One of the things mentioned in the Commission's responses on last year's report is that new systems are being introduced which primarily aim to make it easier to check the efficiency of VAT collection in the individual Member States.
Given that significant shortcomings have also been identified in this area, we also have to ask how effective these control mechanisms are.
I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for its successful investigative work and I call on the Commission to take further structural reform actions so that mismanagement and financial errors become a thing of the past.
Mr President, what can I say in two minutes?
Well, first of all and very simply, I shall say goodbye and thank you to President Karlsson.
I shall say goodbye, now that you are leaving us, after giving many years of loyal service, and thank you for the excellent cooperation that you developed with this House and for the quality of this report, which now seems like an impressive aircraft carrier, surrounded by a squadron of special reports.
I shall make three brief comments, as I have very little time.
First of all, I believe that you are right to emphasise that the major problem with the 2000 budget is the massive under-implementation of a number of funds.
Admittedly, Mrs Schreyer is right to say that there are sometimes good reasons for this under-implementation, but generally the budgetary authority feels a sense of frustration and is aware that there are problems related to this under-implementation.
I shall give four examples. The first is the overly complex regulations, the difficulties in managing the project cycle, the poor interaction in execution and control between the Commission and the Member States, and, lastly, the often pernickety control which has the effect of taking away responsibility.
These are the areas we will be focusing on in the discharge.
I have one comment to make on the DAS.
I am pleased to see that the Court of Auditors is keeping a good distance and we must do the same thing with the error rate.
The overall error rate is merely the scientifically dubious aggregation of spot checks, which, whilst interesting, are random.
I do not want everything to hinge on the error rate, which will determine everything.
The Court of Auditors is reassessing this issue.
Parliament must monitor and support this.
My third and final comment relates to the management of surpluses.
In my view, it is a shame that surpluses are systematically reimbursed to Member States.
In fact, economically speaking, this management strategy has a pro-cyclical effect, which is absurd.
We support growth when it is strong, and then, since there is a lack of money, we penalise growth when it is weak.
We should consider other forms of multi-annual regulation from a statutory point of view.
Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to focus, in this debate, on the Court of Auditors' special report on export refunds.
This is yet another important contribution to our understanding of the vital need to promote a thorough reform of the CAP in areas such as the funding of exports of agricultural products.
Until today, I had never read, in one publication, such a devastating set of facts on the misuse of public funds by the European institutions, some of which are worth highlighting.
EUR 80 million from the Community budget were used to fund supplies to Iraq, in breach of the embargo imposed by the United Nations. Little or none of this money has to date been recovered.
According to statements made by the Russian customs authorities themselves in August 2000, almost 80% of Community subsidies for exports to that country, currently being examined by OLAF, have proved to be fraudulent. It should be remembered that Russia is the main destination for subsidised European exports.
The Community has set up free import agreements with candidate countries, but is still subsidising the export of dairy products to these countries.
As a result, we have the classic roundabout scenario already seen in Estonia, in which the Community subsidised butter exports, which were then imported free from customs duties.
The number of supposedly pure-bred cattle whose export the Community has already funded would be enough to give some importer countries, with Mediterranean or desert climates, huge reserves of pure-bred European cattle.
The system of control and monitoring bodies, designed to ensure the veracity of export statements has proved to be a complete fiasco.
The Commission assured us, even in the context of the last budgetary discharge and on the Fléchard procedure, that exports to Russia in particular, were now being properly monitored.
This report by the Court of Auditors categorically disproves the Commission' s words.
Mr President, this is the first time that we have received a report that pertains to a period for which the Prodi Commission is entirely responsible.
Can we draw clear conclusions from it?
No, not really.
That is why my group hopes that the discharge procedure will eventually give us the answer to the following questions: which countries cause most problems, which areas of policy are most problematic and what can be done about this, where does the Commission carry out its tasks and where does it fail to do so, but also where have improvements been made and where has that not been the case?
We can already detect some improvement.
That is partly thanks to the commitment by this European Parliament, but also the Court of Auditors, for which we are very grateful.
However, this is still not enough.
Moreover, it is still not possible to issue a general Statement of Assurance, and the budget surplus is currently at an all-time high.
Progress has thus been made in small ways, but that is not enough to really gain the confidence of the people in Europe.
In the final analysis, that is what we all need to work towards.
Mr President, when I read the Never-Ending Story to my grandchild, Niklas, I think of the Court of Auditors' annual report.
There are an incredible number of problems which crop up again and again, year after year.
Lamentable control systems in the Member States, lost income from VAT, bureaucratic and complicated export refund arrangements, farmers who overstate how much land they have, misappropriation of structural funds, fraud involving research funds in the form of over-payment, and long-winded and bureaucratic procedures concerning the EU' s external aid.
It is the same old story every single year.
However, it is now the Member States that are the biggest culprits. It cannot be said often enough.
The agricultural and structural funds are what cause us problems.
There is a very tough approach this year to the management of the structural funds.
I proposed last year in my discharge report that the Commission should impose fines upon those Member States which offend again and again, and I am extremely pleased that Mrs Schreyer and the Commission have promised to look constructively at this possibility.
Denmark is also mentioned a couple of times in the annual report, and that is a couple of times too many.
There are problems with farmers' overstating how much land they have, and pathetic control systems at quite a few custom houses.
The Danish practice of collecting users' fees for the issue of export refunds has also been found to be illegal.
It is thanks to the Court of Auditors that the Commission has finally realised what is unlawful about this practice.
I am also pleased that we are working on the problems caused through the pile of work involving guarantee payments in Denmark, which are a disaster.
In this area, too, the Commission has been a good and effective partner.
I would also say to Mr Karlsson that I should never in my life have believed that a Dane would end up missing a Swede.
That is, however, the case and, since I, myself, am also leaving Parliament after this parliamentary term, we must set up a club for former Scandinavian MEPs in which we can rhapsodise about the old days.
I think that the children' s book, 'Karlsson-on-the-Roof' was written with you in mind.
Thank you for your fruitful cooperation over seven years.
Mr President, I have a couple of observations to make.
First, we need to recognise that, once again, the Court of Auditors has been unable to give a positive statement of assurance in respect of Commission expenditure.
I want to resist our gradually starting to regard the abnormal as being the norm.
We can perhaps do that in this case, but certainly not outside this area.
If this statement of assurance is procedurally weak, then I expect the Court of Auditors to make a statement to that effect.
Otherwise we must note that there is a weakness in Commission expenditure that needs to be criticised politically speaking.
My second point is that I am very grateful to you, Commissioner, for having highlighted the link between today's debate on progress reports in connection with enlargement and the report of the Court of Auditors.
The Court of Auditors has told us that in respect of the new pre-accession instruments there was actually a zero expenditure policy in 2000.
That means that in practice - and the Commission is talking about the first candidate countries acceding in 2004 - we have already wasted 20% of the time available in the financial area.
And that means of course that we will have to work even harder in the coming years in order to implement the pre-accession instruments properly.
My third point is a comment about OLAF.
I was surprised, Mr Karlsson, that your report more or less suggested that by adding a reserve for setting up OLAF, Parliament had affected the independence of that body.
We felt obliged to do this when the Commission - as you know - simply transferred all UCLAF's staff to OLAF, and apparently thought the job was done. And all the more so when we discovered from the OLAF Monitoring Committee for which you have such high regard that OLAF's independence genuinely was at risk.
Now that we have been able to deal with the Commission, and I would specifically like to thank Mrs Schreyer for that, we have a new problem.
This is an area where I believe the Commission should step in, Mrs Schreyer.
The new Berlusconi government is now blocking one of the central posts in the new OLAF.
I would be grateful if we could all pull together on this one.
Mr President, the report of the Court of Auditors is always rather like the starting pistol for the discharge procedure, which we then hope to conclude in the April of the following year, although we do not always succeed.
Now that we have been working off the inherited liabilities for several years, something that has consistently attracted media attention, it now seems to me that we are tackling more systemic problems where it is not so much spectacular individual cases that are at stake, but rather whether systems are flawed in some way.
I would like to address once again three points that arose most often in the debate.
The first one is the high level of unimplemented appropriations.
In the course of the discharge procedure, we will have to ask ourselves whether this is attributable to the caution officials exercise before they will sign something off and spend money, or whether it is to do with overcomplicated rules.
For example, given the many complaints I hear from my constituents and others about all the red tape you have to cope with in dealing with Brussels if you want to get support for something, I fear that I know the answer already. Although I am willing to accept it if this is clearly refuted, this is still an issue we need to sort out.
The second point is the statement of assurance, which has just been mentioned, and Mr Bösch has pointed out the dilemma we face.
We need to ask ourselves if there are more reliable instruments or if we are treating this statement of assurance in the same way that the Council does year after year, that is as a kind of weather report that is not binding in any way.
My final point is this: we need to establish whether the Member States' handling of EU money has got worse or whether it is just being scrutinised more carefully now.
If the latter is the case, that would represent some progress and the Commission could be given some credit for that.
But it is the Commission's job to step up pressure on the Member States, and we will be glad to help out.
Before giving the floor back to Mr Karlsson I should like to say to him on behalf of Parliament that we appreciate the fruitful cooperation we have had over the years of his presidency.
We wish you all the very best for the future.
Mr Blak has probably paid you the ultimate compliment by talking about a Dane missing a Swede.
That is like a Scot saying we want England to win at football.
That was a real compliment.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Mr President, on behalf of my outgoing colleagues and myself I would like to assure you that I have never regretted my resignation as much as at this moment.
I wish I could resign every time we met in order to listen to this lovely music.
So thank you very much for all the nice words.
Not least, when I go home to Sweden I shall tell them of these kind words from Denmark.
Thank you, Mr. Blak.
I realise there is a heavy agenda, but I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words.
I shall start with what Mr Kuhne has just said.
It seems that a number of issues have been put behind us and there is a feeling - which I also had yesterday in a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control - that we are now able to address some major issues for the future.
The first is one which underlies the budget surplus problem.
It is not so much the revenue I am thinking of, as the under-utilisation and the under-implementation of funds, which, in turn, has a lot to do with our problems in achieving good management and fighting fraud - namely the over-complexity of Union funds and administration and regulations.
I have had a long discussion on that with the discharge rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, and I feel confident that this problem will be addressed now.
My personal advice to Parliament is to do everything in its power, together with other institutions, to simplify things.
On all the major issues, such as the pre-accession funds, structural funds and export refunds and on the market regulations in agriculture, we have built a mountain of complexity which, if I may for once step into the realm of political judgment, raises the major question of the European citizens' confidence in this Union.
I would say that if I had to choose one of the tasks that Mr Kuhne mentioned as being the most important, it would be: simplify, for heaven's sake!
I wish you every success in that.
I think that this Parliament, together with the Court of Auditors and the other institutions, will in the future manage to increase confidence among European citizens in our great project, which, of course, is the primary goal for all of our institutions.
With that, I thank you once again, on behalf of myself and my colleagues, for your kind words and for this most stimulating and interesting exchange of views.
That concludes this item.
Money laundering
The next item is the report (A5-380/2001) by Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 91/308/EEC of 10 June 1991 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering (PE-CONS 3654/2001 - C5-0496/2001 - 1999/0152(COD)).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this second directive on money laundering in Europe has a long history.
You know that legislation on money laundering in the Member States of the European Union has its roots not so much in the will of the national legislatures but rather in the fact that back in 1991 the European Union brought in the first money-laundering directive, which acted as a catalyst for a string of national money-laundering laws being adopted.
However, the 1991 directive only set a minimum standard.
This minimum standard provided that drug-related offences should be included in the list of predicate offences, and with regard to professions that were obliged to take part in the fight against money laundering, only banks and providers of financial services were covered by compulsory provisions.
This led to major differences in transposal in Europe.
There were Member States that went well beyond this minimum standard, and other Member States that only implemented the minimum standard.
Back in 1995, the European Parliament's then Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs organised a major hearing on this.
The outcome of that hearing was that the differences in transposal were leading to major problems in combating money laundering in Europe, as cooperation between the Member States was not functioning adequately either.
For us in this House, the result - and there were two reports on this, one in 1996 and the other in 1998 - was that we called on the Commission to bring forward a second directive in order to raise standards in Europe, and in particular to extend the list of predicate offences and the list of professions covered.
At that time we suggested that the professions covered should include dealers in luxury items, casinos, auctioneers and also solicitors, notaries and other providers of legal advice.
The Commission then brought forward its proposal in 1999, but we considered that at least as far as providers of legal advice were concerned, it was not sufficiently sensitive.
As you know, since the Charter of Nice at least, citizens have the right to legal advice and representation, and this is also rooted in various national constitutions.
This can only be effectively guaranteed if those citizens are also in a position to give their legal adviser any information safe in the knowledge that this will be kept confidential and that their legal adviser will not phone the public prosecutor the next day and pass on this information.
That is why Parliament was concerned to preserve this right at first reading, while at the same time effectively combating money laundering in Europe.
This then went into the conciliation procedure, and I believe that the compromise which emerged was a good one.
The Council gave ground on the Member States being allowed, in accordance with their own legal traditions, to let legal advice continue to be covered by the obligation of professional secrecy.
On the other hand, Parliament also gave some ground, by not demanding that this arrangement should be made compulsory, but that it should instead be at the discretion of national legislatures.
Article 6(3) therefore gives all Member States the option, depending on their own national legal traditions, of providing for the obligation of professional secrecy to be observed in the area of legal advice.
Exactly the same procedure was followed for other contentious points, and some excellent compromises were reached on those too.
The subject of tipping off, in other words a ban on information given to one's legal adviser being passed on to others, has also been solved by means of a compromise under Article 6(3), that is to say by means of a discretionary arrangement.
The issue of what should be done with information received in this way and which is in the hands of the public prosecutor's office has been left at the discretion of national legislatures.
To put it simply, all the parties involved finally said that they were not 100% satisfied with this compromise, nor was it ideal, but they could live with it.
That is exactly what a good compromise is about, and I would therefore like to recommend to this House that it should accept the proposal that has emerged from the Conciliation Committee, thus making a substantial contribution to strengthening the fight against money laundering in Europe.
Against the background of the present situation, and the need to combat terrorism, this is an important factor.
On the other hand, we have accordingly also managed to ensure that our citizens' fundamental rights have been preserved without any need to interfere with mature national legal traditions which in some cases are of a constitutional nature.
All in all, a good compromise then, please vote for it.
Mr President, I represent a minority.
The new Recital 16 says that there is an obligation to report suspicions "if the legal counsellor is taking part in money laundering activities, the legal advice is provided for money laundering purposes, or the lawyer knows that the client is seeking legal advice for money laundering purposes".
That is going too far.
That is why I am voting against this.
It would destroy the integrity of advice.
It also has a second implication which has not up to now been the case under our existing legislation: in all three cases the legal counsellor or lawyer would be committing a criminal offence.
He would therefore also have to denounce himself.
That is totally unheard of anywhere in the world.
I am fairly sure that even in the Stone Age there was no law saying that.
For some inexplicable reason, the Commission has felt moved for the first time ever in law to adopt a legal provision whereby one must denounce oneself.
I certainly cannot vote for that.
Lessing comes to mind, who said that if enlightenment is only a small light glimmering in the darkness, there is at least still some hope in the world.
You have made the same mistake as with the OLAF legislation, which in the end has even penetrated into Members' offices.
You will be stopped there.
This could not stand up to constitutional scrutiny.
When we were debating the OLAF legislation, I said that the European Union as a whole had had a rush of regulatory blood to the head.
We seem to have a similar phenomenon again here.
I also regard it as a matter for great regret that the legal profession has shown so little backbone on this issue.
Mr President, one of the biggest gaps in the anti-money laundering regime has been that it only applied to financial institutions.
As successive international reports have made clear, lawyers and other professionals become vulnerable to exploitation as unwitting accomplices in the washing of dirty money from criminals and terrorists as banks tighten up, which, I am glad to say, they are at last having to do.
I regard the outcome of the conciliation on this directive as satisfactory if it is interpreted in a common sense way.
That means that lawyers, accountants and tax advisers must, outside a strict definition of legal privilege, report transactions that are suspicious, in other words, that they have reason to believe their client is involved in money laundering.
This is the only feasible interpretation.
There has been a huge amount of hype on this directive aimed at protecting lawyers' vested interests and not, I am afraid to say, individual rights.
This has delayed the finalisation of the directive for an unnecessary six months.
Parliament has not exactly covered itself with glory.
I hope all Member States will declare that they have no intention of invoking the option to exempt lawyers from the ban on tipping off clients that the authorities have been alerted.
We need to make sure that our legal and financial systems are not exploited, rather than concentrating on the position of the lawyers themselves and their own self-interest.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on succeeding in achieving a sensible joint proposal on the more important points of this report in codecision.
However, the Radical Members of the Bonino List will not be able to vote for this report because it has two shortcomings: the first concerns the joint text itself which gives the Member States' the right to use information obtained through proceedings combating money laundering for other types of investigations as well.
This point introduces the danger that, in actual fact, the investigating authorities might use investigations into money laundering to obtain special powers as a way to get round the rules, so to speak, a way to get round the normal protection rights governing information obtained during proceedings on other issues.
The second point on which we have reservations is more general: it is the recommendation that the fight against money laundering should be seen as the priority.
In our opinion, if we are to win the battle, if we are to strike at the profits of criminal organisations, our most urgent priority should be to legalise drugs.
This text was adopted on the wave of events following the attacks of 11 September.
We must not forget that Afghanistan, which we are currently attacking with military force, is responsible for 80% of the world' s opium production.
Well then, maybe a policy of legalising drugs would be a more effective way of reducing the power of the drug barons than pursuing their capital throughout the world.
Mr President, the thorny problem in the text before us is, of course, the balance between the legally recognised obligation of professional secrecy, on the one hand, and, on the other, the duty to pass information which assists the fight against money laundering to the appropriate authorities.
The money-laundering directive imposes a string of obligations on credit and financial institutions, with the result that money launderers have simply switched to other sectors, hence the need to extend the scope of the directive to other professions.
Whilst we of course welcome more stringent measures, they should not lead to a watering down of the obligation of professional secrecy for various professions, and above all for lawyers, notaries and tax consultants.
Mr Rothley is right in saying that the text before us is chipping away at the principle of nemo tenetur se ipsum accusare, no one is bound to incriminate himself.
However, that is the very compromise that we think is workable, and we believe that the need to balance professional secrecy on the one hand and the need to bring criminals to book on the other has been solved in an acceptable way, and we shall therefore be voting in favour of this.
Mr President, I wish to congratulate and thank the rapporteur.
Because of your commitment, we have been able to see off the attack the Council and Commission were making on the fundamental rights and rights to defence of Europe's citizens.
It is not acceptable for defence counsel, solicitors, tax consultants and notaries simply to be turned into part of the public prosecution service.
It is also evident that the battle to maintain rights to defence is not over yet.
The directive still has to be transposed into national legislation, and we must continue to argue that it should not be subject to an excessively narrow interpretation at national level, thus restricting citizens' fundamental rights and rights to defence.
However, I can also assure you that I will be making representations to the appropriate Austrian authorities to make sure that precisely this does not happen.
Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, I welcome very much the agreement which has been reached by Parliament and the Council.
Delegations in the conciliation procedure on the proposal for a second money laundering directive have given their support to this compromise proposal, and the Commission is duly appreciative.
I should like in particular to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, and also vice-president Provan for co-chairing the conciliation meeting, for their determined efforts to reach an agreement which, as I have said, is very much welcomed by the Commission.
The Commission proposal to update and extend the 1991 anti-money-laundering directive - which Parliament called for as early as 1995, as was mentioned quite rightly this morning - has raised difficult and sensitive issues of which the Commission is fully aware.
Not least, the involvement of the professions in the anti-money-laundering defences has attracted the attention of many people interested in this subject and, in particular, Members of this Parliament.
The Commission believes that the joint text agreed in the conciliation procedure constitutes a good compromise, taking account of the legitimate concerns of both Parliament and the Council.
The fight against money laundering is an essential aspect of the fight against serious and organised crime.
Since the tragic events of 11 September, it has also become an integral part of the fight against the financing of terrorism.
The proposal before us now, to strengthen the European Union's anti-money-laundering defences, has aroused great interest in the world outside the European Union, not least in the so-called financial action task force which is in the process of updating its 40 recommendations.
So to sum up, I commend the joint text to Parliament and I look forward to the earliest possible adoption and implementation of this important new directive.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Approximation of civil and commercial law
The next item is the report (A5-384/2001) by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the approximation of the civil and commercial law of the Member States [COM(2001) 398 - C5-0471/2001 - 2001/2187(COS)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this too is a very important report.
What is it about?
It is about the fact that although the internal market in Europe is becoming ever more integrated, there are also various deficits, as we all know.
The Commission, the Parliament and the Council have been trying for many years to achieve joint legislation, particularly in the field of consumer protection.
In the communication on contract law which the Commission has brought forward, and which is also referred to in this report, the Commission covered in detail the position on the common body of law which already exists in the European Union, and also referred to all the directives already in existence in this field.
However, if you take a closer look at these directives, you will see that they are not always necessarily consistent.
It is quite conceivable for there to be a contract entered into between a purchaser and a vendor in which the purchaser may have to sign three different cancellation statements with different cancellation deadlines, because totally different deadlines are found in different directives, such as the distance-selling directive and other directives.
It is pretty obvious that this does little for consumer protection and is sheer nonsense.
That is why it is necessary for this common body of law to be consolidated and summarised to achieve a common result.
There are many reasons why this situation has come about.
It can be explained, in part, simply by the fact that within the European institutions totally different directorates-general, committees and Councils were responsible for individual aspects, and of course they always looked at things from their own isolated point of view, which then led to quite different end results.
So up to now there has not been an integrated approach, an integrated view of the approximation of civil rights.
I think it is a very good thing that following the decisions taken at the Tampere Council, the Commission now intends, just like this House, to adopt an integrated approach in future.
This is a matter of urgent necessity, as the volume of cross-border trade is on the increase in Europe.
There are two key factors which explain this. The first is, of course, the introduction of the euro next year.
A second factor is the impact of modern technology, and I only have to mention electronic commerce.
If, in the future, you order goods or other commodities via electronic commerce, you will have no idea, or, at least, you frequently will not have, of where the company you are dealing with is based.
This is leading to an inevitable growth in cross-border trade.
That is why I believe that it is also necessary for us to develop more common definitions of offences and a broader common body of Community law.
The present electronic commerce directive, which we in this House supported, is not therefore, as we already know, an ideal solution.
As the country of origin principle applies here, whereas in the case of consumer rights law the country of destination principle applies, this can lead in practice to situations such as a district court judge in Cologne having to apply Irish law in parallel with German law.
I would not mind betting that this will lead to considerable problems when only trifling amounts are at stake and with bread-and-butter legal cases.
This demonstrates that we need to develop a broader common body of law in future.
My report now envisages, with the support of many expert groups who have been calling for this for a long time, that the Commission should continue its work by means of an action plan covering several years.
At the end of that process, and this is my belief at least, the result should be a common body of law within the European Union, for cross-border transactions at least, which is as extensive as possible.
With regard to transparency, I believe that this is necessary, not only for consumers, but also for businesspeople, and this also applies to legal certainty, legal practicality and the application of the law.
I therefore wish to ask the House to give its approval to the proposal emanating from the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on this report regarding the approximation of the civil and commercial law of the Member States.
This is, as it were, the starting pistol for the Commission's work.
I know that the Council is currently considering this matter in parallel with ourselves, and that it is intended to deal with this subject at the Laeken Summit.
I believe that everyone in Europe has recognised that this issue is of a very high priority, and that progress needs to be made with this work.
In order to exert a little bit of pressure, I think that we should approve this action plan.
Mr President, this is a rather peculiar cooperation procedure between Parliament and the Commission, at an initial phase of the Commission' s work.
The communication presented to us by the Commission referred to a limited aspect of the harmonisation of private law, specifically contract law, and the report presented by Mr Lehne deals which a much wider scope, because it refers to the harmonisation of private law in general.
We, in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, considered that contract law was probably too narrow a scope and that it would not be sufficient to produce harmonisation of private law in general, which is necessary, as Mr Lehne pointed out, above all within the framework of the introduction of the euro and of the generalisation of European contracts.
The Commission' s communication is very broad, given the aspects it deals with and the questions it poses.
We, in Parliament, clearly cannot work intensely and on time, as we would have liked, but we can make some observations.
I will focus on one: the possibility that, in relation to harmonisation, more reference should be made to the regulation and less to the directive.
Because we are seeing that every time a Community directive is adopted, it gives rise to fifteen different national legislations, which leads us to think that we are possibly not achieving the objective of harmonisation, but quite the opposite, because the Community directive paradoxically leads to discrepancies in the development of each national legislation.
I know that this is a difficult issue, because there is still legislative zeal of a national nature, but it is one of the possibilities for development by means of Community legislation, instead of merely indirect harmonisation via a directive.
I must stop here through lack of time, but not without congratulating the Commission on its initiative and the rapporteur on his report.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur on taking this important issue forward and also to congratulate the Commission on a very good consultation document on contract law.
We have made a good start in what is a very politically sensitive area.
Although we might see the practical arguments for moving forward because of the advent of the euro and because of e-commerce, we have to ensure that our citizens are also comfortable with this.
Every time we talk about approximation of core civil law subjects, I see scare stories in the English press that English common law is about to be replaced by the Code Napoléon, complete with a small picture of Napoleon.
Last week English contract law was supposed to be under threat.
However misguided some of this comment might be, we have to respect the concerns and deal with them.
The process outlined in this report will allow us to do so.
The Commission has made some very pragmatic suggestions about contract law, which I hope the Council will act on.
It was, after all, the Council that brought forward this idea of convergence in the Tampere agenda.
We must insist that the area of freedom and justice referred to there is as much about civil law as about criminal law.
The Tampere conclusions foresaw convergence in civil law.
Convergence is a long process, not an abrupt event.
It is not about imposing a European civil code. It is about channelling and guiding developments in Community law to give us a more coherent and less piecemeal approach, ultimately allowing more knowledge of the law and greater access to justice across Europe's internal market.
In considering these matters, we would do much better to concentrate on what draws us together in Europe's common legal heritage.
All our legal traditions owe something to the early modern fusion of feudal, Roman and canon law called ius commune.
We now have the chance to guide and structure the modern reconvergence of our legal systems.
We should welcome that opportunity.
Mr President, there was a time when Europeans travelled all over the universities of Europe and studied what was still a common law based on the Roman law.
Indeed, in my own country, Scotland, that lasted until the 17th century, during which 6000 members of the Faculty of Advocates of Scotland at various times studied in the universities of Utrecht and Leiden.
That kind of interaction of lawyers is one of the things which contributed most to our civilisation and from which our legal civilisation has grown.
So this is a very good project and the time-tabling suggested by Mr Lehne and the Commission is feasible and worthwhile.
Nevertheless, as Mrs Wallis has said, legal traditions are valued objects.
People concern themselves greatly about the coherence and integrity of a legal order.
Therefore it must be with great sensitivity that we move forward in bringing back together again legal systems and legal traditions through the kinds of common definition that Mr Lehne is suggesting.
With that in mind, I have one doubt and it involves a difference with what Mr Medina Ortega has just said.
Clause 14 of the report suggests that a regulation is really the best way to take this forward.
The difficulty relates to subsidiarity.
If these things are to be done well, common definitions will have to be sensitively adapted and grafted into what are very deep and organic legal traditions.
You cannot do that by thrusting a regulation down the throats of the legal community.
We in the United Kingdom have two legal systems, rather distinct, and it is going to be absolutely vital for this development that both are adequately and properly represented in further discussions, as they have been on bodies like the Lando Commission in the past.
Mr President, I would first like to strike a critical note, because although the rapporteur explained the need for haste to the committee and I also understand that, I believe that there should not be fast-track procedures of this kind, because they can lead to botch-ups.
However, I would like to specifically exclude the rapporteur's report from that comment.
I am totally in agreement with the content of the report, because approximation of Community law as it applies to SMEs is also absolutely necessary if we are to increase legal certainty for cross-border contracts, especially in view of the forthcoming enlargement of the Union.
It would be irresponsible to create free trade areas without making provision for the necessary instruments to keep commercial trade on track.
However, it is my belief, and this is something that Mr MacCormick just touched upon, that the mature traditions underpinning the legal systems of the Member States impose certain limitations on the approximation of civil and commercial law, and that a failure to respect those traditions would inevitably lead to the opposite of what we are trying to achieve.
However, I believe that these problems have been adequately addressed and that it is also possible to achieve this objective, which we will therefore be supporting.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lehne, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to know how many legal transactions have taken place in the European Union during the last 15 minutes, while we have been debating.
Would it be a million, 10 million or even 100 million?
Whatever, I believe that it must be a large figure.
We are in a world of what in German we call "Massengeschäfte" a term that is not perhaps particularly easy to translate into other languages - bread-and-butter transactions, perhaps.
I am sure that only a fraction of these legal transactions will have been cross-border, and I am equally sure that these transactions, ranging from Lapland to Sicily, from Scotland to Bavaria, will have been conducted according to totally different traditions and customs.
That is why we need to be clear that this is a very sensitive area and however ambitious we may be, we still need to proceed very carefully and prudently.
Mrs Wallis has already referred to the reaction in the United Kingdom, for example.
So I think it is reasonable for the Commission to propose in its Option II that we should initially work out some general legal principles.
One expert very appositely said that the problem with legal convergence is not so much the rules as the exceptions.
We have discovered precisely that through our own work, in the case of warranty periods on purchases, interest on arrears, money laundering and also the takeover directive.
General principles can be agreed quickly, but in contrast it is very difficult to harmonise which groups should be given special treatment and who qualifies for special protection.
That is why we also need to set reasonable priorities for our work.
The cross-border aspects should be prioritised in the first place.
We need to achieve compatibility between European legislation and national legislation, but national legislative provisions also need to be made compatible with each other.
Courts need to cooperate more effectively and mutual legal assistance needs to be guaranteed.
I believe that these are concrete, practical steps that we can implement from one day to the next, which would assist legal transactions between our citizens within the single market.
I think that in considering these matters, we should also deal with the concept of working towards a European law as an option for parties entering into contracts.
They could therefore choose either to opt for a legal system created in Europe or else continue to use national law.
As I see it, this would be a kind of soft harmonisation, setting in train a process of convergence which, Mr MacCormick, would be better than regulations adopted as an abrupt event, as Mrs Wallis put it.
Against this background I would also like to say that Mr Lehne's draft does not, of course, reiterate the demands that we made in 1989 and 1994.
At that time we demanded that a European Civil Code should be drawn up, but as far as I can see, that proposal has not been incorporated in the texts adopted in committee nor in the amendments.
We have adopted a good, reasonable and cautious approach here.
I would like to thank both the rapporteur and all those who helped with the hearing for their assistance.
Mr President, by and large I agree with the rapporteur, and in the limited time I have available I can only mention one or two rather unrelated points.
What we need to start with at EU level is coherent and homogeneous legislation.
That is very often not the case, because terms are used which have a different meaning in other legal texts.
Scarcely any academic research has been done into this aspect of Community law.
So the first thing we should do is to ensure coherence and homogeneity in our own legal texts, and I would urge you to set up an expert committee to do this.
That is one point.
The other point that I would like to address is how this relates to international civil law.
It seems to me that Mr Lehne has rather neglected this aspect in his report.
International civil law can make an important contribution to overcoming the difficulties involved in cross-border legal disputes, and as a rule, and I am choosing my words very carefully now, international civil law is certainly not inferior to Community law, certainly as far as legal culture and the quality of legal texts are concerned.
So if, as in the case of the directive on electronic commerce, you take issue with international civil law, the situation becomes very difficult indeed.
We therefore need to examine once more to what extent we can retain international civil law.
My final point concerns national regulations.
I think this is an area where we should not overreach ourselves.
That will be very difficult.
I believe that it would be best for us to have convincing law making in the European Union.
Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to congratulate Parliament and especially the Committee on Legal Affairs and its rapporteur, Mr Lehne, on its timely report on the approximation of the civil and commercial laws of the Member States.
Given the forthcoming European Council in December in Laeken, for which this report will be of relevance, I am particularly pleased that the European Parliament is discussing this report here today.
The European Council will therefore have at its disposal not only the Commission's communication and the Council's report, but also the report by the European Parliament, which handles this important issue in the necessary depth.
The Commission also very much welcomes the report as Parliament's response to the Commission's consultation process, launched by the communication on European contract law.
It is absolutely essential that the Commission should get as much feedback and input as possible from the other EC institutions so that it can establish its future approach in the area of contract law.
One fundamental question confronts the Commission, as well as Parliament and the Council as the two branches of the European legislature.
Should we continue with the existing piecemeal approach of harmonising European contract law in a very sector-specific way, as has been done for the past 20 years, or should we adopt a new approach?
It is obvious that if the existing approach corresponds to the needs of the European Union then we should continue it.
If, however, there are problems despite, or possibly even because of, the existing approach, then we should be brave enough to change it.
It was in order to get a reply to this fundamental question that the Commission adopted its communication on European contract law.
The choice of our future approach is highly important for the smooth functioning of the internal market and the participation of consumers, small- and medium-sized enterprises and all other economic operators, as well as for the uniform application of Community law.
We have already received a large number of constructive comments and reactions which confirm that the Commission's initiative is of great interest to all stakeholders.
Of course not all the reactions point in the same direction, but this is inevitable with such a complex subject where so many issues are raised and different options need to be considered.
The reactions will be examined in depth by the Commission.
Obviously the Commission will attach great importance to Parliament's response to our communication which, once you have adopted it, will be very carefully analysed.
The Commission will decide what suggestions it will make in the light of the reports from Parliament and the Council, the possible reaction from the European Council and the responses to our consultation process.
I understand that the Council may ask the Commission to report to the Community institutions and the public on the consultation process, together with any observations and recommendations if necessary in the form of a Green or White Paper, not later than 31 December 2002.
The European Parliament's proposal for an action plan is particularly relevant in this context.
The Commission has taken due note of the ambitious deadlines for specific steps to be taken.
In conclusion, I would like to express the Commission's thanks for the careful analysis that has gone into this report.
If there are problems for the internal market and the uniform application of Community law which need to be tackled, it is obvious that whatever line we take this will be a longer term project of considerable importance.
So, this is certainly not the last time that we will debate questions of European contract law in this House.
I submitted the Commission communication to the college, together with my colleagues Mr Vitorino, Mr Bolkestein and Mr Liikanen.
At the last Council meeting on the internal market and consumer affairs, I emphasised my strong personal interest in this matter, not only because I am convinced of its value but also because of my own professional background as a practising barrister and as international commercial arbitrator.
For those who have expressed concern about the survival of the common law system: that is the system that I have worked in myself for 27 years and I have some attachment to it.
Perhaps with that background it will be able to make sure that these issues and sensitivities are taken fully into account.
This is an ambitious project but it is a feasible project.
When I worked on contracts where arbitration was needed or on dispute had to be resolved, the "applicable law" was - lex mercatoria.
What is that?
Those who have to enter into contracts with a term like that will feel perfectly comfortable with something a bit more rigid and rigorous, which is what all of us in this House are aiming at.
My colleagues and I are therefore looking forward to constructive dialogue with Parliament and the other EC institutions in the future.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Arbitrary arrests and the political situation in Laos
The next item is the Commission statement on arbitrary arrests and the political situation in Laos.
Mr President, I am honoured to make this declaration on behalf of the Commission on the arrests in Laos PDR.
The Commission welcomes the release of the five members of the Transnational Radical Party who had been arrested on 26 October in Vientiane, Laos PDR, after staging a peaceful demonstration.
We are particularly happy to see Mr Dupuis back.
Their release followed 14 days of detention, during which the Commission and EU Member States made frequent contacts with the Laotian authorities to ensure a rapid resolution of the situation.
At a public trial on 9 November, the detainees were found guilty of violating Laotian law.
They were given suspended sentences before being released and expelled from the country.
In relation to this incident, the Commission notes that the human rights situation in Laos PDR, including the case of the Laotian students who organised a demonstration for freedom and democracy in Laos PDR in October 1999, continues to give cause for concern.
The Commission, together with the diplomatic missions of the EU Member States, is following the human rights situation in the country closely and participating in all EU démarches to the government of Laos PDR on these issues.
Included in these issues are deficiencies in the rule of law.
There are still a number of flaws in the administration of justice, notably cases of arbitrary arrest, lengthy pre-trial detention and lack of guarantees of due process.
Many of these problems are exacerbated by the poor training of people working in the judicial system and the Commission has therefore offered assistance to the government of Laos PDR, both in reforming the system and in developing its human resources.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the arbitrary arrest of a Member of the European Parliament and a number of his fellow campaigners in Vientiane has put a severe strain on relations between the European Union and Laos.
In the intervening period both the institutions of the European Union and also the Member States concerned have done everything in their power to secure the release of those arrested.
In this context I would like to thank both the Commission and also the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, under the leadership of Elmar Brok, and also all those colleagues who have become involved in this issue.
Those arrested have now been released again.
The Italian government was particularly helpful in that it sent a government representative to Vientiane.
This action was ultimately successful.
I would also specifically like to thank the Ambassador of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, who made himself available for discussions with us both here and in Brussels and who obviously also had a very positive influence on events.
Laos has been a single-party state since 1975, that is to say that it is not a democracy as we understand it.
Places where there is no democracy and no freedom of choice usually do not have any constitutional checks either, and Laos is no exception to this.
Despite this, the European Union has a cooperation agreement with Laos, and in this framework the European Union is assisting not only the development of that country but is also helping to encourage democracy and constitutionality.
The ASEAN delegation accepted only this year that this assistance was indeed useful.
There are some very good projects in which the European Union is involved.
I would like to make it clear at this point that regardless of the unacceptable behaviour of the powers that be in Laos, we stand by our cooperation agreement and our willingness to provide assistance.
I also concede that our concept of democracy and constitutionality does not necessarily have to be accepted by every country on this planet.
In fact we need to ask ourselves every now and again if the European Parliament is really in a position to wave its finger at every country in the world and lecture them about democracy and constitutionality.
Nevertheless, we do have our principles and they have been infringed in this case.
We also intend to make sure that they are respected in future.
But we are willing to carry on helping Laos, whose people are amongst the poorest in the world, and to contribute to ensuring that this country has a chance of achieving a degree of prosperity.
However, we also want democracy and constitutionality to occupy their rightful place in Laos.
Mr President, we are now feeling relieved as our fellow Member, Olivier Dupuis, is fortunately back with us.
We should, however, revisit the problems that we were discussing last week so that we are somewhat less hesitant, should we have the misfortune to be in this situation again in the future.
First of all, we were facing some serious human rights issues.
Can a country detain individuals, without any form of trial, particularly foreign nationals who publicly campaign for democracy and human rights and condemn the breaches committed by the host country?
Even if Laotian law permitted this type of ban on demonstrations, it goes without saying that the immediate arrest of peaceful demonstrators was completely disproportionate.
Furthermore, it is natural for the European Union to be vigilant about whether or not a country like Laos observes the clause on human rights enshrined in the cooperation agreement that it signed.
Secondly, we were facing an institutional challenge that directly concerned the European Parliament, since one of the detainees was an MEP.
Of course, Mr Dupuis never asked for preferential treatment.
The European Parliament cannot, however, remain indifferent to how one of its members is treated.
The credibility and the honour of our institution, and even that of the European Union as a whole, depend on this.
This must be clear to everyone so that if we ever have the misfortune to be in this situation again, everyone has a role: the Commission, the Council, the High Representative, the Member States, Parliament, particularly the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy will react quickly and know exactly what to do and how to do it.
In fact, everyone did take the appropriate action, and we should welcome this.
We now need to do everything we can in order to encourage Laos to move forward, which is the purpose of the resolution that we shall be voting on this week.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to welcome the Prince Regent and the members of the Laotian royal family, the leaders and those in charge of the Laotian human rights organisations, my friends, Massimo Lensi and Bruno Mellano, who were my companions-in-arms during the demonstration and over the following days in Laos.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank you and President Fontaine, and all of you who supported the purpose of our action, which was and still is to free the five student leaders who were arrested in 1999 and about whom we still have no news today.
I think that the issue that we raised is, of course, much wider, it concerns democracy, and the globalisation of democracy.
At the beginning of the 1990s, Laos launched a process to bring about democratic change that, during the first five years, took the form of a number of openings in the economic sector.
Since 1995, however, we have witnessed an extremely serious drift, a transformation of the Communist regime into an utterly 'clepto-Communist' regime, or rather into a hybrid of clepto-Communism and narco-Communism.
This is extremely serious.
The people of Laos face this every day, and they are dying in their thousands at the hands of this regime.
Tens of thousands of Laotians, starting with the royal family of Laos, have quite simply been murdered in dribs and drabs.
The European Union, and also the Member States, must therefore understand the tragic nature of the situation in Laos.
We should first of all understand that the Stalinists and the drug traffickers who are running this country are preventing the democrats, both inside and outside Laos, and also those in favour of reform within the regime, from promoting reforms.
Instead of continuing to support politically correct projects, such as the promotion of women, the promotion of rural development, the protection of the environment, which, albeit worthwhile, do not tackle the root of the problem, the European Union should specifically attack the root of the problem which is democratic change, penal code reform, constitutional reform and guarantees of fundamental rights.
And I do not believe that the Commission and the Member States are doing what they should be doing in this area.
We must therefore change our policy, re-focus on law and on the promotion of law, and this is what we are attempting to do with the text of this resolution.
Mr President, I welcome the release of Mr Dupuis and our other four Radical friends from prison, but, at the same time, I am extremely concerned for the other five political detainees who are still being detained under arbitrary arrest.
We are concerned for their fate but what concerns us most is the fact that there has been no news of them at all for two years.
I am appalled by the unnecessary delay with which this institution reacted to the violence suffered by Mr Dupuis and the other Radical activists.
Lastly, Mr President, I would like to express my concern at a complex case of hypocrisy which Parliament and the European institutions have failed to address: on the one hand, they regularly, emotionally, bring up the issue of human rights, for the protection of human rights is a symbol of our political prowess and pride, yet, on the other, they are reluctant to apply the clause providing for the suspension of economic and commercial relations with those countries which systematically violate these rights, and not just in the case of Laos.
We should not be asking Parliament to teach the world democracy: rather, we should be demanding the greatest possible consistency from our institutions.
Thank you very much, Mr Fava.
I have received a motion for resolution pursuant to Rule 37 (2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Services of general interest in Europe
The next item is the report (A5-0361/2001) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication 'Services of General Interest in Europe' [COM(2000) 580 - C5-0399/2001 - 2001/2157(COS)].
Mr President, general interest services are services of both an economic and non-economic nature which are geared towards the public interest and in whose provision both the public at large and the state have a special interest.
In the various Member States of the European Union, this includes supplying the public with services in the fields of energy, water, waste disposal, transport, telecommunications, post, media, finance and insurance, a basic social, educational and training system, social services, external and internal security, a judiciary and a system of registration.
You will see from this broad span of services how wide-ranging this subject is.
Why are we concerned with this area?
Because some Member States, and, in particular, Germany, have questioned the power of the Commission to take decisions under Article 86 of the EC Treaty, and have also challenged the enactment of secondary Community law such as the transparency directive.
I believe that there is no justification for the fears of the Länder and municipalities that competition law will greatly undermine their powers and destroy the existing network of mature, tried and tested general interest structures.
Today we wish Parliament to adopt an opinion on the decisions to be taken by the Heads of State and Government in Laeken, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues very sincerely for their cooperation on this issue.
We have been trying for over a year, by means of hearings and a great many debates, to identify a common line.
The Commission's behaviour on this issue has been objective and I think I can say successful.
I would therefore like to thank the Commission, which I see is still represented here.
The Commission has comprehensively described the Community law framework.
It has presented the principles of neutrality, freedom of definition and proportionality, which we support, and in response to the question of how more legal certainty is to be achieved, it has proposed the use of exempting regulations and case-by-case decisions.
This is one of the questions that have to be resolved.
Whereas a good many Members favour an amendment to Article 16, we have agreed to propose a framework directive on the basis of Article 95, the internal market article, which will allow all unresolved issues to be settled, and using the codecision procedure, this is not to be a Council regulation or a Commission instrument, but a directive under the codecision procedure, so that we will be able to fully participate in decision making on these marginal issues under competition law.
There were two pivotal points in the debate: to what extent can we maintain structures that have developed along traditional lines or need to be opened up with regard to free markets and competition?
Secondly, to what extent is it permissible for the state to subsidise general interest services?
And if so, is there a difference between public and private companies?
What general interest services come under EU law?
Activities not included are all those of a non-economic nature and those that are purely national.
What does this cover?
EU competition law assumes that companies are involved and in this case we have the controls on state aid under Articles 87 to 89.
The internal market rules refer to economic activities, and in particular the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services.
In addition, there are activities relating to sovereignty which the state has effectively reserved to itself, and there are institutions which do not fall into this category, which are neither companies nor state institutions, the "independent charitable associations" or not-for-profit organisations which the Commission refers to in its observations on Article 30, as do we.
The EU's competition rules and the internal market rules are not applicable to purely internal national matters.
This is particularly relevant to general interest services at regional and local level.
If they are applicable, then there are exemption arrangements, such as the de minimis rule, such as aids for culture and such as the exempting regulations for small and medium-sized enterprises and other bodies.
For this reason, the Commission has given us a head start by means of this framework, and one with which we basically agree, in cases where we want to establish legal certainty on issues that we have openly debated and in cases where we want to declare the free market, competition in the market, to be a fundamental principle.
I would like to ask honourable Members to actively support the compromise that we worked out in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to heartily congratulate Mr Langen and will limit myself to just one aspect of a special public provision situation, that is, the cultural dimension in the audio-visual field, in other words public television and radio.
I was in favour of the introduction of private-sector television from the very outset, as I still am, whilst being convinced, in the final analysis, that we must work on the assumption that a public-service broadcasting remit is necessary.
Two particular aspects must be highlighted here: on the one hand the obligation to provide a service to all, that is, overall popular provision under appropriate conditions, and on the other the obligation to reflect the pluralistic nature of our society.
The dual broadcasting system has proved itself.
There would be no sense in constantly requiring the public broadcasters to justify every single programme.
A balanced programme needs leeway.
What is also certain is that we cannot allow taxes and licence fees to finance the creation of a public-service copy of the private-sector service providers.
The public media need leeway, but also clarification of their role and standards for fulfilling it.
It is in this respect that the communication from the Commission is particularly to be welcomed.
It also needs to be made clear, however, that, in the case of services with social welfare in mind, the type of transmission - be it terrestrial or videostreaming - cannot be crucial.
What matters are the objectives to be safeguarded, our democratic foundational principles, pluralism and free access to culture and to technological progress.
We must of course guarantee the protection of the users, especially of the young.
In terms of competition law, the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, must restrict itself to watching out for misuse.
It must continue to respect and defend the competence of Member States as regards the content of programmes.
Regulatory authority must then remain with the Member States, and it is therefore incumbent on them too to determine financial and organisational structures.
I welcome the fact the Commission and the Council are endeavouring to come to an arrangement with the Member States about this.
Mr President, Mr Philippe Herzog, who is the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee, is currently in Qatar as a member of the Parliamentary WTO Delegation and has, therefore, asked me to present the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on his behalf.
This was adopted by the Committee almost unanimously, with only one member casting a blank vote.
The draftsman does not share the Commission' s view that compliance with the rules governing competition and the internal market is fully compatible with safeguarding the supply of services of general interest.
The problem arising is how to safeguard the supply of such services.
The draftsman proposes the creation of a European joint responsibility framework to cover services of general interest. He considers that more open and more democratic regulation is a necessity, also in the conditions that will prevail following the potential enlargement of the EU.
The draftsman wishes to make the tasks clearer and at the same time to strengthen the communities' and states' freedom of choice regarding the selection of a model for safeguarding these services and the type of administration to be set up for this purpose.
While the current market philosophy and rules of competition encourage privatisation, the EU should retain the principle of diversity, or in other words, there should be a number of options to choose from.
On the basis of these arguments the committee has adopted an opinion according to which the gradual process of freeing service industries must be implemented in parallel with retaining general services.
The principle according to which it is up to the Member States, within their own territories, to retain their cultural habits and political views has also been adopted.
The Member States should have the right to ensure that services of general interest are also provided to the less advantaged of their citizens.
In paying particular attention to the problems presented by the financing and its safeguarding, the committee in its opinion shares the draftsman' s concern about the necessity to safeguard general services.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Langen, ladies and gentlemen, in a changing world in which global competition is growing and, indeed, becoming ever tougher, public services are among the essential cornerstones of the European social model.
Citizens, and indeed enterprises, of today, work on the assumption that a broad spectrum of such services will be generally available, with high quality and at affordable prices.
By 'services of general interest' is understood activities engaged in for the general good and therefore linked by the authorities with specific social welfare obligations and benefits.
Such services make a significant contribution to improving citizens' quality of life and thus play a significant part in maintaining the social, human and geographical cohesion of the European Union.
The subsidiarity principle clarifies responsibilities at regional and national level.
The meaning of 'social welfare interest' is laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It has therefore been important for me as President of the Austrian Welfare Service to clarify my position with respect to the major social institutions and health organisations, with the Red Cross, Caritas, the Welfare Service, the sports clubs, the fire brigades, the parishes and towns.
It was also important for me to observe that the specifically rural areas are involved, that the candidate countries through which the EU is to be enlarged are involved and that the significance of 'non profit organisations' in the service of the public is clearly expressed.
Today's report contributes to greater humanity in everyday life.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I think it is useful for Parliament to issue an opinion today on the report by Mr Langen, since the report is rather topical.
I think it is useful for us to issue an opinion prior to the Laeken European Council, as we are expecting this Council to give a great impetus to the redrafting of the notorious framework directive, the principle of which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is proposing that you adopt.
Furthermore, as regards the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, day after day I see judgments being passed, which show just how far ahead case law is on this issue, in comparison to our legislation.
In a judgment dated 25 October 2001, this case law again justified certain restrictions on competition where these are necessary for carrying out the task in question in order to achieve economic and social balance.
So, when you consider the timeliness of this framework directive, you must also consider the organisation of services of general interest.
And, from that point of view, this would mean knowing which authority is responsible for services of general interest.
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, we are calling for all levels of the European Union to be involved, whether at European or local level, both in defining the scope of services of general interest as well as in the ways that they are organised.
Our concern relates to consistency between the general approach towards services of general interest and the sectoral approach.
This is because there is no point defining the framework if there is a lack of cohesion between one sector and another.
Our group will therefore oppose a number of paragraphs which fall within a sectoral approach that we will not support.
I would lastly like to touch on the issue of funding.
The Commission recently proposed a new text which deals with an exemption regime in the sector of services of general interest.
We shall support this proposal which we believe must be supplemented by an approach that enables cross-funding, without which adjustments are not possible, and that threatens, over the long term, the functioning of general interest services.
Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the decisions taken in recent years by the Council and the European Parliament on the opening up to competition of hitherto protected sectors, in other words, monopolies, it has become clear that we must have solid legal bases in order to guarantee and develop services of general interest that are economically accessible to everyone and which therefore give substance to the status of citizens of the European Union.
In our view, the current economic situation and the numerous job losses that have been announced in recent weeks, coupled with the fact that, even during a period of strong growth, we have had an average unemployment rate of 8% in recent years, highlight the absolute need to develop services of general interest.
This is why our group fully supports the voluntarist guidelines drawn up, in the main, by the European Confederation of Trade Unions and by the European Liaison Committee on services of general interest.
Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam was a major step forward for Europe.
It is now deemed to be insufficient, and that is why we are supporting the draft framework directive and the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
We expect the Laeken European Council, part of which will be dedicated to the European Union' s objectives, to clearly set forth this objective on services of general interest and the framework directive as well as a timetable.
What is at stake is of crucial importance.
As in the case of procedures for public procurement contracts, which the Zappala report tackled, and as in the case of a particular sector such as public transport, which the Meijer report dealt with, we are required to adopt a framework for the policy on European competition, to develop a policy on regulated competition, to enable national, regional or local public authorities, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, to determine the missions of general interest services, the management contract that is to be fulfilled by the operators and the funding of these missions.
This is the purpose of Amendment Nos 52 and 55 that we have tabled.
We also think that we must insist on carrying out a much more in-depth evaluation on the liberalisation of sectors, taking into consideration the interests of consumers and workers and the compatibility of market guidelines with the objectives of sustainable development - I am thinking of the water sector, for example - and not only from a technical point of view, but equally through dialogue with all the actors involved.
This is the purpose of Amendment Nos 44 and 46.
The fact that it was necessary to present the various amendments to the House once again obviously indicates that what I have just said about objectives, and above all, about the resources to be implemented, has not received unanimous support.
Once again, in this field as in others, it is greater European integration that we need, whilst respecting the Community method and guaranteeing that public figures at all levels take the proper action to ensure the provision of general interest services.
Mr President, faced with the process of liberalisation and deregulation currently underway in the European Union, moves for proposals to be put forward and action to be taken in the field of public services have built up. The contribution of these has led to the fact that Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam recognises the essential role of services of general interest in ensuring social and territorial cohesion.
The Commission' s proposals, however, contain the usual double language. On the one hand, there is reference to the interests of citizens, and therefore to the need for services of general interest, whilst on the other, several of the Commission' s directives accentuate liberalisation and deregulation of public services.
The Langen report supports the spirit of the Commission' s communication of September 2000 on services of general interest in Europe.
The Commission acknowledges that competition cannot meet all the requirements of citizens and that Member States have good reason to set up and implement services of general interest.
At the same time, however, the Commission states that the progress of liberalisation is positive and relies on the content of the Lisbon meeting of the Council of Ministers to step up this process.
The report has been improved by the debate and the amendments.
It has made a real effort to adopt a balanced position between liberalisation and public services, it also stresses that services of general interest must ensure equal access, security of supply and continuity.
It also proposes to assess the actual impact of liberalisation before embarking on any new phases, as my group suggested on many occasions.
However, we still have a long way to go before we meet the required demands for services of general interest that are worthy of the name.
The Langen report claims to relentlessly pursue liberalisation in sectors such as transport, electricity and gas and the postal services.
Furthermore, it believes that it is necessary to privatise the water industry.
I think that services of general interest, as their name suggests, must be subject to the rights and obligations that the general interest demands. In other words, this means providing transparency, continuity and equality.
We need a new European model of services of general interest that meets citizens' aspirations, and we must stop approaching this issue solely from the point of view of competition, as advocated in the report.
That is why I do not think it is wise, and I think it could even be dangerous, to envisage a framework directive where we stick to this approach.
Yes, I believe that we need safeguards.
I am in favour of a framework directive on services of general interest on the condition that it maintains the social benefits that these provide in terms of employment, security and sustainable regional development.
This directive should also ensure the respect of service obligations in terms of quality, equality, access for all users, and also by maintaining reserved areas allowing price offsetting on a geographical basis and on social grounds.
I also think that all levels of the European Union must be involved.
Our position will be related to whether or not a number of amendments are accepted.
Mr President, this report on services of general interest in Europe deals with a field of tension between two significant blocs.
It is about the issue of a unitary competitive order in Europe, and about the self-government of communities or, in other words, about subsidiarity.
The focus of all this must always be the citizen, the consumer, and what services he receives, under what conditions and, above all, of what quality.
There are two points I find important in the communication from the Commission. It always speaks of an economic activity, with 'an economic activity' being very hard to define exactly.
If we in this House discuss what an economic activity is, the thinking of a very large number of Members is shaped by their national origin.
Is an economic activity to be affirmed when an enterprise works in a particular line of business for profit?
Let me mention only ambulance services.
The second is the issue of checking for misuse.
The question here is not whether the Commission can check on this, but in what detail it should, so that over-restrictive requirements do not result in a definition of general interest by the back door.
What is important is that we should be given communal responsibility and that we use it to choose one or other type of competition by means of public tender.
I would like, finally, to re-emphasise one thing that is mentioned in the report, but not in the communication from the Commission, namely the market in water.
For us in Germany and Austria, water is an extraordinarily important area.
I believe that as a matter of urgency we should reject the opening of the market in water, brought about by means of a decision on an individual case in the European Union - and the Commission has already requested an assessment on the subject.
We reject this decisively.
Examination of the sector-specific situation is in any case needed first.
I can therefore only warn the Commission not to take these steps.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the consequences of the internal market is that many things that were regulated in a quite specific way in the Member States are now subject to new and different rules.
Services of general interest are now an outstanding example of this, an example made more problematic by the additional factor that the objectives of services of general interest are similar in the Member States.
The instruments, however, sometimes differ significantly as a consequence not only of different cultural developments, but also of the Member States' differing administrative structures.
The drawing-up of shared rules is not exactly made easier by this.
The Member States must, however, continue in future to be able to decide what services they will categorise as being of general interest.
On the other hand, the rules must be as similar as possible in a common internal market.
Competition law, as laid down in the Treaty, provides on its own insufficient legal certainty when it comes to framing them.
On the other hand, the objective should not be to empty European competition law of its meaning.
It must therefore be interpreted in a binding way for the purposes of services of public interest.
We accordingly call for a framework directive to determine the Community principles on which services of general interest are to be founded.
This directive should lay down rules for the Member States.
Above all, though, it should provide legal security for those who provide services of general interest.
Thirdly, it should limit the space available for the Commission to exercise its discretion.
Its executive monopoly should not be infringed, but as far as its decisions in individual cases and its block exemption regulations are concerned, I would like to see it laid down what, for example, are 'economic activities' and what are not.
What falls at this arbitrary threshold?
When is intra-Community trade affected?
Above all, the many sectoral directives and regulations on which we are working at present must give direction to the legislative work in various sectors done by those of us in the European Parliament...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, the report is called 'Services of General Interest' in order to improve ways of handing over public services to private interests, and it calls for us to pursue liberalisation with unflinching determination.
Contrary to the misleading assertions made in the report, privatisation brings about poorer services and social discrimination that affects those on the lowest incomes. Activities are reduced or withdrawn in order to avoid making private profit, and these are still just as essential to the population.
And there can be no other approach.
The private companies that benefit from the erosion of public services are motivated by making maximum profits for their shareholders and not by the need to satisfy the general interest as best they can.
The policy to hand over public services to private interests is a policy pursued by the European institutions and the national governments, and represents a major social step backwards.
Education, health, public transport, postal services, telecommunications, water and energy supply, and refuse collection must remain public services which must not generate profits...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, the EU is trusting in liberalisation to ensure that services of general interest are sufficiently available.
If that means increased and fairer competition in postal services, transport, water supply, social services and so on, this can only be agreed to.
If, though, simple considerations of cost mean that the quality of service drops, with ever fewer service providers being available and ever fewer people being employed, this proposal merits political resistance.
State monopolies must not be replaced by private monopolies.
Mr Langen, the rapporteur, has taken on board my suggestion that tasks of general interest should be acknowledged to be common European values.
They contribute to the European social model and to the sustainable development of the EU's regions.
The aim is to guarantee high standards of quality and safety, range of provision and continuity in a healthy price/service ratio.
As before, the Member States' offers for tender will independently determine which yardstick to apply as regards environmental friendliness, availability and social standards.
It is for the good of all citizens if these services are unambiguously defined in the context of a European law on the placing of contracts.
Exceptions from the internal market's competition and market regulations should include local, social and charitable services which do not work with their eye on profit and are committed to meeting the needs of the weak and those on the margins of society.
Citizens and service users are to be comprehensively involved in the Member States' and the Commission's efforts to make this agreement reality.
New regulations on services of general interest in the EU will only be accepted if transparency and involvement are ensured.
As a member not only of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs but also of that on Employment and Social Affairs, I recommend that this House approve this report, which is excellent because it is balanced.
Mr President, I am concerned about a number of aspects in the Langen report.
Initially we have to address this question of services of general interest from the point of view of the rights of citizens, for the rights of consumers are a subset of those rights.
Citizenship confers rights which entitle one to various essential needs such as water, which is essential to human life.
Water cannot be treated within the European Union simply as a commodity to be bought and sold.
Europe is committed to the idea of a distinct social model based on solidarity.
It is therefore essential that we have a legal framework, a regulatory framework, within which the Commission and Member States can address the question of competition as it affects social services, public services, and services of general interest.
It is part of a democratic agenda for the European Union to ensure that we are accountable, that the services we provide are accountable, and that we have a Europe which is developed as a socially inclusive Europe.
The economy has to be an instrument to serve the people, not simply to serve the market.
Rights of the consumer being defined on the basis of purchasing power is not an adequate way to develop a cohesive social Europe.
It is a Europe where politics is denigrated because it is simply based on people's capacity to buy or not to buy.
Mr President, it is a particular pleasure to welcome the Langen report and the excellent work of the rapporteur in presenting a measured and forward-looking approach to the future provision of a category of services essential to our economy and to the wellbeing of all European citizens.
The Commission has played its part by presenting two communications on this subject and most recently a report to the Laeken European Council.
Essentially we are all inspired by the same will to ensure that every citizen in Europe has access to high-quality services of general interest.
The European Union has direct responsibilities with regard to those sectors for which internal market legislation has been introduced, essentially for network industries.
In each case, specific provisions have been devoted to public service obligations.
All this legislation has been adopted under codecision and is continuing to evolve.
The package of proposals on energy adopted by the Commission this spring comprises greatly strengthened elements relating to public service obligations.
Member States have a duty to specify and implement those obligations.
Elsewhere, in sectors not covered by specific Community legislation, Member States and their constituted authorities have the main role to play, for instance in the organisation and provision of local and social services.
Here the Commission limits itself to ensuring compatibility with competition and internal market rules in general. Those rules, as emphasised by the Langen report, are quite flexible.
In particular they provide for adequate financing of services of general interests.
The Commission has repeatedly been requested to provide greater legal security with regard to the general competition and internal market rules applicable to services of general interest.
By explaining and developing its approach, it has attempted to put the fears expressed by operators and others involved to rest.
The Commission proposes to continue to use examples, guidelines and communications, together with proposals for regulations on exemptions, to provide further clarification, as called for in the Langen report.
In its report to Laeken, the Commission has undertaken to establish a Community framework for state aid granted for services of general economic interest.
That framework could, in particular, specify the conditions for the authorisation of state aid schemes by the Commission, thus alleviating the notification obligation for individual aid.
This may lead to the adoption of a regulation exempting certain categories of aid from the obligation of prior notification.
On the issue of a proposed framework directive, the Commission is not opposed in principle and has already agreed to assess the value and feasibility of such an instrument.
Our doubts concern mainly the articulation between such a directive and legislation at sectoral level.
In the light of the European Parliament's resolution, the Commission will look at the subject again.
Another major issue concerns evaluation.
I repeat that the Commission has every interest in rigorous, complete and honest evaluation of the results of Community legislation.
That is good practice; it is also good governance and it should not be neglected, either at Member State or at European level.
We propose to improve on existing sectoral evaluations and we have agreed to present an annual horizontal report in the context of the Cardiff process.
The Commission welcomes the European Parliament's proposal to organise a debate in the existing forums in order to ensure a pluralist assessment and the debate ought to take place before the preparation of the Cardiff report in order to take full account of its results and recommendations.
In conclusion, I stress that services of general interest are an area of ongoing concern which will require new initiatives in future and further development of Community legislation.
The Commission looks forward to involving the European Parliament as a partner in this process.
Thank you Commissioner Bolkestein.
We shall now proceed to the vote.

Report (A5-0380/2001), on behalf of Parliament' s Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/308/EEC on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering[PE-CONS 3654/2001 - C5-0496/2001 - 1999/0152(COD)] Rapporteur: Mr Lehne.
Caveri (ELDR).
(IT) Mr President, I would like to point out to the Presidency that Article 3(6) of the Italian version still contains an error.
Last September, I wrote a letter to President Fontaine, pointing out an error in the Italian version of the text, the English, German and French versions of which were correct.
Replying in a letter of 4 October 2000, President Fontaine acknowledged that I was right and assured me that the translation services would correct the error. However, I regret to say that it is still there.
The meaning of the current version of the text, which reads: 'l' obbligo di identificazione previsto dalla presente direttiva si applica in ogni caso' (... shall in any event comply with the identification requirement laid down in this directive ...) - is completely different from the meaning of the other versions in the other languages.
As I told President Fontaine, the text should read: 'è comunque assolto dalle case da gioco' (Casinos ... shall be deemed in any event to have complied with ...) - which would make the text consistent with the other languages.
Thank you Mr Caveri.
We will, of course, take your comment, which would appear well-founded, into consideration.
I have to table a minor oral amendment at this stage, because I have noticed that there has been some misunderstanding as to the true intent of this text.
Certain Members of this House suspected me of wanting to weigh down Europe' s bureaucracy, while, in fact, I wish to achieve the opposite.
To clarify this, I will read out the text of the second part in English: "and for the same purpose, to foresee the creation of a specific European executive agency (agency with lower case) for cinema and audiovisual matters" .
The rest is therefore omitted.
I simply mean by this that the efficiency of the existing organisation in Europe is enhanced, and certainly not encumbered.

Report (A5-0347/2001) by Mrs Maat, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the Commission report on the experience acquired by Member States since the implementation of Council Directive 95/29/EC amending Directive 91/628/EEC concerning the protection of animals during transport [COM(2000) 809 - C5-0189/2001 - 2001/2085(COS)]
Mr President, I would like to point out two mistakes that need to be corrected in the French language version.
In Paragraph 10 of the French version, it says 'Treaty infringement procedures against Member States' , which is a misinterpretation.
What is meant is 'Treaty infringement proceedings against Member States' .
In Paragraph 16 of the French version, it says 'calls on the Commission to examine ways of promoting small-scale, local culling' .
Mr President, in order to avoid more serious culling, I propose - this sounds like a film called 'Petits meurtres entre amis' - I propose therefore that we put 'small, local abattoirs' .
Thank you for your suggestions, Mrs Auroi. I am sure our services will welcome them.

Report (A5-0361/2001) Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication 'Services of General Interest in Europe' [COM(2000) 580 - C5-0399/2001 - 2001/2157(COS)]
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, I would like to refer again to the vote, in which, alas, we lost the chance to vote on item 62.
I have again consulted the documents: item 62 is an addition to item 58, and we should in fact have voted on it by roll call.
Both my points of order were, unfortunately, ignored by your two assistants.
What is at issue here is that we make it simply and convincingly clear that the opening-up of competition in the water market cannot be achieved by means of general competition law.
I therefore want to reiterate this.
I stated in my opening statements that we reject this, and I ask that this be noted in the Minutes and that, if possible, Members' requests to speak should not be ignored in future.
I was not told about your request, Mr Radwan.
Mr President, you can ask your two comrades-in-arms.
The official sitting your left looked in my direction but did not inform you.
I cannot do anything about it either.
Mr Radwan, in my opinion, our colleagues do an extremely important job and do it with great care, but I can see that you are not interested in anything I might have to say.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Schmid, Gerhard report (A5-0362/2001)
The risk of manufacturing and circulating false euro notes and coins is a serious threat overshadowing the launch of the single currency, which will be present for several years following the physical changeover to notes and coins taking place on 1 January 2002. During this critical period, the confidence of our citizens is a vital factor.
It appears, however, that the danger was under-estimated, and then it was too late to deal with it.
The Commission only published its main communication on the subject on 22 July 1998, and it was in 1999 and 2000 that the first, but still incomplete, provisions were adopted on extending Europol' s mandate and the criminal penalties against counterfeiting of the euro.
The draft decision that we are examining today adds to these measures by establishing a Community training and assistance programme by the key players involved in combating counterfeiting.
Although there have been no major objections to the text itself, we can only stress, however, that it has arrived too late and that it contains some ambiguities, which arise from the design faults in the single currency.
First of all, the text before us constantly wavers between providing 'training' , and 'assistance' , and does not dare to state too clearly that, 48 days before the physical changeover to using coins and notes, cooperation in this vital area has still not been finalised.
Secondly, one of the objectives of the training and assistance programme is to protect the euro outside the euro zone, which is not actually an area of the Community competence.
From this particular perspective, we can see how shaky the single currency system is, one that is shared between Community competences and other competences that remain national, and both sides are poor at organising coordination.
But how could things be any different, as at Maastricht, the aim was to seduce the electorate into believing that the single currency was possible without having an absolute super State?
Lehne report (A5-0380/2001)
Mr President, I speak on behalf of the my group on the Lehne report.
Since the Tampere summit EU governments have been working more closely with each other on justice and home affairs and since 11 September this has become even more apparent.
Since we live in an internal market it is only right and proper that there should be some cooperation and coordination between the Member States.
International crime involves very sophisticated structures, but such operations centre on funding of criminal activities.
That is why it is important that we enact this legislation, to ensure money laundering does not take place within the EU financial systems.
We must ensure that international criminals cannot use existing financial structures in Europe, or indeed elsewhere, to launder their unlawful gains.
The implementation of this directive on prevention of the use of financial systems for the purpose of money laundering is an important element in the battle against international crime.
I have always believed that EU legislation in this area should be broadened to include offences other than drug offences. This is exactly what has been achieved here through the agreement between the EU governments and the European Parliament.
The directive extends the prohibition of money laundering to organised crime as well as drug offences.
Member States will remain free to extend their national anti-money laundering legislation to other forms of criminal activity.
As a result of the conciliation agreement, lawyers' professional secrecy will be safeguarded unless the lawyer knows that the legal advice sought is for money laundering purposes.
In a wider context there is agreement at European level to implement the framework directive on permitting the freezing of criminal assets within the EU.
The protocol relating to the convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters will also help EU governments when criminal proceedings take place in different Member States.
I support closer cooperation and coordination on justice within the EU, although I would caution governments to look very carefully at any conditions attached to future initiatives.
There must be proper procedures to safeguard civil liberties and rights and to maintain the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.
Mr President, I voted for the Lehne report on combating money laundering.
The French term used for money laundering is 'blanchiment des capitaux' , which literally means 'bleaching or washing capital' , that is, making something white which was not white before, cleaning something which is dirty, making an ugly thing beautiful.
Well then, I thought: why can we too not manage to be as clever as criminals, who do succeed in making ugly things beautiful?
Why can we not manage to make ugly things beautiful too?
I refer, Mr President, not to myself, who some people might consider ugly, but to the pension laws throughout Europe.
Will we manage to make those ugly laws - and there are a great many of them - beautiful?
The European Parliament and the Council have therefore reached agreement on a conciliation package that has the value of appearing to do something against money laundering related to drugs offences, whilst doing nothing at all.
Who can tell the difference between the proceeds from organised crime and those from normal economic transactions? Especially because the banking system itself does not want to make this distinction, as it believes that it is not the job of the banks to determine where the proceeds come from, only what the proceeds make.
And it is public knowledge that laundering of the proceeds from crime is not only carried out in tax havens; laundering also, and more importantly, goes on in the largest banks in the financial world.
If adopted, this resolution will certainly not prevent the proceeds from organised crime from passing through the financial system and from being invested in so-called normal activities, which are, in many cases, just as criminal as mafia money, if considered from a humane point of view.
It is absolutely scandalous to create one' s wealth out of drug money. It is equally scandalous to make a fortune from manufacturing and trafficking weapons.
And it is even more scandalous to allow pharmaceutical corporations and their shareholders to become rich from having a monopoly on trademarks of some medicines, when this monopoly increases the price of some essential medicines by ten times or more, condemning to death all those who do not have the means to pay these prices.
This is all legal however.
The European institutions may have the power to decide what constitutes a legal or illegal way to use the proceeds. They do not have the power to 'exonerate' the proceeds.
The directive on the fight against money laundering is a step in the right direction and is a response, at least in part, to the aspirations of the citizens' movements and to the proposals made by the judges who are the most involved in this issue.
The events of 11 September should, in fact, give us more reason to intensify the fight against money laundering.
The Lehne report does the opposite, however.
It welcomes a new paragraph, which is drafted in an absurd manner, since it states that 'Member States are not forced to impose the obligations, stipulated in the directive, on the professions concerned (members of the legal professions, independent or otherwise)' .
The sacrosanct professional secrecy is preserved, unless the legal advisor is himself involved in financial misdealing.
It is not enough for him to have 'specific reasons for believing' that 'his client wishes to obtain legal advice for the purpose of money laundering' . It is only if the lawyer 'knows' that this is the situation that professional secrecy can be lifted.
These delicate points clash horribly with recent, brutal decisions made by this very Parliament, which follows the example of the CIA and does not hesitate in wanting to make any individual demonstrating against financial crimes into a criminal.
In spite of these shortcomings, we did not vote against the Lehne report.
Maij-Weggen report (A5-0349/2001)
Mr President, I voted for this regulation on public access to European Parliament documents as well.
I have to say that, last Sunday, a pensioner from Bergamo, Mrs Erminia Santinelli, a young, active lady of 60, said to me: 'What good regulations you adopt at the European Parliament!
That might mean, then, that I will at last be able to see the documents as well!'
'What documents?' I asked her.
'The documents showing the way my pension is calculated,' she replied, 'for I still cannot understand how that figure was reached.
At last I will find out how my pension has been calculated, from the documents given to me to read.'
'Next time round' I told her.
'For the moment, we must be satisfied with reading the documents of the European Parliament.'
Mrs Maij-Weggen' s report on public access to Parliament documents is an advance we cannot but support.
We have, then, all voted in favour of 'the lesser evil' whereby a small advance towards more openness is better than nothing.
The problem is everything that is not included.
The main problem is that the Commission and the Council do not supply Parliament with documents from the phase during which legislation is prepared.
That is unfortunate in as much as it is this phase in which people have an interest in participating so as to be able to influence the content of the legislation.
A second problem is the division of MEPs into first and second class Members according to whether or not they have access to confidential information.
Moreover, it is completely insane and contrary to every parliamentary tradition that Parliament' s Committee on Budgetary Control, the ombudsman and the EU' s own Court of Auditors are never in a position to check all the documents concerning the Commission' s discharge of its office.
We voted against the report on 'Public access to Parliament' s documents' because this is a misleading title and the report aims not so much to widen the possibilities of access as to regulate them and, in doing so, grants the European Parliament the right to restrict public access.
On the one hand, we hypocritically acknowledge the right of the public to have access to documents, and, on the other, we admit that some of these documents are 'confidential' .
In actual fact, there is no reason why any document of the European Parliament or any other European institution, should be kept from the public.
We are in favour of the complete publication of all documents, all agreements, all treaties, as well as the details of all the speeches that are currently hidden, all the dealings that are kept secret, all the lobbying activities that have led Parliament, the Council or the European Commission to take a decision or to issue a directive.
. (NL) In days gone by, the interest of the state was protected from the citizen by secrecy.
These days, the impression is created that all government information is public in a democracy.
Despite this, there are quite a few exceptions on the basis of military or economic interests, and the extent of public access differs from Member State to Member State in the EU.
There are now two completely opposing views with regard to future public access to information in preparations for Community decision-making. The first opinion, expressed by the rapporteurs Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman, is that we have made great progress this year which will lead to optimal public access by 2002, with which everyone should be happy.
The second opinion, formulated by Messrs Martin and Bonde, and included in the amendments tabled by the Greens, is that the EP has, in fact, created unnecessary, self-imposed restrictions by striking deals with the Commission and the Council and that we have sadly not yet seen a majority in favour of total public access in this Parliament.
People may view the proposal as a step forward, but the most striking thing about it is what it is not saying.
Some of the documents of the Council and the Commission are still hidden from the public and Parliament.
I support the amendments which aim to further enhance public access.
Carnero González report (A5-0346/2001)
Mr President, I voted for the Carnero González report as well.
It would appear right that the same procedure applied when electing the members of permanent committees should be followed when electing the members of joint interparliamentary committees.
In any case, seeing as we are discussing how joint interparliamentary committees are elected, Mr President, I would stress the importance to the European Parliament of the joint committees including members of the parliaments of the candidate countries or including members of the countries with which we have close relations.
I call upon the European Parliament to confer increasing power upon these committees, for in that way we will see the fruit of the existence of the European Union and the European Parliament.
Cappato report (A-0374/2001)
Mr President, when, on 4 November, at the end of an important meeting I had held, in which I talked at length about Mr Cappato' s report - as you can see, Mr Cappato, like all the Members, is here in the Chamber to hear why I voted for his document, but I know that he usually watches me on the monitor in his office - I displayed his photograph, many young pensioners, instead of coming to ask for my autograph, which is what usually happens in large, important meetings held by important politicians, asked me to introduce them to Mr Cappato.
'We want to meet him!
He is a very good looking, extremely clever young man, and we congratulate him on this report!
Does this mean, then, that, at last, no one will know how old we are?
This is the sort of privacy we want!'
'Of course,' I told them.
This document will mean that no one will know how old a lady is.
.
The British Labour Members of the Socialist Group have voted in favour of national choice as to whether Member States will "opt-in" or "opt-out" on the reception of unsolicited commercial e-mails (UCEs).
This was the compromise reached in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
The revision of the e-commerce directive in 2003 will offer an opportunity to bring forward measures based on the experience of Member States which have opted in or opted out.
It is essential that any new measures in the area of e-commerce are based on direct experience of all those involved within the industry including consumers.
In the area of retention of traffic data, we believe that at second reading further amendments need to be considered.
We are all agreed that a certain level of protection of private life and of personal data is one of the foundations of a functioning democracy.
Modern means of communication and a recklessly expanding information society make this more important today than ever.
A wrongly-conceived protection of personal data can, however, have unwanted side-effects.
The Commission's text thus envisages a ban on advertising e-mails previously not expressly allowed by the consumer.
This so-called 'opt-in' principle flatly contradicts the principle, found elsewhere in the directive on e-commerce, that advertising is permitted unless the consumer has explicitly expressed a desire not to receive it.
This 'opt-out' of course costs nothing and requires no effort other than a simple click of the mouse, which is often sufficient for you to delete yourself from a database you do not want to be in.
Moreover, the e-commerce directive provides for several transparency conditions, so that, for example, advertising e-mails are recognisable as such by their titles and the recipient knows the sender before he even opens them.
An uninteresting e-mail can thus be deleted in seconds by the click of a mouse without the consumer having to waste further time, money or energy.
The unrestricted sending of advertising e-mails is, moreover, a boon particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, which cannot afford to make use of expensive advertising campaigns on television or in other media.
Cutting them off from this opportunity to introduce themselves to a wide public at reasonable cost would quite clearly mean giving an even greater competitive advantage to the big national and multinational enterprises.
These considerations mean that I will be voting in favour of the text adopted in Committee on 'unwanted information'.
As in the vote on this report on 6 September 2001, I now choose to oppose the position adopted by my political group when it comes to the rules for sending unsolicited advertising material out to consumers via e-mail.
Generally speaking, e-mail advertisements involve inconvenience for the consumer, partly because it takes time to open and delete advertising communications.
Moreover, it is the consumer who has to bear the costs of receiving and reading the advertisements The division proposed in the report between, on the one hand, e-mail advertisements and, on the other hand, advertisements via text messaging, fax and automatic calling I also consider to be artificial.
Whichever of these methods is used, it causes just as much inconvenience for the consumer, and an opt-in solution is consequently to be preferred to all other methods since it constitutes the most effective protection against unsolicited advertisements.
In view of how important it is for this report to be adopted by Parliament as soon as possible, the compromise that is on the table must, however, be viewed as an acceptable, if ultimately less desirable, alternative.
In the final vote, I therefore choose to support the report, irrespective of what transpires with regard to the aforesaid issue.
Turco report (A5-0370/2001)
Mr President, I voted for Mr Turco' s document because I am in favour of all situations in which there is cooperation and agreement between all the States of the European Union.
I talked about Mr Turco' s document during my meeting on Sunday 4 November as well. At the end, a lot of pensioners came up to me and asked: 'Does this mean, then, that we might have a European bobby on the beat at last?
We welcome any improvement in police activities coming from the European Parliament because here, in our State, we only have policemen who impose fines or come and arrest us.
It would be so nice to have friendly policemen!'
'This has not happened yet,' I replied, 'but I am sure that Mr Turco will take us another step closer in his next report and we might manage to achieve this too' .
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have, today, voted in favour of this report.
We agree that the EU and Europol should combat international crime and are therefore satisfied with the report as a whole.
We are nonetheless alert to the fact that certain amendments call upon legal cooperation and police cooperation to fall within the Community' s competence and that this is incompatible with Denmark' s reservation, cf. the protocol concerning Denmark' s position.
We do not support these amendments.
. (PT) On the pretext of fighting terrorism and the dangers inherent in deteriorating security, what we are seeing is the development and establishment of a huge, complex mechanism designed to limit freedoms, which could lead to the creation of a 'fortress Europe' in which this and other initiatives will be used as the reference point for the processing of personal data.
In the case of Portugal, for example, the fact that Europol considers the territory of Portugal to be the main point of entry into Europe, combined with the extension of its mandate to fight terrorism and organised crime, would turn our country into an area in which this body would feel particularly free to persecute and monitor people, unconstrained by the national police, the Minister for Home Affairs or by any real democratic control over its actions by the Portuguese Parliament.
These projects are intended to ensure cooperation between police forces, the information services and data filing systems, without any democratic control, under a restrictive and xenophobic immigration policy that infringes individual freedoms.
As a matter of fact, if there is no democratic control over the Schengen Information System now, what would be the case with regard to the transmission of information to third countries and bodies, largely sponsored by Europol and the American agencies, on the pretext of fighting terrorism?
Europol' s mandate must not take precedence over national policies or the control of Ministers for Home Affairs.
Its activities with regard to each country must be listed in internal security reports.
Europol must be subject, in all cases, to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and account for itself, in detailed reports, to the European Parliament.
Any extension of Europol' s powers must, of course, be subject to prior debate by the European Parliament and by the national parliaments of the Member States.
.
I strongly support this excellent report by Maurizio Turco which calls for the extension of Europol's mandate and the addition of other non-binding arrangements.
If Europol's mandate is extended to cover serious forms of international crime, such as kidnapping, illegal immigrant smuggling and racism, this body will become an institution with real biting power and one which can be seen as working in the interests and for the safety of European citizens.
Moreover, the Swedish proposal to allow the onward transmission by third countries of personal data received from Europol is particularly important.
It is well known that crime in the twenty-first century is borderless, and as such the EU should not and cannot operate Europol in a vacuum.
This is why it is essential that Europol works in conjunction with third party states since only then will its full effectiveness be realised.
Kirkhope report (A-0369/2001)
Mr President, I voted for the Council' s framework decision on joint investigation teams.
Forgive me, Mr President, for giving rein to my imagination, but while we were discussing European joint investigation teams, I imagined investigation teams which included women, dressed in the same uniform, a common uniform for policewomen.
I then wondered when we will vote on the type of uniform these women from the joint investigation teams are going to wear and who will model them so that we can give our opinions?
And who will chair the panel which will have to watch the fashion show of policewomen' s uniforms?
Might it be you, Mr President?
Or Mrs Theorin, who is chairperson of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities.
Anyway, joking aside, what I am trying to say is that I am in favour of joint investigation teams, of European policemen and women.
.
I strongly support this excellent report by Timothy Kirkhope which calls for a framework decision on setting up joint investigation teams.
This decision opens the way for the full implementation of the EU convention which calls for mutual assistance in criminal matters.
Police cooperation at EU level is a relatively new and innovative idea.
Without cooperation in these kinds of matters, individual Member States cannot hope to solve and combat the new kinds of crime that presently face all Member State police forces.
In addition, the report calls for joint investigation teams which should be available not only to combat drugs trafficking and human beings, but also to ward off organised crime.
Once joint investigations really take off and Member States come to fully realise their effectiveness, their remit could and should widen to include these kinds of issues.
Finally, as the report indicates, there is a real and valid role for the European Parliament in matters pertaining to joint police initiatives.
The call for some kind of review mechanism, whereby the Council accounts for and reports to the European Parliament on the effectiveness of joint initiatives, will make this process more open and transparent and therefore more legitimate.
Marinho report (A-0371/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, I voted for the Marinho report because it provides for the mutual recognition of court sentences and decisions on the implementation of the Schengen acquis.
However, as a representative of the Pensioners' Party, I am not in favour of the mutual recognition of decisions.
This is not something which furthers European integration: we need common rules in both civil and criminal law.
If we do not achieve this but are content just to implement mutual recognition of decisions, we will be taking a step backwards in the practical integration of Europe.
We will only have a Europe which is genuinely fully functional when we move on from the mutual recognition of decisions to common rules which are the same throughout the European Union. Then there will be no need to recognise the decisions of other States because the decisions of each Member State will be the decisions of all the States.
Vander Taelen report (A5-0351/2001)
Mr President, as representative of the Pensioners' Party, whose members include a large number of pensioners and elderly people who, having a lot of free time, watch the films and other products of world film-making either directly in cinemas or sitting comfortably at home in front of the television - a huge number of films are broadcast on television - I support Mr Vander Taelen' s document, which, like the Commission, calls for more support for European film-making.
I would stress, Mr President, the importance, as this document points out, of deciding to promote the circulation of European films, not just in Europe as it is today but also in the Europe of the future, in the enlarged Europe which includes the candidate countries.
If we really want to create a greater European culture than the one we have today, which, I regret to say, leaves something to be desired, it is vital that we dedicate even more funds to the circulation of European films within Europe.
The author of this report condemns the fact that the European film industry has been gradually stifled by the major Hollywood productions.
We did not vote against this report as we support some of its proposals.
However, we did not approve of the report either, because the root of the problem is that, as in many other industries, in art and literature for example, the film industry is, in the current economic hierarchy, simply a marketable product and that the film industry, as all other industries, has to obey the law of profitability.
Contrary to what the text claims to be nationalist feelings, the problem is not that of the domination of American cinema, but that of the domination of the major corporations, over the cinema market in the United States - where independent film-makers have just as much difficulty in holding out against the production of large companies as European film-makers - and over the global market.
The author of the report, a supporter, surely, of the market economy, is sensitive, however, to the irrational and harmful effect of the law of profitability in the film industry.
But the law of profitability is not more rational where consumer products, such as food, clothing, medicines or even jobs are concerned - it is, undoubtedly, more harmful still.
The Vander Taelen report announces the European Parliament's intention to promote the European film industry and reinforce it against the strength in the market of its American competition.
This concern also meets with the approval of the Group of Socialist MEPs, who have therefore voted in favour of the report, although they have substantial reservations about the statements made under item 8.
This is an attempt, detached from the debate just beginning on revision of the 'television without frontiers' directive, to force the amendment of one point in a particular direction, one highly dubious from the point of view of content and law.
Cultural, and therefore broadcasting, sovereignty belongs to the Member States alone.
Item 8 would in practice mean massive interference in the programming autonomy of both public-service and private-sector broadcasters.
It would, over and above that, offend against the authority of national public-service broadcasting organisations enshrined in the Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The success, or lack of it, of European audio-visual productions is not determined by extending protectionist measures, but by the marketability and competitiveness of such productions.
There is no doubt that a structural weakness is revealed by the fact that it is exceptional for European audio-visual works to cross the borders of their country of origin.
Consideration should therefore be given to systems of incentives for the distribution of non-national European films.
The restrictions described in Item 8 are, however, the wrong way to go about it.
The European film industry has problems distributing its films on the scale that we should perhaps wish.
The proposals put forward by the report do not however solve these problems.
They are based on the erroneous belief that increased State and EU aid can make an industry competitive.
They also show a lack of respect for free choice on the part of the consumer.
There is also a desire to impose a further item of expenditure on the European Investment Bank, parallel to the Bank' s main responsibilities.
If TV companies were to be forced to adjust their programming in the interests of European cinema, this would constitute an infringement of their freedom.
It might also be asked whether it is reasonable for European schools to be required to support the film industry through their teaching.
For these reasons, I have chosen to vote against the report.
Maat report (A5-0347/2001)
Mr President, I would like to say that it was with conviction that I voted for this report, for I hope that it will enable us to respond adequately to the demands of the people, the producers and all the consumers too.
I feel that we have erred in the past in that we have failed to implement and monitor the existing directive adequately.
In my opinion, the transportation of animals is a major issue and that it is something which almost all of us feel to be important.
It is no longer just an economic issue; it has taken on an ethical dimension.
Therefore, I welcome the increase both in regionalisation and controls, and I hope that, in the future, the contributions for the export of live animals will be abolished.
Mr President, how could I not vote for this document protecting animals, which, although certainly destined for a cruel fate, should at least be treated as beings that deserve our respect and our protection in matters of transportation, as Mr Ebner has just said.
However, I would ask you, Mr President, when we are going to do something for the dogs in Bucharest.
While we are on the subject of animals, Mr President, I cannot fail to take this opportunity to tell you about the stray dogs in the city of Bucharest. They have no owners and should be caught and sterilised, but, instead, they are the victims of indiscriminate hunting by the people of the city, who receive a reward for every dog they kill and whose body they take to the mayor as proof.
As I see it, the real villain is the mayor of Bucharest, not the poor dogs killed in the city.
I hope that we will soon do something to improve this situation as well.
Mr Fatuzzo, don' t forget to tell us what the mayor of Bucharest says when he reads your explanation of vote.
.
(NL) Animals are not products. They are living creatures whose well-being we must aim to protect.
Given the many cases of abuse during the long-haul transport of animals for slaughter, this transport should be abolished.
We have not got there yet, although the Commission measures are heading in the right direction, with the restriction on distance of 500 km and a maximum duration of 8 hours.
This will also help reduce the risk of spreading animal diseases.
That is why we have approved the report.
To date, the Commission has actually promoted this long-haul transport with its subsidy policy.
Similarly, the policy that has led to the disappearance of small slaughterhouses, including in remote areas, has had pernicious effects.
This policy should therefore be reviewed as a matter of urgency.
A great deal will depend on the policy of the Member States that have so far been very negligent, among other things by inadequately monitoring compliance with the animal welfare directives.
. (NL) Over the years, transport by road has become increasingly cheap, relatively speaking.
That is why all kinds of goods are continuously being hauled back and forth to places where the raw materials or labour are cheap, or where the expected profits are the highest.
It is even worse if living creatures are involved.
For example, discarded work horses from Eastern Europe are transported en masse to Western Europe to be slaughtered there.
During this transport, they incur fractures, they do not get any water or feed, and animal diseases are quickly spread across Europe.
Since a political majority wishes to protect the interests of the traders and carriers involved, various petitions organised over the years have failed to improve the situation.
Nearly a year ago, the European Commission responded to me that the solution is to improve the ventilation of animal trucks.
I fear that this non-legislative advice based on experience gathered from applying existing directives will not really solve the problem either.
However, the proposals by Mr Maat to limit transport for slaughter or fattening to eight hours or 500 km, to increase the penalties for infringements, to re-open the smaller, regional slaughterhouses that were closed down by EU legislation, and to abolish export subsidies for live animals for slaughter constitute a necessary step forward.
The deficiencies of current agricultural policy are evident.
The existing system only serves to promote the transport of animals.
This trade is, at least in part, truly absurd.
For example, Spain imports sheep for slaughter from the United Kingdom, while at the same time exporting sheep to be slaughtered in Greece.
We must aim to abolish the promotion of the transport of live animals.
It is indefensible in the long term that EU funds are used for this purpose.
The only possibility of putting an end to the long-distance transport of livestock lies in the regionalisation of agriculture policy.
The watchword must be: production in the market, for the market.
This would also make it possible to effectively counteract the spread of diseases.
.
I strongly support this excellent report by Mr Maat which reviews the 1995 directive designed to ensure protection for animals enduring long journeys.
The report is balanced and fair in that it recognises the possible negative role initially played by EU legislation: this called for the closure of many small slaughterhouses in the first place and made animal transportation more necessary and prevalent.
It also exposes the present lamentable situation whereby the provisions of the 1995 directive are often flouted and where some Member States fail to implement existing legislation.
The call for increased protection of animals during transit is both necessary and worthwhile; as the report indicates, this should be legally enforceable whereby those countries who fail to comply with the rules will be charged a fine.
This would act as a real and concrete disincentive for flouting the law.
In addition to the call for increased and harder legislation in this domain, practical measures are suggested, such as promoting the opening of small-scale abattoirs.
Lastly, this report calls for these tougher measures to be also applicable to third party countries.
This is both a positive and substantive move since EU Member States import livestock from outside the EU's borders and it would be counter-productive to have these enhanced rules operating exclusively in the EU without any regard for the unfair practices that operate outside its borders.
Langen report (A5-0361/2001)
The Commission' s communication of 20 September 2000 on services of general interest in Europe reviews its position in order to take into account recent developments in the case law of the Court of Justice, and also the will of Heads of State, expressed at various European Councils (at Amsterdam and Nice in particular) to show greater respect for the specific nature of the missions of public service.
This new communication, however, pushes us into a difficult position.
Apparently brimming with good intentions, the Commission is proposing to define the limits of public services and competition rules, to grant derogations for State aid to activities of general economic benefit, to put in place systems to evaluate the performance of public services and so on. In fact, the Commission is behaving as if the articles of the treaty on competition were universally applicable, and as if it was up to the Commission to say, out of kindness, the extent to which they will be applied.
The Commission is giving itself the role of arbitrator. The treaty, however, does not give it any right to do this.
Although the Treaty of Rome only mentioned public services in passing, this is because those who drafted the treaty thought it went without saying that public services did not fall under European competences.
Even Article 16 of the TEC, introduced under the Treaty of Amsterdam, does not amend this position.
We must, however, be very attentive to the Commission' s attempts to wield imperialist powers.
We believe, in particular, that the memorandum issued by France on 27 July 2001, despite being full of good intentions, falls into this trap, by proposing to draft a framework directive to set objectives for services of general economic interest and also the freedoms and obligations of Member States with regard to these.
This is another example of a European text that can be interpreted in many different ways and is subject to European arbitration.
In reality, all we need is a new article in the treaty to confirm the evidence, in other words, the sovereign right of Member States to define and organise their public services independently, whether these are general services or services of economic interest.
We were unable to support a report that places us in the position of observer.
Too many amendments, which could give a sign that a change is underway in tendency and approach, as we expressed in Amendment No 59, were not adopted today.
To leave public services to the mercy of the rules of competition is to seriously threaten the regional development and the social cohesion of our States.
This represents a step backwards for users and is being taken with disregard for the principle of subsidiarity, which is, in fact, emphasised in all our texts.
This new move is a lost opportunity for the European Parliament to show that it is listening to its citizens.
As far as we are concerned, we will continue to fight so that the Laeken European Council becomes the opportunity to take a step forward for the good of citizens.
At the Lisbon European Council in March 2000, European governments decided to 'increase the pace of liberalisation in sectors such as gas, electricity, postal services and transport' .
The Commission and the European Parliament, by means of the Langen report, are supporting this process of 'selling off' the methods we use to meet our citizens' basic social needs, and are thus strengthening the domination of markets over our societies.
We all know, however, that in sectors that have already been liberalised, the expected gains in productivity have not been met; that the erosion of public services has caused standards of quality of service and of safety to fall; that, for employees, the 'gradual and controlled' opening up to market forces has led to staff cuts and greater job insecurity, and has caused inequalities in regional development.
Is this the European model of society that the European Union desires?
We believe that we must urgently block the liberalisation process and re-appropriate public services by freeing them from the markets.
Regarding the liberalisation of services of general interest, we are opposed to coordinating public services at European level, and even creating public Euro-services within the framework of common policies of general interest, through state-owned businesses, involving users and employees, over the long term, and making use of the most advanced techniques.
We reject the Langen report for this specific reason.
.
The ELDR Group voted against in the final vote on the Langen report, because its members are not convinced that a framework directive on services of general interest (SGI) is a good idea.
At least we want to wait for the Commission's reflections on the desirability and feasibility of a framework directive on SGIs before we insist on such a proposal.
Another reason for our vote against is the ambiguous wordings on the need to stick to the Lisbon agenda.
We found that the text was too watered down (for example in the votes pertaining to par. 33).
Liberals also find that the report, through amendments both in committee and in plenary, had become too long, inconsistent and incoherent and that it therefore, unfortunately, no longer presented any added value to the debate on SGIs.
Passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterway
The next item on the agenda is the Report (A5-0364/2001) by Mr Meijer on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council [COM(2000) 7 - C5-0326/2000 - 2000/0212(COD)] on action by Member States concerning public service requirements and the award of public service contracts in passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterway.
Mr President, many private companies have withdrawn from public transport since it became permanently loss-making as a result of the large-scale distribution of the car.
Public transport is necessary for access, the environment and for reducing the pressure on public space and cannot survive without extensive government funding.
Like education and welfare provisions, public transport is more a core task of the government than it is part of the market.
Unfortunately, this Regulation has been preceded for some years now by a rumour in a number of Member States that the EU is committed to privatisation and competition.
When I was appointed rapporteur a year ago, I was put under pressure to have the report ready for first reading in the first half of 2001 during the Swedish Presidency of the Council.
Had I succumbed to that pressure, it would have been impossible to have more than one hundred investigative interviews with organisations, including national associations of municipalities, trade unions and different types of transport companies.
I gleaned very opposing interests and views from these conversations.
Public transport is regulated very differently in each Member State and in each of its regions.
Much community funding has gone into buying up old private companies that failed to offer adequate public transport, particularly in densely populated urban areas and for rail connections.
This is in contrast to many small bus companies operating a few bus services in thinly populated areas that have now been bought by large, fast-growing bus companies operating in different States.
If the European Commission is of the opinion that the award of contracts for transport areas to such companies should not be based on nepotism or judicial verdicts but rather, on objective standards and openness, then this Parliament shares this point of view, and so does the rapporteur.
In this way, the Commission helps those areas where the municipal or regional governments would like to contract out their public transport apply useful rules so as to be able to choose between a few large companies, such Arriva, Vivendi or Deutsche Bahn.
Unfortunately, the Commission proposal applies the same obligation to contract out to areas which, based on practical experience, prefer the sustainable existence of one of the country' s own public companies or the continuation of a long-term contract with a small, private company.
Precisely this restriction of freedom of choice makes the Commission proposal extremely controversial.
It particularly affects countries such as Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Germany and Austria.
But also in the Netherlands, which led the way in privatisation and liberalisation, the disadvantages of a disorganised rail company and of delayed growth in public transport in densely populated areas are now emerging.
The rule that applies to every government is that it is appreciated by the people if it helps solve problems and maligned if it creates unnecessary problems.
European legislation can be useful if it makes a vital contribution to solving our joint and cross-border problems.
Far-reaching, centralistic intervention in municipal and regional policy certainly forms no part of this.
No one will be satisfied if such intervention soon appears to result in fewer public services, higher consumer prices, worse working conditions, fewer new tram lines, the termination of free urban transport, the supremacy of a monopoly and the erosion of democratic participation.
The compulsory introduction of competition in this case does not mean the emergence of an ordinary market; instead it means promoting a battle for securing government subsidies for permanently loss-making businesses that want to take over government tasks.
According to many experts, the introduction of an obligation to tender for passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterways goes beyond the powers of the European Union.
On account of this obligation, the importance of providing public services and the well being of the user are being subordinated to attempts to cut down on labour costs.
If this proposal for a regulation were to be accepted unamended, it would spell doom for small companies, including virtually all public companies.
Although the municipal tram company or the local bus company can also take part in the tender, these companies will go under as soon as they lose the tender at some point in the future.
Only large, cash-rich companies with many diverse transport areas can survive such a system in a sustainable manner.
It is exactly this crucial aspect of the tender obligation pertaining to all public transport that attracts criticism.
On 10 October, it appeared that the majority of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism had accepted the gist of what I had proposed or what Mr Piecyk and others had developed by way of alternatives on the back of my proposal. Tram, underground and short bus services remain outside the obligation, while employment and the environment are better protected.
If the plenary follows the same line of thinking, we could save ourselves a great deal of upheaval and bother.
Mr President, it is with particular pleasure that I contribute to the debate on a very important report dealing with the opening of the market to competition in key parts of our public sector.
The Committee on Legal Affairs considered that the key elements of the proposals were sound, but differed in its opinion on a number of key issues.
Firstly, some of the amendments proposed gave exemptions to what are known as integrated transport systems, yet we all know that transport, and particularly integrated transport, is a matter of organisation and not ownership.
This would merely be protectionism by the back door.
Secondly, there was concern that some of the proposals would allow for predatory bidding by exempted sectors for those parts of the transport industry which, in the case of my own country for example, are already liberalised.
Thirdly, the de minimis provisions failed to meet realistic levels to allow competition to take place in the open market.
Finally, there was concern that the level of public subsidy taken into account in drawing up contracts would not allow the continuation of socially needed routes nor provide adequate recognition of contribution towards fares, for example for the less fortunate, such as the elderly or disabled.
The report which finally emerged goes some way to addressing these issues.
However, I fear that some of the amendments included in the final report would also introduce extraneous non-commercial considerations into what should be a completely open and transparent competitive system within the EU.
For example, the issues already mentioned relating to environment and social policy are not in themselves relevant to the contract tendering process but should be dealt with under separate legislation.
That is why I draw your attention to these matters and why this report should be seen as merely the first step towards the liberalisation of the market in this sector and not as an end in itself.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. (FR) Mr President, I can say that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has been asked for its opinion, widely supported the proposals put forward by the European Commission.
In a series of amendments which were passed on to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Commission was careful to extend the length of contracts, for which operators apply in response to calls for tender.
The Commission also tabled a number of amendments to increase the content of management contracts set out in the Commission regulation, particularly under the social chapter.
Lastly, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs supports the idea that we must ensure that the objectives of sustainable transport are taken into consideration in the management contracts and this is duly taken into account by the competent authorities, particularly with regard to the integration and interoperability between bus transport, which is precisely the subject of our debate, and other types of transport.
Nonetheless, the Committee regrets that this proposal for a regulation was presented before a discussion could be held.
With regard to rail issues, the second railway package and also services of general interest, which we discussed this morning, it would clearly have been more logical to first adopt a framework directive on services of general interest before having to discuss the same services of general interest on a sector-by-sector, directive-by-directive basis.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Meijer, I would like to say in advance that I actually want to say a word of thanks to you, as I know with what commitment you have sought to introduce this subject and how many discussions you have had in order to produce some sort of proposal.
I must, though, say on this point that I cannot go along with broad areas of your proposal.
There is, in principle, nothing new about what we are discussing today.
When, in the summer of 2000, the regulation at last emerged from the Commission, reached Parliament, and then the first discussions were held with trade unions and the representatives of local transport bodies and voluntary organisations, everything was clear: There was to be controlled competition.
This had been the aim for years, and now we only had to deal with the questions of how long future contracts should run for and when the regulation was to enter into force, in other words, when would the first tenders actually be invited and the first contracts awarded?
There was the additional question of what exceptions there should be to the obligation to put contracts out to tender.
All that had its part to play, as did the recurrently raised issue of social dumping, that is, the danger that tenders would lead to the employment of especially cheap labour.
We came to a consensus.
We wanted controlled competition without privatisation.
The two are always confused with one another.
Privatisation is not automatically connected with it.
All that is involved is that local transport bodies no longer automatically come into the enjoyment of substantial subsidies from regional, national or local funds without having to compete for them, but contracts will now have to be put out to tender.
We all know that local transport bodies, who know this themselves, basically offer their product at too high a price.
The cause of this is to be found in the fact that it is in the public sector that trade unions have always been very successful in pay negotiations in recent decades.
It is a truism, to give just one example, that the personnel costs of private bus companies are some 35-40% lower than in the public sector.
Competition also opens up the possibility of us being in a position, in the future, to buy in transport services more cheaply, without a local authority being able to evade its responsibilities in the process.
It is not the case that they are being privatised.
There will continue to be a State office with responsibility for ensuring that public transport carries on.
I can see the opportunity of using the resources saved by buying-in transport at more favourable rates to buy in more transport in the future, thereby making short-distance transport more attractive and achieving all that was said at the outset, namely making transport so attractive, that more people will use it in the future.
Let me say that, following these lengthy preliminaries, I think there has almost been a catastrophe, because Mr Meijer was evidently unsure which way he should go, and proposed that, in future, the responsible bodies, whether the regional or local government, should be entitled to decide whether or not to invite tenders.
I forecast that if this right to choose, which is to be introduced into the bill by means of Amendment No 61 and Article 7a, becomes reality, there will be no competition, because pressure from the transport companies, trade unions, and associations will be so great as to be irresistible, and contracts will continue to be awarded automatically.
Though we can disagree about many details, I therefore beg you, ladies and gentlemen, to seriously reconsider your decision tomorrow and not to vote in favour of Amendment No 61, so that contracts will continue to have to be put out to tender, exceptions being made for rural areas where only small sums are involved, but let us march in the same direction.
Mr President, you will not be surprised to learn that I see things in quite the opposite way to Mr Schmitt.
What is true is that we need a European legal framework for public local transport, as there is legal uncertainty and the market has already been opened up.
The question is, though, how closely to the citizens Europe's decisions must be taken on a given subject.
Local public transport is, in my view, primarily the responsibility of local authorities and that is how it should stay.
Towns and parishes should themselves decide whether they want to run their local public transport by their own enterprise, and then whether they are able to do so.
It is also clear that those who say they are going to do it themselves must not be allowed to compete elsewhere.
I wish to thank Mr Meijer, the rapporteur, for pursuing this basic idea with, if I may say so, a certain stubbornness, as this issue of community decision-making is an important point.
My second point is that where there is competition in local public transport provision, it can lead to minimal wages and social dumping.
My dear Mr Schmitt, a bus driver working on regular services does not earn a fortune - barely DM 200 above the social security rate in Germany.
It is for that reason that social minima must be maintained when there is a change of operator.
My third point is that local public transport is run in many Member States' rural areas by small and medium-sized enterprises.
These must not be unnecessarily squeezed out of the market, quite the contrary.
I believe they must also have a chance in the market when routes or networks are awarded directly.
The situation prevails in any case, in many areas of Germany, that up to 90% of local public transport is to and from schools, and here too, the direct awarding of contracts must be given more of a chance.
I think we can agree that the Commission's time limits for contracts and handing-over are both too short, and we strove together for their extension.
As regards the other things, our opinions simply differ and, unlike Mr Schmitt, I believe that tomorrow will not see a catastrophe, but that we will be very close to the communities in deciding in their favour on public local transport.
Mr President, I wish, first of all, to thank the rapporteur, Mr Meijer, for preparing the report; he has done a great deal of work on this complicated issue.
The interests of passengers must be borne in mind in the development of public transport.
It must be made into such an attractive alternative that more and more people will be happy to opt for public transportation.
This is highlighted particularly in towns where it is necessary to find ways of solving environmental problems and the difficulties caused by traffic jams.
Signing agreements when organising public transport services is the correct procedure in cases where such agreements enjoy public subsidy.
With a combination of open and controlled competition it is possible to achieve a higher degree of efficacy and a better level of service.
Competition is also really needed in this industry.
There should be some room for flexibility in the application to enable Member States to retain any proven procedures that they have applied previously.
In my own home country such successful solutions include the fixed route transport licensing system and the town and district ticket systems.
This is corroborated by an amendment relating to Article 3, item c.
The aim of this is to prevent the formation of local and regional monopolies and to enable competition as far as possible.
Another objective is to safeguard public transport systems that function well in countries with sparse populations where distances are great.
Arguments relating to transport safety and to minimising the number of accidents are also in favour of the public transport option.
For these objectives to be achieved, legislative flexibility is called for.
It should be possible to opt for solutions that are best suited to various conditions and to each operating environment.
Such solutions should be practically oriented and they should be implemented in cooperation with local and regional operators.
Mr President, the main problem with the Commission's proposal is that local public transport is subordinated to the objective of 'free competition' alone.
Some in this House may well welcome this, but I consider it a fundamental error.
It is the objectives of transport policy that local public transport must primarily serve.
It is also a European issue, how can the local public transport service improve the mobility of all citizens, including those who, not being car-owners, have no alternative to it, schoolchildren, large families, pensioners, disabled people, people on limited incomes?
Ensuring sustainable basic mobility in accordance with town and country planning is therefore the prime objective for local public transport.
Specific local situations mean that this can be achieved in a wide variety of ways.
So, to this day, I cannot understand why the Commission chose to do this by means of a regulation without considering the possibilities afforded by a directive, as this is a typical case where the subsidiarity principle applies.
I also wonder how it is that the Commission is also choosing the form of the regulation, at the same time as bringing out the White Paper on European governance.
According to this White Paper, it wants to reinforce local autonomy, and here it is interfering.
Hence the question as to how such a regulation can make real the principle of reinforced local autonomy in European governance?
Let me finally return to the offering of contracts for tender.
Of course contracts must be put out to tender.
But the process must highlight firstly transport policy, secondly environmental policy and thirdly social policy, which should lead to optimised mobility for our electorate.
Mr President, my colleague Erik Meijer's report is of the greatest interest, as it touches on a core issue in services of general interest, that is, the guaranteeing of citizens' mobility within their immediate surroundings.
This fundamental citizens' right was formerly predominantly guaranteed by local public services and their agents.
As local public transport is mainly unprofitable, services are subsidised by the local authorities, which of course makes the local transport market interesting for private-sector service providers.
The public local transport market in Germany alone is valued at some DM 30 billion.
The creation of the internal market and the rise of international companies offering public transport services has led to a conflict between the previous practice of awarding transport concessions directly to local service providers on the one hand, and the international firms on the other.
The Commission has therefore proposed to give competitive rules the edge over public interest and to create a new and binding obligation to put contracts out to tender.
The rapporteur is, in my view quite right to question this procedure.
He would give local authorities the right to decide for themselves how contracts are to be awarded.
That is democracy; that is the subsidiarity principle.
There must be no interference by the European Union in the conditions applied at local and regional level.
I see this as a fundamental issue, as it is evidence of real subsidiarity.
I appeal to my fellow Members of this House, although I know that there is little point in doing so, to support this position.
We had many meetings and discussions with local, regional, national and international operating companies and interest groups, so of course highly detailed proposals were the result.
Now, you do not have to agree with all these suggestions, but the basic line taken by the Meijer report corresponds to the demands of local public transport as seen by local authorities and operators, does not, contrary to what you said, Mr Schmitt, exclude the possibility of introducing competition, and safeguards local and regional transport services accessible to all and which citizens can afford.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, we should begin by saying to those watching us, who have found their way here in greater numbers than we MEPs, that we do not differ as regards our objective.
We all want the best possible local public transport at the lowest cost to taxpayers and passengers.
That is our common objective.
We now have to deal with the question of how best to go in that direction.
If your proposal is propaganda from the left of this House for the right of communities and regions to exercise free choice, then I can only say that the past fourteen years have demonstrated that free choice is to the citizens' disadvantage.
What, then, is the position?
In most towns and communities, services by the communities are being reduced and the subsidies are on the up and up.
So the reality is that we cannot carry on with the present system if we want a good, efficient, public transport service at local and regional level.
So we say we must put them out to tender, so that citizens get the best modern buses at the best price, with the best quality, and arriving as often as possible.
That is the objective we have set.
I can tell the gentleman from the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities that, secondly, there is the Community Treaty, the Treaty on the European Community, in which it is stated that everyone shall have the right to provide services.
Freedom of services can be restricted only on the basis of a greater good.
The free will of a village community is not sufficient to say that one should limit the freedom of services under Community law in village A or village B. You need carefully-controlled legislation to be able to limit the freedom of services by reason of a higher good.
That is what we are doing.
If, though, you give communities back their free choice, you are suspending the justification for limiting the freedom of services, so, no matter what we agree on, be it journey times or whatever else, we need a proper framework for a controlled competitive order, and the free choice you propose undermines that, as we need sensible Community regulations to limit the freedom of services.
Mr President, I feel that it is perfectly legitimate for the European Union to equip itself with common rules whenever we introduce competition into local public services.
I feel that it is infinitely less legitimate to seek to withdraw a method of management and to introduce competition within the field of transport and to use case law to extend this to all the other fields in the future, through a regulation which is not transposed by the national parliaments.
I have several reasons for this view.
The first is that the private sector has not always performed better and I urge my fellow Members to come and see what is happening in France, in the water industry, which has been largely opened up to the private sector.
Cartels have sprung up, which are no longer controlled by the local authorities and which currently supply water at higher prices than the local authorities, which remain under direct management.
On the other hand, we must not consider direct management to be a better method, but simply that the two methods of management must co-exist.
Secondly, this goes against the principle of subsidiarity.
If subsidiarity means anything at all, then it most certainly means the freedom of administrative choice of local authoridies and the constitutional provisions of most Member States, under which decentralisation now gives freedom of choice to the mayors, regional leaders and heads of local authorities.
There is therefore a genuine political problem posed by this regulation.
I do not think anyone can deny this.
Lastly, we must also be very clear on this question. Whenever a mayor chooses direct management, he cannot turn to external markets.
Who knows of a school bus service, in a rural area, managed by the local authority, that has to rely upon external markets?
This is not a problem that exists in reality.
On the other hand, whenever public services are delegated or an exclusive choice is made by a business, which is, itself, competitive, this company can turn to the external markets.
That is why I believe that we must impose the principle of reciprocity.
In any case, however, we cannot give up direct rule as a method of management.
Mr President, to get legal clarity on tendering rules in the EU, unfortunately the committee voted to delete most of the specific exemptions in favour of one very wide one, Amendment No 61.
But it is open to legal and political challenge to simply cite democratic decision-making as a justification for exemption from EU legal rules for the internal market.
I therefore commend the specific amendments from the ELDR Group - Amendments Nos 110 to 112.
These would mean that authorities would be justified in not tendering metro and tram services if there were good reasons of cost, safety or risk of creating a permanent private monopoly rather than competition.
Any claim for exemption would have to be justified to the European Commission.
In addition, there are provisions for direct award of contracts in the absence of tenders or in emergencies.
I appeal in particular to the left of this House.
You take a big risk if you rely only on Amendments Nos 61 and 62.
They may not survive the course and as an insurance policy we need specific provisions to protect large complex metro systems like London's from being split up for tendering or risking becoming a private monopoly.
Mr President, European transport policy is not really a page of glory in the annals of the European Union.
Too little, too late, not really consistent, those are only some of the features criticised as being characteristic of European Union policy to date and justifications for criticising it.
The present Commission is investing a lot of commitment in attempting to counteract this.
The proposal for a regulation on local public transport belongs to the legislative package with which some past errors are, admittedly belatedly, to be repaired.
Some of the internal market philosophy is also to acquire significance in the transport sector.
Controlled competition, not total liberalisation and certainly not privatisation at any cost, was said to be on the way.
One unfortunately has to say 'was' as what the competent Parliamentary Committee has produced as a compromise signals a return to the old and unsatisfactory situation.
In order that there may be no misunderstanding between us, let me say that there is consensus on all the points concerned with the quality of the transport offered to the consumer, consensus also on demands for high standards of safety, social provision and environmental protection.
All that, though, can be, and is to be, required and put into effect by the conditions on the offering of contracts for tender.
So we do not need the continuation of monopolies and quasi-monopolies.
Finally, I will say something about subsidiarity.
It is no help to local autonomy to declare local public transport to be a res extra commertium, whose watchword is that everyone is to do what they like in the way they like.
It is, unfortunately, no help to the citizens either, for it is they who, at the end of the day, have to pay for all that twice over, as consumers and as taxpayers.
So, then, controlled competition and high standards for local public transport as well.
Mr President, I believe that public transport is incredibly important for Europeans in both towns and sparsely populated areas.
In this vote, I am therefore going to support the basic ideas behind the committee' s proposal, which I believe points in the direction of better public transport.
However, I oppose many of the simplistic statements made about tendering.
Our experience from Sweden shows that tendering can be very good.
Account can be taken of the environment and of social considerations, safety regulations can be established and a good relationship can be enjoyed with the social partners.
As a prerequisite, politicians must have responsibility for the tendering and establish these criteria openly.
That is possible, as is shown by experience from Sweden.
We should be able to get rid of many of the simplistic statements about tendering.
As I say, I am prepared to support the basic idea that regions and administrative districts should have freedom of choice.
I also believe that it will, in practice, emerge that tendering can be used because it saves money that can be used for other purposes within the framework of public expenditure.
Finally, I want to say that I do not believe that the rule of reciprocity referred to in the committee' s report should operate at European level.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, the likely reason for the Commission's proposal being such a centre of attention is that we are dealing here with employment, especially with mobility, and with issues of safety, environmental protection and economic development as well, and the opinions which are still being vigorously discussed today were also the basis for almost 500 proposed amendments.
I would like at this point to again make clear that, for us, it really is not about opening up local transport in such a way that it inevitably ends up in private hands.
Nor is it about local transport remaining in public hands unconditionally, and that is the subtle distinction that we want to make clear now.
National, regional and also local government are to be obliged to put local transport out to tender, a process to which conditions must be attached, conditions which we have clearly described in numerous proposed amendments.
For us, it is about safety.
It is also about certain exceptions, small markets in rural areas, for example.
We, of course, view these exceptions with sympathy, as we do the special aspects associated with rail transport.
As has just been said, though, our misgiving cannot be dispelled that many are more interested in the service provider than in the service itself, for the word 'voter' was just used rather than 'citizen', something that we find symptomatic of the whole discussion we have been having.
We have brought in numerous amendments and can, I believe, say quite unambiguously that these amendments prevent social dumping and also guarantee social security, safety in general, and, I believe, can give local transport a better future.
One final observation, with which I know the Commission has difficulty. Protected markets make it impossible, in our view, for businesses profiting from them to take part in tendering processes in other markets without, at least, some problematic aspects being created.
As we see it, that is, and cannot be other than, unfair competition, which must be combated by all means available.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to the Commission for showing that they have the courage to present, in the past year, a proposal for a regulation on the thorny topic of local public transport.
For we are not going to get away from the fact, as we see at this very moment in the case of an airline, that even in local public transport, profitability is making an entrance.
We cannot therefore have the situation in which - I am involved in local politics myself - year after year, questions about the losses sustained by local public transport are simply shrugged off without further ado and with the taxpayer being left to foot the bill, without the money actually being able to be invested in making local public transport more attractive.
We have to ask ourselves: why was local public transport created?
It was not created in order to employ as many bus drivers as possible; on the contrary, it was created so that attractive facilities can be offered in rural and more densely populated areas to ensure the mobility of all.
That is the task that is incumbent on local public transport.
I think that Mr Grosch's point that we need a level playing field in a European single market is decisive.
We cannot have the situation in which we introduce freedom of choice that makes it possible for certain districts, because they are under financial pressure or because they want to invest their taxpayers' money properly, to invite tenders, and then these are submitted by firms from protected monopolies.
It is therefore so important that this Amendment be voted down tomorrow, so that there may be a level playing field.
The Commission has laid down very tight deadlines for the duration of licences and for transitional regulations.
I think we, as a committee, reached a fair compromise between the various interested parties.
I would, in fact, like us to make a start on introducing time limits and licensing systems throughout Europe.
Commissioner, we will be able to talk about this at future stages, in order to make it even more competition-friendly.
However, let us take this first step together.
This is for the good of the people of Europe.
Mr President, as one of the previous speakers said, what we are all after is the best possible public transport at the lowest possible cost.
As another speaker said, we need appropriate solutions for each particular environment.
That is the main reason why the principle that local authorities can be free to decide how best to organise public transport within their own areas is such an important one.
I would like to make a few comments about running metro systems in large urban areas such as London, where there is a real danger that if we do not allow local authorities to make those decisions, the contracting out will lead to the creation of a monopoly and we will not be any further forward in what we are trying to achieve with this report.
The other thing that could happen in areas such as London and other large cities is that the system could be broken up, which could lead to quite severe chaos.
So I would urge you all to support Amendment No 61.
Mr President, I strongly support the principle that high quality and reasonably priced public transport should be available in all areas.
However, this report is particularly important to my constituency, Wales, due to issues relating to concessionary travel.
The Welsh National Assembly has introduced a scheme, which will come into force next spring, whereby local bus travel will be free for all pensioners in all areas of Wales.
The scheme would offer free bus passes and free travel on local buses and would theoretically enable pensioners to travel throughout Wales if they wanted to without paying a penny.
Whilst I appreciate the importance of ensuring that groups such as disabled people, schoolchildren and trainees are also eligible for reduced cost public transport, it would be ridiculous to undo the good work the National Assembly has done for pensioners in Wales by preventing pensioners enjoying concessionary travel under this regulation.
I am pleased that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has already voted to abolish the ceiling on concessionary fares that was proposed by the Commission, thereby protecting these pensioners in Wales.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Meijer, for the work he has done; it has been complex and complicated work on a proposal which has given rise to many amendments and positions.
The good work by Mr Meijer, and by all of you, has led to an important debate in Parliament.
In many ways, this debate has helped to generate another broad public debate.
The analyses of this subject, both inside and outside the institutions, help the Commission to improve on its own ideas.
The debate has demonstrated the controversy surrounding these issues, although there have been times when feelings have obscured the real background to the proposal we are dealing with.
Firstly, at the moment there is legal uncertainty in this sector and our intention through this proposal, ladies and gentlemen - we must make this very clear - is to resolve a situation of legal uncertainty which may create serious problems in public transport.
The first intention of this initiative, as Mr Jarzembowski has said, is to promote public transport; we all agree that the European Union must promote high-quality public transport at the best possible price.
The Commission believes that many current contracts and agreements, which grant exclusive rights and financial compensation, may be questionable under the Treaty' s competition rules.
This is the risk we are dealing with and which this proposal is intended to resolve.
Secondly, while the problem of legal uncertainty is serious enough in itself, it is also clear that regulated competition in public transport must benefit both users and society in general.
The facts have demonstrated that systems open to competition controlled and regulated by the public sector have experienced a quicker increase in the number of passengers, during the 90s, than systems which have not been subject to any type of competitive pressure.
The reality is that we do not want private monopolies either.
You will understand that it would take hours to present the Commission' s position on each and every one of the 130 amendments which have been tabled on this subject.
I am therefore going to comment on the fundamental issues you have raised and, with regard to the specific amendment numbers, the services are at your disposal.
With regard to what we can accept, firstly we are in favour of the proposals intended to reinforce the quality criteria which the authorities must take into account on assessing transport needs and awarding contracts.
When the markets open up, the authorities must deal with all issues relating to employment, the environment and consumers, and possibly even more so if the services remain closed to competitive pressures.
We must therefore promote the opening up of the market in order to guarantee these levels and standards in terms of employment, the environment and consumers which we all want to see.
Secondly, the Commission can also accept a longer maximum duration for contracts.
The periods proposed in Amendments Nos 15 and 54 seem to us acceptable (8 years for buses and 15 years for railways).
Thirdly, with regard to the exceptions to the principle of competition, we can only accept those amendments which do not contradict our initial proposal, and not those which intend to further limit the scope of the regulation.
We can also accept those amendments which increase the de minimis thresholds applicable to direct awarding of contracts.
Having heard the debate, we accept that emergency situations may arise where it is impossible to organise competition on time and in a manner which allows the service to be maintained.
The amendments which deal with this issue are therefore acceptable in principle, although they may require some rewording.
We believe that they should be combined in a single emergency clause which also covers other similar circumstances.
The Commission could also accept those amendments which contribute to ensuring that the authorities responsible for compensation have greater flexibility with regard to the general rules laid down for all operators, such as those which establish maximum charges, and which, in some cases, must be applied as appropriate.
Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission can accept the idea of a transitional period which lasts eight years, as proposed in Amendment No 90.
However, instead of a 'big bang' on that date, we believe that the regulation should lay down a gradual opening up of the market by the authorities, with a first step after four years.
It is also acceptable that existing contracts, awarded in accordance with competition, may continue their natural course, provided that their duration is fixed (that is, that they are not indefinite contracts) and reasonable.
However, ladies and gentlemen, there are things which we cannot accept, because they would undermine the aim of the Commission' s proposal.
For example, we cannot support the exclusion of complete sectors from the scope of the regulation; we cannot accept Amendments Nos 23, 28 and 128, which would exclude all long-distance services.
It may be that Parliament is in favour of increasing competition in long-distance passenger rail transport, but I would prefer this issue to be dealt with under the second package of rail measures.
The draft report raises legal problems in certain cases.
Amendment No 24 would give priority to the regulation over the directives on public contracts.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission believes that this could lead to the European Union failing to comply with its commitments contained in the World Trade Organisation agreement on public contracts.
We cannot therefore accept this amendment either.
The second legal problem relates to reciprocity.
The permanent and structural reciprocity clauses are contrary to the non-discrimination requirements laid down in the Treaties.
We cannot therefore accept those amendments which simply propose structural reciprocity clauses.
However, we believe that, until certain exceptions are incorporated, it is necessary, in a transitional and exceptional fashion, to accept certain types of clause which limit access to a market.
It is important that transition towards controlled competition be accompanied by adequate safeguards, also in the field of social protection, an issue which some of you have mentioned.
We cannot therefore accept amendments which would leave the competent authorities without room for manoeuvre in this respect.
I have presented the Commission' s opinion on the majority of the most important issues dealt with in Mr Meijer' s report, but - I am sure you will have noticed - certain crucial issues still remain.
For example, the report includes a group of amendments (Amendments Nos 3, 12, 14, 61, 100, 126 and 129) which intend to safeguard the capacity of public operators to continue to exist without their ability to compete and provide services adequately and to the benefit of the citizens being questioned periodically, by means of public tenders.
In legal terms, there is no fundamental problem in relation to the principle that public authorities should decide to provide the transport service themselves.
The initiative states that.
The main legal problem arises when the public authority continues to deny all the other companies the opportunity to provide those services in the same area, in a situation of transparent and honest competition.
We are talking about a certain level of transport, not small-scale transport between two towns, which is excluded from the scope of this directive as a result of the de minimis stipulations, as is stated clearly.
We are talking about significant transport markets.
We cannot therefore accept those amendments as they are worded.
We do not believe that they benefit the citizens, because they go too far, isolating operators from market pressures to maintain and improve the situation.
However, we believe that the option of self-production laid down in those amendments could be maintained, with certain strict and clearly established conditions.
It is clear that this approach should be accompanied by provisions which guarantee that all operators preserve standards of quality and integration, and which ensure that the authorities remain capable of controlling competitions to the benefit of the users of the services.
The final part of Amendment No 112, which proposes the direct allocation of up to 10% of public services to a private sector operator, is also acceptable, provided that the authority cannot invoke this or other exceptions in simultaneous tendering for a single mode of transport.
Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, if Parliament votes for this report in its current form, I fear that the text, the spirit and the objective of the Commission' s proposal will be seriously affected.
In this respect, we would have to re-examine the real overall contribution of this modification to Community legislation.
The Commission still believes that we must modernise the current regulation (which has existed for several decades), that we must bring things up to date so that public transport may enjoy sufficient legal certainty to guarantee that it is of the highest quality, as competitive as possible, with the best prices and with the legal certainty which will allow public authorities to subsidise and economically support certain routes and certain requirements, such as those of pensioners and other groups, without having to argue this before the courts.
We need efficient public transport, at the service of the citizens, which contributes to rebalancing the transport systems and preventing a future situation of gridlock within the European transport system, which would damage our productive, economic and competitive capacity, job creation and above all the quality of life of our citizens.
Thank you, Commissioner De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Market access to port services
The next item on the agenda is the report (A5-0354/2001) by Mr Jarzembowski on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision [COM(2001) 35 - C5-0078/2001 - 2001/0047(COD)] on market access to port services.
Mr President, the Commission proposal for a decision on market access to port services should be considered and appreciated as part of the comprehensive Commission communication on improved quality of services in ports.
This communication was to draw conclusions from the positions of Parliament and of the Council on the Commission's 1997 Green Paper.
When we consider the past weeks, we must observe that, whilst the European Parliament was in 1999 still able to agree by a large majority on a position on the Green Paper, the present Commission proposal, which is only intended to regulate market access to services in individual ports, has aroused a great deal of controversy in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, as attested by the result of the vote on the report - 26 in favour, 21 against and 11 abstentions.
So I hope that today's debate and tomorrow's vote will produce a clear position from this House, something in which I intend to play my part.
For if we cannot work out a clear position at first reading stage, the Council then has the last word.
We do not want to trust the Council to that extent, but rather we want to pull our own weight.
In Committee, the majority supported the Commission's desire to adopt only regulations on competition in individual ports and include in this all service providers.
The report is, though, ambiguous on one point, that is, on whether pilot services should fall within the scope of the decision.
On the one hand, Amendment No 14 in the Committee's report states that pilot services are not to be affected by the provisions, but the application to delete pilot services from the appendix to the opinion, which alone defines the opinion's scope, was not accepted.
That being the case, we, as Parliament, must give a clear lead tomorrow.
Among the other amendments in the Committee's report, I would like in particular to highlight the fundamental extension of the scope of the proposal to include port access, be it by sea routes or canals, likewise a more restrictive definition of self-handling and the abandonment of the requirement for at least two service providers per category of cargo handling, likewise the requirement we have incorporated into the opinion, that, when tenders are invited, the new service provider should compensate its predecessor for the investments.
A minority in the Committee tried to highlight, above all, the Commission's failure to comply with Parliament's 1999 demand for conditions for fair competition between ports in the EU, and produce a proposal for a regulation to create them.
The Commission has produced neither a transparency study nor guidelines for the monitoring of aid.
A minority in the Committee therefore proposed the adoption of new regulations on transparency in financial relations between ports and State offices and also on permissible State aid measures for ports, the intention being to provide legal protection for ports and also to prevent excessive aid provision.
For me personally, this is very much about our need to agree tomorrow on this transparency issue, for the issue of transparency and fair conditions for competition between ports is crucial to the ports' ability to function.
All of us have repeatedly emphasised that ports play a central role in European transport policy, with 70% of foreign trade and 30% of trade within the Community passing through them.
They are significant junctions, and they must work well.
I believe that nobody need fear transparency, which leads to fair conditions for competition.
That characteristic and criterion is, I believe, a good basis for a real increase in the efficiency of ports.
In that spirit, I hope we will have a good discussion this afternoon and that this House will vote wisely tomorrow.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, all of us who have participated in the work of the committee know that this has been a difficult and controversial debate which has even, at times, caused tension in Parliament.
I would like to make several things clear: firstly, this is a good proposed directive by the Commission.
I repeat: I believe that it is a good proposal, and this has been reflected in the vote in committee.
I believe that it is a positive regulation and is very important if the European Union is to have efficient maritime and port services.
We must not forget that 80% of the European Union' s trade is carried out by sea.
And this liberalisation proposed by the Commission will no doubt benefit short sea shipping.
Furthermore, there is clearly a need for Community regulation of these services in accordance with the liberalising approach established at the Lisbon Council and which has already been applied in other sectors of services.
The proposal we are dealing with today includes technical-nautical services (pilotage and mooring) and cargo-handling services.
There are no reasons, on the grounds of safety, training or anything else, to justify their exclusion from the scope of the directive.
We must clearly take account of the particular nature of ports and the fact that there are services whose provision begins or ends outside the physical area of the port.
Another essential element of the system proposed by the Commission is the concept of self-handling, which is already laid down in Directive 96/67/EC on access to the groundhandling market at Community airports.
I would like to briefly mention certain other elements of the port package.
We are talking about public funding of ports and the need for great transparency in the financial relations between public authorities and ports and State aid.
I agree with certain amendments which try to describe this aspect.
But with regard to State aid, it seems clear that this directive is not the right place to discuss this issue.
Lastly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, although we have disagreed on certain points, for the enormous amount of work he has done and the huge effort he has made to try to reconcile all the proposals.
Mr President, ports, particularly seaports, are normally cosmopolitan systems and they are junctions in the TENs for traffic by ship and sea, which is in principle the most environmentally-friendly mode of transport.
The openness of seaports, though, bears no relation whatever to the system by which they are financed.
Far from it; I think opacity, very often intentional, is the right word to use for it.
To put it in nautical language: when it comes to financing seaports, the bulkheads are closed.
The present financial structures could be described as hazy and must be changed.
I believe that tomorrow's vote must be about transparency in financial relationships and in State finance, for that is the first requirement for fair competition between seaports.
Granted, that is not exactly easy.
Ports are under private, State, joint State and private, and public control, but all of them are enterprises in competition with each other, and so we need fair conditions.
Aid is unobjectionable, but it must be aid for all.
The problem is, I think, that competition between ports has to be organised.
In principle, it occurs within ports or should do so, if all the Community regulations are brought into play.
Pilot services are another issue.
We see them as a public duty, serving safety at sea and the safety of man and nature, and the Member States have essentially reasonable regulations on them.
I believe it would be possible to extend them in view of the recurrent accidents off the German Baltic coast.
One sometimes gets the impression that, when it comes to navigation, many ships use the Shell atlas and nothing else.
So, safety at sea with pilot services must not fall victim to the alleged pressure on costs exerted by competition.
I extend my warmest thanks to the rapporteur.
I know that he has had a difficult job, but his shadow does not always have an easy time of it either.
To start with, I agree with the previous speaker' s last sentence.
I do not need to repeat that ports are important.
In my view, the Commission proposal helps us to enhance the efficiency of ports.
Like a few of my fellow MEPs, however, I have noticed one shortcoming: there are no proposals on state aid and transparency.
It would be best, and I have tabled an amendment to that effect, if these new proposals were to come from the Commission and not from the text which we as Parliament are now drafting.
Commissioner, I should like to ask you if you would be able to tell us more about possible plans in that direction during this debate.
In any event, I hope that my fellow MEPs will support this amendment and that we will therefore ask the Commission to submit new proposals concerning those two points.
For the rest, I back the Commission proposal.
We must increase competition at ports.
This must also include maritime access, not only for technical-nautical services, but also for the handling of cargo and passengers.
We should therefore not dispose of the handling of cargo.
I think that pilotage can also be retained in the directive.
As you rightly stated, it forms a significant link in the life of most ports.
However, if we prescribe a few requirements, impose a number of conditions in the social field, and give due consideration to economic aspects, the environment and public services, as is the case in the directive and in my amendment, we will have more guarantees than if we simply fall back on the Treaty.
For I believe that that is the choice: either we include a special rule for ports in a directive, or we fall back on the Treaty and simply apply to pilotage the general rules of the Treaty which provide for the free movement of services.
I think it would be preferable to adopt the Commission proposal in this respect.
In any case, I am of the opinion that we as Parliament need to cooperate with the Commission constructively, possibly allow for a conciliation procedure with the Council, and ensure that we reinforce the operation of ports and competition in and among ports in a constructive manner to encourage the vital aspect of transport by water as much as possible.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Jarzembowski, thank you for all your work, but we have not reached our goal yet.
Particularly since the Green Paper actually asked for something else on behalf of Parliament and its handling than what we have now received, namely a consideration of the competition among ports instead of in ports.
Why?
If we look at the various coastlines in Europe, and I can think of a few, there are two, maybe six, seven or eight major ports located within a few hundred kilometres of each other, where competition is mainly generated from that small distance between the ports. Antwerp, Hamburg, Rotterdam, and so it goes on.
The same happens in the Mediterranean in the south.
However, this leads to distorted competition which does not really benefit us.
So that is the first problem.
It also leads to overcapacity and the funding of this overcapacity.
That too is a thorn in our side, and we should like to see common guidelines in this respect.
This, in turn, impacts on the environment, it results in an excessive use of space and generates all kinds of additional problems which we as Greens are also being faced with to a considerable extent.
In terms of competition among ports, we would therefore actually like to propose more transparency and that a reasonable amount of thought be given to state aid.
We would sooner call for coordination among ports, which we would like to add to the objectives of this study along with transparency, and not only the opening of competition in ports, which has been the subject of discussion thus far.
If we turn our attention to competition within ports, as is formulated here, we would particularly like to see the pilotage scrapped for safety and environmental reasons.
I believe that we can rely on majority backing for this.
We also believe it would be wise to delete the handling of cargo, since it does not in any way benefit competition.
Finally, following on from transparency, we call for autonomous research to be carried out. This research should be autonomous vis-à-vis, yet commissioned by, Parliament.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposal for a directive on market access to port services was not acceptable.
The removal of constrictions on free movement of services within the Community does not in fact mean only liberalisation and privatisation, but also European harmonisation with due regard being given to Member States' rights to provide public services in defence of the common interest.
It is noticeable that the rapporteur took account of data specific to ports and attempted to include in his report not only requirements for safety, environmental protection and social standards but also the economic needs of ports.
The vote in Committee is evidence of the fact that opinion was not divided on group lines but that there were differences of outlook specific to different countries.
Removal of pilot services, cargo handling and passenger services from the scope of the directive is something I can go along with, as is the retention of licences granted to previous service providers and the setting of minimum standards for new ones.
The Commission's draft has also undergone radical amendment with regard to financial settlement for investments made and the transparency of the financial relationship between ports and State authorities.
Briefly, Mr Jarzembowski's report changes the Commission's document in the right direction.
As, though, I thoroughly share the view of many of my fellow Members, namely that port services should generally be left to the Member States, I intend to abstain in the vote.
Mr President, this report has had a rather odd journey.
Whereas initially, it was a very logical report which, in my view, contained a reasonably correct interpretation of the facts, we now have before us an incoherent document which spawns many comments.
I shall confine myself to the key points.
Firstly, the alleged state aid of Member States for their ports forms the root of the problem.
If government funding for ports does not become transparent, other measures can hardly take effect.
Closer examination of this funding should therefore be given the highest priority, followed by a clear, financial framework which distinguishes legal from illegal support.
Secondly, the inclusion of cargo handling in the proposal prejudices the port authorities' sovereignty to pursue their own strategic policy.
It is reported to lead to the breach of existing, long-term contracts, which will have far-reaching financial implications for the relevant services.
Furthermore, the maintenance of existing contracts renders the present legislation superfluous.
When these contracts lapse, it is likely that economic insights will have changed yet again.
Thirdly, I am of the opinion that pilotage can also remain excluded from this legislation.
I would draw your attention to an amendment which aims to secure surety from governments to render the use of technical-nautical services, in particular, mandatory.
Without surety, considerable problems can arise in the smaller ports.
That cannot be the intention, if I have understood everyone correctly.
Let it be clear: without a number of essential changes, we will be unable to vote in favour of the present report.
Thank you.
Mr President, Mr Vice-President, first I think we should all congratulate Mr Jarzembowski on his excellent work, the time he spent on it and, of course, his patience, because this is an exceptionally tricky issue.
We should also congratulate Commissioner de Palacio on the substance of the proposal which she submitted to us and which is based on the liberalisation of port services, which she wishes to push on with.
Not as an end in itself, but as a means of bringing about better, cheaper services and improving the competitiveness of the European economy.
And, of course, when we speak of competitiveness and liberalisation and apply them to telecommunications, energy, the railways, we cannot leave out port services.
This too is another brick in the wall of the single market.
There can be no doubt that ports are a rule unto themselves, as is every sector.
Obviously we need to look at the question of aid and how it can be reconciled with the rules of transparency.
We need to look at the specific problem of pilotage, which several Members have already mentioned, and see how pilotage relates to safety.
Consequently, we need to look at a whole host of other issues.
But this should not lead us into ignoring the material facts and the material facts are that liberalising port services will have a beneficial effect on competitiveness and our objective of providing better, cheaper services to those who use them.
So the message which we need to send out from this debate is clear: a dual message of liberalisation and transparency.
Of course there are groups which will be affected by these proposals. Of course there are interests which do not like these proposals.
But the greater good is the objective of competitiveness, and the growth and jobs which it creates.
And I believe that the philosophy behind the proposal before us serves precisely this objective.
Mr President, Commissioner, this is one of the rare occasions when politics must swallow its pride and take into account geographical requirements.
Chairman Hatzidakis is right: we must have the courage to say 'no' to those pressure groups which sometimes attempt to prevent the Commission and the institutions from tackling areas affecting them which Europe has never clearly addressed.
I therefore feel this proposal for a directive is appropriate in order to regulate and improve access to the port market and services.
The calls for safety, the protection of workers, quality of service and, of course, respect for the environment, are appropriate and vital.
I would like to make two points on this subject: we, like the Commission, believe that it is right and proper to include in the scope of this directive terminal cargo handling services, in particular, that is those services which represent over 90% of the volume of business of ports.
In addition, we feel that, if an exception is to be laid down to the application of this directive on grounds of safety or environmental protection, it would thus make no sense to limit it just to pilots and exclude the other technical-nautical services.
Lastly, we do not feel that this directive is the most appropriate instrument to address the issue of the public financing system.
There are too many discrepancies between the systems of the 15 countries of the European Union and some extremely grey areas continue to remain.
Consider - and we must be quite honest about this - how, in some of the major ports of northern Europe, there is proof of commitment to State financing in the fact that representatives of public authorities sit on the managing bodies of the individual ports.
This must be made clear in the name of the transparency rightly advocated by Mr Jarzembowski.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree that this proposal is very significant for port services insofar as it affects one of the most important transport infrastructures of the European maritime regions and because of the process of liberalisation of access to the market in these services.
I would like to make several points:
Firstly, the philosophy of liberalisation must include making the process more flexible so that it does not lead to dangerous or inappropriate radicalism.
Secondly, we must take account of the geographical reality of the seaports in the various regions of the European Union.
Thirdly, the jobs of the port workers affected must be guaranteed, as well as their social protection.
And on transposing this directive in the various Member States, the principle of subsidiarity must be taken into account.
These are the reasons that have allowed me to support this directive with certain clarifications, and justify certain particular amendments, which are coherent amongst themselves, and which deal with the fact that certain regions of the Member States affected are of an insular or peripheral nature, where the port is paramount and, in many cases, quality services are already provided.
Despite everything, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski.
Mr President, the aim of the directive proposed by the Commission is indeed to open up all port services to competition.
In my opinion, these proposals will address the living and working conditions of port staff but I do not feel that they will improve them.
We are told that improvements are taking place, but, as is all too often the case, there has been no prior study of the effects of this liberalisation, in particular with regard to such important issues as safety, the environment and employment.
Those affected have not been consulted, in particular, trade unions (we can always call them 'lobbies' if you prefer), even though they know the safety needs of people and the environment, and have unrivalled knowledge.
Although the amendments made to Mr Jarzembowski' s report take into consideration certain problems that I have just raised, in my opinion they are far from adequate.
They do nothing to temper the line taken by the text as a whole.
Self-handling in the ports would therefore equate to allowing social dumping.
Given the current practices of commercial fleets, this measure will lead to inadequate safety levels and the deterioration of environmental safety, employment and working conditions.
I will support the amendments that seek to exclude dockers from the directive.
These staff carry out an important economic task under difficult conditions, while still ensuring safety.
Nautical services for piloting and mooring are universally recognised as services of general interest.
They should, in my opinion, be considered as partners in their own right, with a view to sustainable development.
Well then, the proposals of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, do take account of pilots but not of mooring service providers, which I personally regret.
I believe that the European Union should work towards harmonisation at the top end of working and employment conditions for employees in this sector, which is the only way to genuinely guarantee economic and social effectiveness while respecting the environment.
The proposals made to date will not, in my opinion, take us any further towards these essential objectives.
Mr President, in my constituency lie the ports of Felixstowe and Harwich, the largest privately owned port complex in Europe and a model of commercial success.
The owners tell me that this directive has been prepared without thorough consultation and that, if passed, it will be seriously damaging to the whole UK port industry.
They say that it would force many ports to restructure, yet would do nothing to improve efficiency in a cargo handling market characterised by competition between ports, not within ports.
Thus, if there are problems of restrictive practices in cargo handling and pilotage in some continental ports, they should be tackled by individual Member States.
As is so often the case, one size does not fit all.
I urge the Commission, even at this late stage, to rethink this damaging proposal.
Competition is one thing.
Destruction of a successful industry is quite another.
I ask you to take this directive back and consult properly with those who are affected by it.
Mr President, it is a real pity that the Commission completely ignored Parliament's position on the 1997 Green Paper which stated: "No need for Community legislation on organisational structure and market access for port services".
That was our position then and I hope it is going to be our position tomorrow, but so far the Commissioner has failed to explain why she has ignored that.
Secondly, so far the Commission has ignored the question of why there has been no regulatory impact assessment on this proposal.
Whether you are for it or against it, it is extraordinary that such a proposal as this is not subject to the assessment that President Prodi assured the House would apply to all new Commission proposals.
Why is Mr Prodi not honouring commitments given to this House?
Thirdly and finally, why is this proposal so over-prescriptive?
Why is it going to burden a successful industry with more red tape, with no justification whatsoever?
Why does it seek to regulate in minute detail every aspect of a port's operation?
Why, for example, does it call for cargo handling to be provided by at least two service providers for each type of cargo?
How can that make any sense when you are trying to organise the arrangements at ports?
Bearing all that in mind and unwelcome as the proposal is, it is even more extraordinary that it does not address the issue of state aids or transparency of accounts.
The whole package is unbalanced and unworkable.
I hope the House rejects it tomorrow.
Mr President, I come from Sweden where we have quite a high degree of exposure to competition and privatisation of various services.
The lesson to be drawn from our experience is that the crucial issue is not really market competition or privatisation, as such, but quality, greater efficiency and good, cleverly designed organisation.
These are aspects to which the Commission has given insufficient consideration in its proposal.
I want to express my thanks to Mr Jarzembowski who, as rapporteur, has come up with many criticisms of the Commission' s proposal.
I should like to make a number of important exceptions, and I shall point out a couple of these.
Quite a few speakers have referred to pilotage. I believe that pilotage is quite clearly a service for the benefit of everyone.
Pilotage must not therefore be regarded in terms of the same economic criteria as ordinary production, but from a safety perspective.
Taking responsibility oneself can have very serious consequences when it comes to loading and unloading. That especially applies in view of the fact that flags of convenience are a common phenomenon.
I am in favour of transparency and public scrutiny where ports are concerned.
I am in favour of self-financed ports.
I want to see quality and efficiency brought about through ports' preparing their own development programmes instead of being subjected to extensive forms of control from Brussels. Such programmes must be carried out in cooperation with staff and clients at the ports.
Mr President, over the next few years the present directive will determine the operation of our ports, which will play an ever more important role in trade traffic on account of ever increasing traffic flows among other things.
Unlike in the past, modern port users are uncommitted: they choose their port on the basis of price and quality.
There are important financial channels that run from authorities to port companies.
A need for more insight into the investment flows has arisen.
In addition, a level playing field is needed for all interested parties.
This situation could be improved by setting up a number of basic rules.
I should like to highlight a few aspects in this context.
First of all, there is the scope of the directive.
It does not simply cover the port itself, but mainly the port users.
Deleting cargo handling from the directive will not benefit the quality of the service which ports offer their customers.
Freight services, or cargo handling, should simply remain in the directive.
Secondly, ship services, also referred to as pilotage and towage services.
Amendments Nos 3, 14 and 51 aim to keep pilotage outside the scope of the directive, based on the outmoded notion that pilotage services are always public services.
I will not support these amendments.
In my country, pilotage services have not been a public service for a very long time, and that has worked out very well.
A directive which regulates market access to port services therefore covers both ship and port services.
Needless to say, we must move towards more transparency of the financial flows with regard to infrastructure, but I should like to leave the powers where they are, and will therefore vote in favour of Mr Sterckx' Amendment No 47 in which the Commission is still being requested to submit proposals in this field.
What matters is that ports facilitate reshipment and receiving companies.
Ports and their users deserve solid, well-thought-out legislation.
I regret that the way in which this directive has been dealt with in Parliament has created unnecessary tension between northern, southern and western Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, it was very difficult to assess this text as its focus has shifted slightly.
We were supposed to address the issue of competition in ports and we are now being presented with a text on competition between ports.
I do not know what will happen tomorrow, but I am sure there will be some confusion.
In passing, I regret that the mooring service providers' lot is not the same as the pilots' .
I do not see why we would maintain competition for mooring service providers while excluding pilots. These professions are fairly similar.
With regard to competition between ports, I feel that transparency is a good thing, but I would warn you against going straight from that to decreeing competition between ports without closer analysis, for ports are first and foremost tools for regional development.
They do not have the same nautical qualities.
Moreover, if we were to increase competition, your entire sustainable mobility policy would fall through.
I actually think that, in years to come, we will have to help the southern ports and the ports on the Atlantic coast take over from the over concentrated mass of North Sea ports.
Otherwise, we will be going against both the Erika-Maritime Safety package and our desire to remove lorries from the major transit countries.
In my opinion, the Commission will actually have to present us with specific proposals on State aid to ports focusing on regional development rather than just competition between products.
Mr President, as other Members have already said, the full complexity and problematic nature of the work over which Mr Jarzembowski has presided, competently and doggedly, must be recognised, and we all hope that the final result will be positive in terms of providing the necessary safeguards for the different principles.
We support the Commission' s proposal, particularly insofar as some of the amendments tabled by Parliament have helped to make opening up the port services market a viable possibility, and, although this does not in itself appear to be the most remarkable result, it is positive in terms of revamping services and of introducing elements of competition, provided, as some of the amendments advocate, that certain social clauses remain untouched, that certain requirements relating to environmental safety, professional standards and continuity of authorisations continue to be met.
Parliament' s vote will make it possible to consolidate all this provided that, as far as the internal port services to be opened up to competition are concerned, there are no obscure exemption clauses which would render the scope of the directive meaningless.
That applies to cargo handling and terminal services, and we feel that, in due respect not least for the principle of subsidiarity, certain services in which safety and professionalism are of paramount importance, such as pilotage, could be revitalised.
Finally, subjects which do not fall within the scope of the directive must not be allowed to infiltrate it.
The Commission will certainly have the opportunity to present a proposal on public financing for ports, and we look forward to it, but we must not now make the mistake of anticipating the proposal and bringing forward its introduction without a legal basis, creating unacceptable areas of discrimination between the port systems of the Member States, which differ too widely in this respect.
Mr President, Mr Jarzembowski has undertaken a very difficult task, but he has carried out a major, carefully considered piece of work affecting crucial areas.
Ports are clearly a very important factor when we discuss fulfilment of the Kyoto commitments in as much as they can ease the pressure on land transport and make things easier in a wide range of other areas.
It is therefore essential from an environmental point of view to have some of the goods at present conveyed by land transported instead by sea.
If this is to happen successfully, ports must be efficient, and we must therefore see liberalisation within those areas proposed by the Commission: loading and unloading, passenger services and whatever else has been mentioned, presumably with some exemptions in special regions. Perhaps outlying districts, in particular, can ask to be accorded special consideration.
However, that too has, of course, been mentioned in the report.
I hope that, in the light of the many views presented in this House, we shall now be able to agree upon a proposal so that together we are able to support the Commission' s overall goal for the benefit of the whole of the EU.
Mr President, Commissioner, as you know, I come from a small port, but nonetheless one with European credentials as regards the trans-European networks.
I will quite happily note in our logbook that it is not about seeing things in black and white when liberalising and creating free and fair competition, simply in order to adhere to a principle.
The unedifying dispute about duty free is still in my mind.
This discussion about ports is also about jobs, attractive business propositions and public profile, and I want to take part in it, we need to define transparency rules for the calculation of costs and the use of public funds by ports, in order to establish fair competition within ports and between them.
Only transparency about the flow of public funds and services will make it possible to compare the services offered by the various seaports and in that way demonstrate which works more efficiently.
Comparability of services creates competition, and transparency is, in consequence, indispensable if we want to have long-term liberalisation of the market in port services.
I will say in addition that, at this time, we should not yet liberalise the pilot services.
Pilots have, as at present organised, long maintained a high standard of quality and safety on sea routes.
These extraordinarily high standards would be needlessly jeopardised by liberalisation at any cost.
Every market structure contains components for which quality rather than competition must come first.
Of course, the pilots will one day have to adopt a new approach - one day.
Even they will not be able to resist the opening-up of the market forever, but as far as safety at sea is concerned, there are at present more pressing matters such as, for, example, the introduction of a 'black box' for ships.
Immediately forcing pilots to be subject to competition would, under certain circumstances, lead to a price war that could compromise the safety of shipping lanes in the long term.
Mr President, while the European economy is having a coughing fit we must decide whether to say a final good-bye to 'Eurosclerosis' and protectionism, whether to allow port monopolies to remain as they are or whether we should give free rein to the dynamics of economy.
Sabena is a warning example of the kind of inefficiency that centrally managed industrial policies can produce in the worst possible case.
Should we exclude cargo handling from the directive on ports, all that would be left of it would be an empty shell.
This is why Amendment 52 is dangerous.
Although I am in favour of the inclusion of all major ports, I can, nevertheless, give my support to Amendment 79 proposed by Mr Atkins.
This amendment would restrict the directive to covering public ports only.
My British colleagues could then accept the inclusion of cargo handling without any concern.
We must not forget that British exporters benefit from reasonably priced port services in continental Europe.
The numbers of port operators should not be restricted except for compelling reasons.
Should economic efficiency be accepted as a criterion for restricting the numbers, this would leave a great deal of room for speculation as to when operations are efficient and when they are not.
This is a reason why Amendments 6, 25 and 44 should not be seconded.
On the other hand, Amendment 50 on the definition of the port system is not acceptable because, according to the amendment, a port in Greece and a port in Germany, for example, could be construed as forming a single port.
I am sorry but this is an absurd idea.
As regards pilotage, we, the members of the committee, concluded that strict national rules should apply.
Therefore, safety aspects cannot be used as an excuse for a monopoly.
Is it our intention then to prevent the development of EU ports by diluting the directive that has been awaited for so long?
Cargo handling and pilotage, based on national rules, should be included, absolutely.
Also, the port system should be defined in a concise manner.
My highly honourable colleague Jarzembowski' s ideas on this matter are, unfortunately, a long way away from the actual needs of port users.
We cannot change Europe into a giant Hamburg.
The committee has reached a good compromise and we should clearly stick to that.
'Eurosclerosis' hits the poor hardest.
Now we have a good opportunity to do a favour to European employment and sustainable development.
Let us pilot Europe towards competitive ports.
Mr President, as a former member of the Amsterdam City Council Port Committee and as a current inhabitant of Rotterdam, I know what is wrong with competition, expansion and labour relations in ports.
The ports along the coast between Hamburg and Le Havre, spanning Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France, largely service the same hinterland.
They have traditionally competed with each other with low tariffs and large public investments to secure the highest possible cargo levels for their quays.
This competition involves taxpayers' money, and there is unnecessary secrecy about the use of taxpayers' money.
An orderly and scheduled distribution of tasks among those ports saves public funding and better provides the port workers with sustainable employment without the unnecessary peaks and troughs.
That is why I support the remarkable agreement between a large contingent to the Left and rapporteur Jarzembowski, which reminds us of the position which this Parliament has adopted once before, namely the position that transparent competition among ports is far more useful than organising competition in the ports.
Competing pilotage and towage services are at the expense of safety, working conditions and job security.
That is why we need to avoid the wrong interventionist measures from the powers that be.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank Mr Jarzembowski for all the work he has done as rapporteur throughout this debate. It has clearly been difficult work, and we must all be aware of what is at stake here.
I would therefore ask Parliament as a whole to try to give the rapporteur the greatest support possible, with certain slight modifications to what Mr Jarzembowski proposes, since, for once, I do not agree with some of his suggestions.
I would like to remind you that 70% of trade with third countries depends on the efficiency of our ports.
It is clear that sea ports play an essential role in relation to the European Union' s trade.
But furthermore, if we want to deal with the future of transport within the European Union in a credible fashion, not trade between the European Union and third countries, where we will continue to depend largely on sea transport, but within the European Union, we must move on from words and declarations to actions, once and for all, and make short sea shipping a reality. This requires our ports to be as competitive, as efficient and as well-interconnected with adjacent territories as possible.
As you know, to this end, a few months ago, ports were incorporated into the trans-European networks for the first time, precisely so that they may be fully integrated into the Union' s internal transport system and thereby play a crucial role in making that system sustainable and competitive.
The Commission' s proposal is part of a package which deals with various issues of port policy: the transparency of flows of public funds destined for ports; criteria for what is State aid and what is not.
It deals with aspects relating to competition between ports.
The proposed directive which you must vote on deals with the issue of competition between service providers within ports, covering all the services that are normally provided to port users and are of commercial value.
In a moment I will mention something which several of you have referred to; competition between ports.
However, now we are going to talk about the proposed directive relating to competition within ports.
The proposal is based on two pillars: one relating to content and the other to procedures.
With regard to content, we propose bringing ourselves into line with the legislation passed by Parliament and the Council in similar areas, where rules have been established to open up the markets.
I am talking about telecommunications, gas, electricity, but especially, in the transport sector, ground services at airports.
Although the Treaty does not in principle allow restrictions to market access, the ports have their own specific characteristics such as possible space limitations and the fundamental importance of safety and environmental issues.
Our proposal guarantees a fair balance between these needs.
I am pleased to note that, in its vote, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism expressed its satisfaction with this approach.
We must allow self-handling in ports where operators consider that they can obtain better performance from their own personnel and equipment and we must guarantee that, as in the case of all the other sectors, the number of service providers can only be restricted for justifiable reasons, such as space limitations, or the safety of sea traffic in this case.
All competent service providers must have equal opportunities to operate in the ports of their choice.
This brings me to the second pillar of our proposal: procedures.
The procedural rules must be transparent, non-discriminatory, objective and proportionate.
This is not always the case at the moment.
I am convinced that what was possible for ground services at airports must also be possible for ports.
And I believe that, although it is going to create certain problems, as is always the case when there is a change to a situation that has remained the same for a long time, perhaps even for centuries, it is certain that this change will be of benefit to the whole system, to the economy and to the quality of life of the citizens of the European Union in general.
Of course, specific local characteristics must be taken into account, above all on issues relating to safety, the environment and social aspects.
Our proposal will therefore allow for a high level of flexibility on a national, regional and, above all, local level, so that ports can manage their own affairs in an open and balanced fashion.
Focussing now on the amendments, I would like to say that, having examined them in detail, the Commission can accept most of them.
Many amendments improve our proposal substantially with regard to the clarification of the definitions of port services and self-handling and they include compensation rules which are not only implicit, but also explicit, as is the case with Amendments Nos 18, 20, 32 and, in part, Amendment No 46, which we fully accept.
I would also like to mention Amendment No 15, which allows Member States to extend the scope of the directive to inland waterways close to ports.
Furthermore, we accept part of Amendments Nos 25 and 44 which limit, for reasons of maritime safety, the number of service providers rather than that of just providers of technical-nautical services.
It is a reasonable measure and it is in accordance with the Commission' s general interests in the field of maritime safety.
We also agree with the idea that the time period finally approved in relation to the maximum periods of authorisation should facilitate normal repayment and performance of investments, and we therefore accept an extension of the time limit and also, possibly, compensation where total repayment has not taken place, as certain other amendments suggest.
There are other amendments that, although they do not introduce changes, provide useful clarifications, particularly in relation to the continued application of the rules currently in force with regard to safety, the environment and social issues.
All of these amendments can be accepted, though with modifications to their wording.
However, there are issues that we cannot accept, for various different reasons, and you must understand this, ladies and gentlemen.
In the case of certain amendments to the recitals of the directive, they do not really correspond to the legislative text itself, for example: Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 12. Neither can the Commission accept amendments that substantially change or reduce the scope of the directive.
Having reached this point, please allow me to point out two problems which have been at the centre of the debates in Parliament' s Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism: should ground services be included in the scope of the directive?
The enormous majority of parties accept that this inclusion is necessary, and we could not accept any amendment, such as No 52, which leads to the exclusion of this sector.
If we want modern, high-quality ports, that which is possible and necessary for ground services in airports must also be possible and necessary in ports.
Furthermore, this position received majority support in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
The same is true with the amendments aimed at excluding self-handling and the right of service providers to employ the personnel of their choice, such as Amendments Nos 69, 70, 71, 72 and 73, which are also rejected.
The latter is already included in the legislation.
However, if you read our proposal correctly, you will see that service providers cannot employ so-called 'pirate workers' .
It is not possible.
If these misunderstandings can be overcome by clarifying our text, the Commission is prepared to seek an appropriate wording.
Another problem is the issue of pilotage.
The question is once again whether pilotage can be included in the directive or not.
Many people believe that certain safety considerations make it difficult to include this particular sector, but there are ways to ensure safety which are different from those which are currently applied.
The same is true for other technical-nautical services, which is why the Commission cannot accept those amendments which exclude pilotage from the scope of the directive.
In this regard also, Parliament' s relevant committee supported our proposal.
Certain other amendments are also unacceptable for various reasons: specifically, economic considerations concerning the service provider should not be a criterion, as is mentioned in the second part of Amendment No 25.
Service providers must accept commercial risks and public authorities must not carry out economic assessments.
Having said this, our proposal leaves a door open: when exceptional circumstances arise relating to the volume of cargo, the number of service providers may be restricted.
Furthermore, without going into detail, we cannot accept various amendments for technical reasons and the list is available to you.
Lastly, I would like to refer to Amendment No 26.
Our proposal indicates that normally, and I repeat, normally, at least two service providers will have to be authorised for each category of cargo.
If we were to remove this article, we would have to apply the rule established in another paragraph, which would authorise the greatest possible number of service providers, a consequence which I do not believe was intended on presenting this amendment.
Certain amendments express the desire to put more stress on competition between ports than the Commission' s package on ports does.
Please allow me to deal with this issue by saying that I agree with the need to consider competition between ports as well, but I think that we need to find a more appropriate way of doing so.
For example, the increase in transparency: Amendments Nos 9 and 48. The Commission accepts this principle and I am counting on your support so that we can jointly find the best way to apply this principle.
Another example is the State aid mentioned in Amendment No 49.
We all agree that this State aid should not exist, but we must first provide a clear definition of the dividing line between what is State aid and what is not.
The Treaty lays down that the Commission and only the Commission applies the Treaty' s rules in the field of State aid.
The current legislative process will focus on this issue and I hope that we can sit down together to find a viable solution, within the framework of the Treaty, which clarifies such a thorny issue.
And if it is necessary to go further - and I have the impression from what you have said, and I share many of your concerns, that this is the case - I must say that I am prepared to go further than the provisions of the current proposal in the fields of State aid to ports and competition between ports.
Lastly, a few words on Amendment No 79, which proposes excluding private ports, many of which do not apply access restrictions.
During the legislative process, we will have to study ways of suitably dealing with this issue.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the legislative process.
During this long process, the Commission will be open to finding constructive solutions with the European Parliament which will allow us to be able to count upon the broadest possible support for this proposal, which is aimed at ensuring that a mature industry, an industry which has much to gain from the restructuring of the European transport industry, can meet the challenges before us and make a crucial contribution to our creating a sustainable transport system at the service of economic development, the creation of jobs, respect for the environment and the quality of life of our citizens.
Enlargement
The next item is the Commission communication on enlargement.
The President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, now has the floor.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, enlargement has been a top priority for this Commission from the very beginning of its mandate.
From the point of view of Europe' s powers and responsibilities, its potential and goals, enlargement is the real acid test. It is also Europe' s historic duty.
Enlargement - the unification of this continent - brings to a close a chapter in Europe' s history and lays the foundations for the future.
Through this process, the Union is preparing to shoulder responsibilities as a continent and we therefore need to take a closer look at our resources, policies and goals, at global level.
Our commitment and courage must match the commitment and courage which the candidate countries are showing as they prepare to join the Union.
Since the beginning of my mandate as President of the Commission, nothing has made a deeper impression on me than my trips to the candidate countries, my meetings with their citizens and the representatives of their governments, or my contact with their parliaments, bravely working day and night on the arduous task of bringing their societies safely through the transition consisting mainly of preparations for enlargement.
In recognition of their efforts, I would like to send them a message of thanks and good wishes from the European Parliament here in Strasbourg.
There you are: these are countries which, barely ten years ago, were literally cut off from the Europe in which we live. Since then, they have been restoring contact with our shared values.
Even before being formally admitted as new Member States, the candidate countries are starting to reap the benefits of their integration. In practice, they are already part of our area of stability and development, as is shown by the ever-increasing presence in the candidate countries of companies from the Member States.
We have already seen extraordinary progress along the road to accession.
The reports we are presenting to you today analyse as precisely as possible the countries' preparation efforts.
Here, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Commissioner Verheugen and his colleagues for their huge, unprecedented efforts, in terms of both quality and quantity, in instigating and experimenting with a truly remarkable methodology, and if we should prove to have failed at any time, it is because we really were stepping out in the dark.
In short, our reports show that this historic moment really is possible and just around the corner, but only if we are able to keep up this sustained pace.
Without going into the details of the reports, which Commissioner Verheugen will be describing in a few moments, I can tell you that progress has been made in virtually all the chapters making up the accession process.
I think I can safely say that this remarkable progress has been greatly inspired by Nice, where, a year ago, we set out the practical stages and the 'roadmap' , as we termed it, for the final stage of this path to enlargement.
One year from now, we will evaluate, together with Parliament, the ability of each of the candidate countries to assume the rights and responsibilities which are part and parcel of its integration into the Union.
We realise that, when that time comes, we will have to have concluded, or, at least, very nearly concluded the negotiations with the countries which have met the criteria laid down.
Once the conditions set by Parliament and the European Council have been complied with, and once the necessary ratification procedures are complete, these countries will be in a position to join the European Union before the June 2004 elections and thus elect representatives to this House for the next Parliamentary term.
Therefore, next year will be decisive for the enlargement process and for the future of Europe.
Negotiations will be tackling sensitive issues like agriculture, the Structural Funds and the budget and, in these negotiations, we will show the same determination to find constructive answers that we have shown in the past.
From the beginning of the year onwards, the Commission will be putting forward proposals based on the current acquis and on the principles adopted at the Berlin European Council.
Much will depend on the continued efforts of the candidate countries to adopt and implement the acquis.
As the Commission stresses in its Regular Reports this year, the candidate countries will also need to develop the necessary administrative capacity to be able to apply the Union' s rules and policies properly.
However, sustained efforts on behalf of the candidate countries are only one side of the coin.
In order for enlargement to be a success, it will be important to strengthen the Community method and sustain the necessary cooperation between the Council, Parliament and the Commission.
2002 will be a year of intense reviewing and monitoring and I know I can count on Parliament to scrutinise this work closely.
I would also urge the Member States to continue to respect their existing commitments regarding enlargement, particularly those contained in Agenda 2000 and the Financial Perspective for up to 2006, as agreed by the Berlin European Council in 1999.
We cannot make further reforms a pre-condition for enlargement, although the responsibilities which we are taking on with enlargement must prompt us to begin preparing, with considerable momentum and political vision, the new institutional process due to be launched at the Laeken European Council.
Similarly, the current negotiations should not be linked to the issue of the Union' s finances after 2006, these are separate issues.
Any attempt to relate them would mean changing the rules and would inevitably ultimately disrupt our carefully balanced negotiation process.
The reports we are presenting to you also look at the implications of enlargement for the candidate countries' neighbours, that is other European countries, and for the Mediterranean.
The terrorist attacks of 11 September against the US have completely changed the international situation. It is now less stable, less predictable and more frightening.
Now, more than ever, the world needs a strong Europe which is sure of its values, which sows stability, predictability, security and prosperity around it, and which is, at last, a leading power on the international stage.
With enlargement, Europe' s position as the world' s leading economy and trading power, with an internal market of 500 million consumers, will be confirmed.
With this situation established, we will be in a position to extend the area of stability and prosperity which we so need beyond the Union and the candidate countries.
If we are to achieve this, we will need a new 'neighbourhood policy' , and this is one of this Commission' s strategic goals.
As I have long maintained, and as I confirmed yesterday at the College of Europe in Bruges, we need to move beyond and expand the range of instruments available to the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, the partnerships with Russia and Ukraine, and our stability efforts in the Balkans.
The fundamental intention is to extend liberalisation of trade, the technical standards and the laws governing our internal market to all our neighbours.
The form that the appropriate agreements should take - free-trade agreements or agreements modelled on the European Economic Area agreement - will have to be determined through negotiations, but the essential objective will be to consolidate mutual economic presence.
Our central aim is to build a partnership with our neighbours that is as close as possible and which can become an anchor for stability and security.
Basically, what we need to do is 'export' stability, and lay the foundations for balanced development in all areas bordering on the Union, drawing on the main strengths of European integration.
This will make integration of our closest neighbours, the countries of the Western Balkans, easier when the time comes.
In our efforts, we must not, of course, neglect the importance of the cultural dimension of our partnership.
This is why we are working on a new initiative to encourage dialogue and mutual understanding between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean.
I am grateful for Parliament' s past and present support and constructive attitude towards the enlargement process. I am counting on Parliament' s continued support during this sensitive, final phase of the negotiations.
The work of the Members of this House will be crucial, not just in terms of ratification as such, but also, more generally, in terms of encouraging support for enlargement among Europe' s citizens.
Opinion polls indicate that, in many parts of the Union, many citizens still need to be convinced of the overall benefits of enlargement.
The Commission will, of course, continue and intensify its information strategy, but it is Parliament and its Members that can make the greatest, most effective contribution to building up the necessary democratic support for enlargement.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the continuous involvement of this House in the enlargement process remains crucial, and not least in terms of the debate on Europe' s future, a debate to which the candidate countries and future Member States are expected to make a substantial contribution.
The report presented by the Commission today shows that the beginning of a new European era is just a few steps away.
Let us take these steps together and continue and intensify our cooperation in the months to come, and thus lay the foundations for a larger, stronger, completely democratic Union.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will add to what President Prodi has already said by informing you of a number of things.
The Commission's essential political message for today is that the desire of Parliament and of the Council to achieve the first accessions before the 2004 European elections may well be ambitious, but it is realistic and feasible.
Why is this so?
Firstly, because the candidate countries continue to meet the political criteria, with the exception of Turkey with which we cannot, for this reason, begin negotiations this year.
Among the political criteria there are areas which still require our attention: good governance in the broadest sense of the word, international criminality, the functioning of the constitutional state - but I must repeat that the criteria have been met.
The progress made in fulfilling the economic criteria means that ten of the candidate countries are functioning market economies and are also either now, or will be in the near future, in a position to cope with the competitive pressure in the internal market.
These are all countries with which we have opened negotiations, with the exception of Bulgaria and Romania, where though, I must openly say, there has also been significant progress.
Particularly in Romania's case, the Commission considers it important to note that, for the first time, there is real progress in terms of political, economic and social reform, something which will be shown clearly only in the next progress report.
As regards the adoption of the acquis, this is reflected, above all, in the progress made in the negotiations, of which you are all well aware.
So far, we have achieved all that was envisaged in the framework of the negotiating timetable, and therefore the negotiating timetable fixed at Nice will continue to be the keynote of our actions.
What is actually new about this year's report is that we are now concentrating very intently on the last remaining, and very substantial, problem, namely how to ensure that the future Member countries, at the time of accession, will have the administrative capacity to meet all the obligations of a Member of the European Union.
For the avoidance of doubt, let me say that as yet they do not.
Not one of the candidate countries at present fully meets all three criteria.
The Commission therefore proposes the realisation of a special action plan to improve the candidate countries' implementation capacity.
We are therefore also making extensive additional resources available.
We will inform Parliament and the Council of the outcome as early as the middle of next year.
I do not want there to be any misapprehensions here.
If the progress reports focus heavily on the shortfalls that we still have today, this is simply because we cannot repeat every year what has already been done, but the nearer we come to the objective of the negotiations, all the more clearly do we see the problems that still remain.
In order to have the full picture, though, we must see the remaining problems against the background of the enormous progress that has been made over the past few years.
Only then do we get things in the right perspective.
We believe that it is possible to reduce the existing administrative and legal shortcomings in due time for the candidate countries to have adequate implementation capacity when they accede.
To put it very plainly: the Commission will no doubt have to give final opinions next year, and by that point there must be no more deficits.
Let me say in addition, that the accession negotiations with Cyprus are well advanced.
It is our strategic goal to take in a united Cyprus as a new member.
This requires constructive and substantial progress towards a lasting peace solution.
I therefore reiterate my appeal to all concerned to make use of the 'window of opportunity' to achieve this goal.
The pre-accession strategy for Turkey is showing the first positive results.
The constitutional reform recently adopted by the Turkish Parliament is a step in the right direction, but further reforms are necessary, especially in regard to effective protection of human rights and the implementation of economic reforms.
The Commission considers that it is now time to intensify the pre-accession strategy.
A more detailed scrutiny of Turkish legislation and its approximation to the acquis will be in the forefront.
We have, though, not yet progressed to the point where we can propose starting on Turkey's screening.
Next year we will be embarking on the most politically sensitive stage of the accession negotiations.
We will lay down a general framework for the negotiation of the financial chapter which ensures that it can be dealt with in a common framework, and we will be doing this very early in 2002, so that the Spanish Presidency will have the chance to keep to the timetable.
We are confident that the enlargement negotiations can be successfully completely on the basis of the current acquis.
In our proposal, we will strictly observe the expenditure limits of Agenda 2000.
We will thus make no proposals going beyond them, nor will we make proposals binding the European Union beyond 2006, so that it is perfectly clear that the Commission's strategy involves no financial risks.
Finally, let me add that negotiations are currently concerned with issues, the resolution of which will have direct impact on the living conditions of citizens in the accession countries.
The decisions made now will influence either positively or negatively the acceptance of the accessions in the candidate countries.
We must therefore make every effort to give the citizens in today's and tomorrow's Member States all the information about enlargement.
No partner should be subjected to excessive demands in the accession process.
It is therefore essential that negotiations be both flexible and result-oriented.
The Commission will, then, on the basis of next year's progress reports, submit recommendations on the readiness for accession of those countries that are adequately prepared.
It will make every effort to ensure that negotiations with these countries can be concluded successfully.
It will also produce a revised pre-accession strategy for those countries which are unable or unwilling to conclude negotiations by the end of 2002.
These countries must not be made to feel that they are being left behind.
They therefore require special attention and special instruments, which we will be proposing in the 2002 Strategy Paper.
Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
I would remind the House that this debate consists of an exchange of short questions and answers.
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, I have, of course, some questions, but a few statements are in order.
Let me say first, Mr President of the Commission, that we are glad to see you here.
We were, though, somewhat astonished to see your name appear on the monitor during our bureau meeting.
It took us by surprise, which may have been a mistake by our group.
We do, of course, make mistakes, but in general, according to what I hear around the place, it was not known that the President of the Commission was going to be here this afternoon. We are glad that you are here, even though we would have liked prior notice.
A second point, to which I would also like an answer, is that I was told this morning while the Group Chairmen were holding press conferences, that Mr Verheugen had also held a press conference.
I would be very interested to know, Commissioner, whether it was on the subject to which you have just been speaking.
If you can shed some light on that, then so much the better.
Now for my questions. First, let me inform you that our group's leaders had a meeting in Hungary last week.
There was grave concern in Hungary that the enlargement could, for them, be delayed if in another country, namely Poland, developments were not proceeding as quickly as might be wished.
Of course, we all want Poland to be in the first round of enlargement, but a consequence of that must not be that, if a Member country is not yet ready, the others have to wait and we cannot keep to the 2004 deadline.
Each country must be assessed on its own merits if enlargement is to be able to take place at all.
I would be obliged if you could say something about this.
I then have a very specific question.
There was also disquiet in Hungary about the critical judgment passed on the 'status law' on Hungarians in other countries.
This law was adopted by 95% of the Hungarian Parliament, and a commission of the European Council, the so-called Venice Commission, explicitly stated that this law was acceptable.
One last question: How do you see the overcoming of the past with reference to some EU countries today?
I am thinking of the Benes decrees and of the acquisition of land in Poland, for example.
Can you say something more about that?
Can we take as our starting point statements which, if these countries join the European Union, will make it possible for them to have a future with a clear record, which we of course very much want?
We want the 2004 deadline to be adhered to, so that these peoples can take part in the next European elections.
Mr President, I would like to clarify the issue of Poland, at last, because the situation is incredible: in Poland they are saying that we favour the smaller States while the smaller States say we favour Poland.
Well then, we need to make it clear once and for all that good progress is being made, and by 'good progress' we mean good progress for Poland as well.
This country has made excellent progress, and so there is no need to put Poland in a different category from the others.
I feel, or rather I must express my utmost satisfaction at the fact that, looking back at the rate of progress, it is apparent that Poland has displayed remarkable energy and ability in this race, on this journey towards enlargement, towards accession.
I can therefore find no reason to differentiate between Poland and Hungary or between Hungary and Poland.
Sir, neither the President of the Commission nor I myself have held any press conference.
We abide fully by what we agreed.
It is for that reason that the press conference is to take place at 6 p.m., after Parliament has been informed.
I regularly talk to journalists, as you well know.
There was, though, no press conference, and that is an important distinction.
As far as the Hungarian law on status is concerned, we notified the Hungarian government of problems with this law from the point of view of the acquis communautaire even before the law was enacted.
These problems were then taken into legislative account, so that we have no problems with Community law.
My estimation of the Venice Commission differs from your own.
The Venice Commission ruled that whether the Hungarian Status Law is contrary to international law or not is dependent on the way it is implemented.
We have therefore had discussions for some time with the Hungarian government and with the governments of neighbouring countries in order to ensure that Hungary's neighbours are involved in finding a way of implementing it on which they can all agree.
The Hungarian government is thankfully endeavouring to bring this about, and the Romanian and Slovak governments are also ready to play their part.
The Benes decrees have not to date been the subject of negotiations, since property issues, as you well know, are not covered by Community law.
As regards the acquisition of land, I expect something to happen very quickly in the relevant negotiations with Poland.
During my visit to Warsaw last week, the Polish government announced that it would be taking a flexible approach to this issue.
Mr Verheugen, no press conference has been held but the press already has your text.
I think that is the cause of this confusion.
Madam President, I would like to put three short questions.
The first is to Mr Verheugen: You have announced that there will be additional resources or an additional programme for modernising and adapting administration.
I would be interested to know whether these are financial resources deducted from other programmes for these countries on an anticipatory basis.
Perhaps you could define that a bit more exactly.
My second is this: Commissioner, the Court of Auditors' report that we discussed today criticises the Commission for the absence of definite criteria in its programmes to reinforce atomic power stations, that is, to increase the safety of their reactors.
Are you prepared to consider the possibility that the Commission is not drawing up any criteria, that is to say, any general criteria, but only criteria for checking reactor safety improvement measures, carried out with the support of Commission resources?
My third question, concerning Cyprus and Turkey, has already been briefly alluded to.
The Turkish Prime Minister has just made statements in what may be a new form, to the effect that, if it came to it, the northern part of Cyprus might be annexed.
Does the Commission have a clear, official and unambiguous answer to this?
Madam President, I will answer the honourable gentleman's questions as follows.
Firstly, resources for the additional measures to improve implementation are being taken from the Phare budget, so additional resources are not being drawn on, nor are resources being transferred.
This is, rather, a change of priorities in Phare's programming, something of which, by the way, I informed Parliament some time ago.
We had also said that we were ready to adjust priorities in view of the fallout from 11 September, if it were a question of meeting stricter conditions in internal and legal policy, police cooperation and the securing of our external frontiers.
As you know, the Commission has no authority in matters of reactor safety.
I do not know what the Court of Auditors is referring to in this instance; it may be to the work of the Council working party on nuclear energy issues, which, however, is not a Commission office.
The Commission is in no way responsible and is not involved in any steps to improve nuclear safety in candidate countries.
All the Commission does is to negotiate the required decommissioning of the reactors, regarded by the Member States as incapable of being retrofitted, with the relevant countries such as Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia and then go on to implement such decommissioning.
This has to a large degree been completed, as you know.
We still await a final closure date for Ignalina II in Lithuania and an offer of finance for this, still outstanding, is expected in the near future.
Apart from that, we in the Commission have nothing to do with the construction of further nuclear power stations in Central and Eastern European countries.
I must say quite frankly that this is the first time I have heard of this criticism by the Court of Auditors.
I would myself be very grateful, and I imagine the President would be too, if the Commission were to have responsibility for nuclear safety standards.
I must, though, tell you that the Member States, and you as an Austrian Member will know how watchful the Member States are in the Melk process in which the Commission is mediating between Austria and the Czech Republic, determinedly refuse to let the Commission create conditions that would lead to the rise of European Community law on reactor safety standards.
I am, though, quite happy to come back to this subject when I have been informed about this report by the Court of Auditors.
As regards the Turkish Prime Minister's statement, what Mr Ecevit has said is nothing new to me; I have heard it in many conversations with him and read it in articles by him for over a year.
Our response is quite clear.
If, first condition, no political reunification of Cyprus is achieved; if, second presupposition, the Member States decide, and Parliament agrees, that Cyprus should be admitted in any case; and if, thirdly, Turkey were then to react in that way - all hypothetical questions at present - if, though, that were to happen, it would result in probably the worst crisis ever in relations between Turkey and the European Union.
I do not at present see how we could quickly extricate ourselves from such a crisis.
Madam President, I should like to return to the question of what used to be called the Madrid criterion, the question of implementation capacity.
How will the institutions in general, in particular the Member States, judge, and by what criteria will they judge, whether the applicants have arrived at the happy state of having an implementation capacity?
I share and salute the headline goal, but I wonder what is its measurable content?
The problem is that in Parliament we have not had the opportunity yet to read all these contrary reports which have been adopted.
But given the comments that the Commissioner has just made about Turkey, could he characterise - because we have not yet had the chance to study it - the political mood of the Turkey report?
I hope it is a report which gives sufficient and due recognition to serious attempts at change.
There are serious deficiencies which remain, but engagement with Turkey in the light of the earlier comments is an even more profound necessity in the near future than it has been in the recent past.
I am obliged to the honourable Member.
The monitoring of progress in the capacity to implement is a standard procedure that we have developed over a considerable time.
We simply observe what legislation was taken over, and whether adequate material and human resources were available to make this legislation a reality.
It goes without saying that we also observe whether it actually works in practice.
This monitoring is going on constantly.
The information required for it comes to us from the most diverse sources, not only from our own, but also, for example, information is used which comes to us from Parliament.
We have a system that puts us in a position to say at any time to any given country how far we have got with their capacity to implement.
This procedure has been well established and has proved its worth.
As regards Turkey, I can tell the honourable gentleman that the current picture presents varied aspects.
There are positive things in it.
One is no doubt that the Accession Partnership is now working in all its aspects.
All its elements are present and are being kept to.
In this respect, relations between us and Turkey were never before as close as they are now.
Another positive element is no doubt the remarkable progress being made in constitutional reform and also in legislative matters, towards democratisation and respect for human rights.
This is surely still dependent on the extent to which these constitutional changes and legislation are actually experienced in the country's day-to-day reality.
There has been no progress in the economic sphere.
So much is well known.
There has been remarkable progress in conforming to the acquis.
That is the good I have to report.
On the negative side, I have to say that, as already stated, the human rights situation is still unsatisfactory.
I must say that I had expected more from Turkey by way of cooperation in resolving the Cyprus issue.
We have already discussed this in another context.
I am also disappointed by Turkey's conduct as regards the issue of European security and defence policy.
I do not find it appropriate for a country desirous of being a member of the European Union to hinder the European Union from making progress with a significant aspect of integration.
This is, in my view, not the sort of behaviour that we should expect of a candidate country.
Commissioner, there are agreements between some of the candidate countries, such as the customs union agreement between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, rather than the Visegrad agreement, which could render the situation rather more complex should only one of the two countries join the Union, for example, if the Czech Republic were to join but not Slovakia or vice versa.
Now, as has rightly been said, all the countries have to respect all the necessary parameters and criteria.
Should this situation arise, what line should we take?
Secondly, with regard to countries such as Croatia, countries which are not yet candidates, that is, although they have made considerable progress towards applying for and achieving the status of candidate countries, what is the current situation?
Lastly, we have touched on the issue of Cyprus, with regard to which you said that were we to be faced with a reaction such as that threatened by the Turkish Prime Minister, there would be a very serious crisis.
My feeling is that, in this regard, we are proceeding almost without any safety net at all, for such a reaction would involve the annexing of part of the territory of the European Union.
It may be that we should safeguard ourselves against such an eventuality and allow ourselves a moment' s reflection before coming up against this situation, which I feel is so very sensitive.
Madam President, I would like to say, in response to the honourable gentleman's first question, that free trade agreements between candidate countries and third countries should of course cease before accession, but it goes without saying that they cannot continue to be valid after it.
Free trade agreements between two candidate countries would in fact create problems if these countries were then to accede at different times.
I must say, though, that the problem is a very limited one, as the countries you have mentioned are covered by the Europe Agreements, which already provide for quite wide-ranging liberalisation of trade in goods, and also of the traffic in services and other economic relations, so that a European solution can be found for this problem should it eventually arise.
I do not, though, think it likely that it will.
The question about Croatia is outside my remit; I would have to ask the President to say something about it.
I would add, speaking of Cyprus, that I clearly stated that you were putting hypothetical questions.
I do not as a rule like answering hypothetical questions, but you were entitled to an assessment of the situation.
I did also say, though, that the Commission has not changed the clear line it has taken, that we must do everything, yes everything, to achieve a political solution to the conflict before accession negotiations are completed.
I have repeatedly appealed to all parties and must again say clearly that it is in the particular interest of the Turkish Cypriot community that a political solution be found before the accessions take place, as nobody will profit as much as the Turkish Cypriot community from Cyprus' membership of the European Union.
For that reason, any policy that bars access to the European Union to the Turkish Cypriot community in Cyprus is a policy which directly, clearly and unambiguously works against the interests of the people there.
As you will remember, Mr Podestà, the very week after the political changeover and the establishment of a situation of recognised democracy in the country, I lost no time in going to Croatia to instigate relations of cooperation, which are currently progressing very well.
In recent weeks, we have had an official meeting with the Croatian Prime Minister and we have continued along that path: we are genuinely encouraging Croatia in all its efforts to establish a closer relationship with the European Union.
Clearly, the tragedy of war and its repercussions on the country' s economy are still very deeply felt and mean that things will take time, but we are actively doing everything we can to speed up the process.
Madam President, I have three questions.
I would first like to say that I find it a very good thing that the Commission is at last turning its mind to supporting the strengthening of administration.
But my question is whether it is also going to look at the need for administration to really involve the citizens, so that things that go without saying, here in the European Union, are also put into practice there?
My second question concerns the action plan and finance.
If you are allocating more resources from the Phare programme for the support of the institutions, does that then mean that resources are being removed from the other important area of social and economic cohesion, in other words that we are no longer supporting the halting of increasing social decay, which is a core problem in these countries, even though it is urgently necessary?
My last question concerns a point which the report does not mention at all. Does the Commission intend to encourage the Council to publish a European programme for the Roma people, something which is in my view urgently required?
In almost all countries at present, the Roma minority's human and democratic rights are being violated as much as they have been in the past.
This can clearly not be resolved by these accession candidates on an individual basis; it is a European issue that must be dealt with by a European programme.
Madam, it goes without saying that the degree of citizen participation that is normative in the European Union is also required of the candidate countries, and is a component factor both in the monitoring they receive and in the support they are given.
Secondly, the resources about which Mr Swoboda has already asked are not taken from the country-specific programmes, but are multi-country programmes, which relate to all countries and which, if you want to put it that way, are kept in the central reserve.
No one country therefore receives one single euro less from the projects which have been discussed up to now.
The burden is not therefore borne by other projects.
On the subject of a European Roma project: this has not yet in fact been included in the Commission's proposals.
Discussion of the subject is already in progress in some of the candidate countries, which are saying that this is a European problem and must therefore be dealt with by a European Community programme.
As far as I am aware, this approach is not shared by most of the Member countries.
In any case, a specific European Roma programme would require significant material resources.
I have to answer your question by saying that the Commission has not as yet made such a proposal, but is concentrating on helping the candidate countries with the implementation of their national strategies to integrate the Roma.
Perhaps I should point out that we have very strict requirements on this point and demand of all the candidate countries with a Roma population that they present and implement a medium-term strategy towards the social integration of the Roma and the removal of social discrimination.
As you know, we are giving these programmes very substantial support by means of pre-accession instruments.

Madam President, Commissioner, you said that you had not held a press conference.
That appears to be the case, but can you confirm that you held a press briefing this morning, while the groups' press conferences were going on?
Secondly, should this question be answered in the affirmative, I would very much like to ask the President of the Commission whether he thinks that press briefings of this sort are conducive to cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, when we should be the first to be informed.
Madam President, I can tell the honourable gentleman that there was no briefing either; on the contrary, I have conversations with the press every day, background discussions with many different journalists.
Such a conversation took place today, but it was not a briefing.
It was a background discussion, which was not intended for publication.
I think you will agree that it is a fairly subtle distinction, Mr Verheugen.
Madam President, Mr Swoboda's question on reactor safety raised the question in my mind of whether the Commission can make it clear not only to its own bureaux, but also to the Member States and their governments, and certainly also to the European Parliament, that we cannot, in negotiations, demand more from the candidates for accession that we ourselves comply with as Member States of the European Union.
I believe that this is not quite clear to all areas of all our institutions.
Perhaps it should again be highlighted in the coming year.
The second question I would like to put is this. In your report, you are very optimistic that ten countries will have the chance to sign the Accession Treaty at the end of next year.
As you have expressed it, but I believe it needs to be expressed even more clearly: that is the assessment of today.
This means that, if countries fall behind next year because of poor performance on the political front, the list could well comprise fewer than ten, so that great individual efforts will be necessary and today's judgment will offer no security.
To this will, of course, be added the issues of implementation and of administrative capacity.
Your paper points out that work will be being done on implementation even after the Treaty is signed.
What certainty will there be, though, on the day the Treaty is signed, that administrative capacity will actually be in place when accession becomes effective?
Madam President, the honourable gentleman's first question can be answered only with great difficulty.
I sometimes feel that at one point or another we are demanding of the candidate countries something that the Member States are not doing themselves.
This, though, has to do with the criteria we have and our obligation to report very precisely on the extent to which they are complied with - or not, as the case may be.
Today, I said to the Commission, and on the same subject, that we must always imagine what progress reports would look like if the same criteria were applied to the Member States.
The Member States would never allow us to do any such thing, but so much of what we criticise in candidate countries or describe as incompatible with the Copenhagen criteria, could, perhaps, also be found in one Member State or another.
So, at this point, I recommend modesty to our Member States.
Nothing more can, of course, be demanded in the negotiations themselves than is required of the Member States.
The negotiations are very precisely attuned to the acquis and to nothing else.
They touch on nothing else.
The problem you have described can therefore only arise when considering the question of whether candidate countries comply with the indeed very vaguely formulated political or economic accession criteria.
My answer is that it may be that we are sometimes asking for more.
As regards the other question of the ten countries, the Commission said today in fact, that we must prepare for the accession of all those which have complied with the conditions and completed negotiations by the end of 2002.
This represents rejection of the idea of forming what might be termed political groups, and is, in the Commission's judgment, the correct interpretation of the Helsinki and Gothenburg Decisions.
It was stated in Helsinki that all countries that had been invited to negotiate should have a chance to conclude, which can only mean that it was considered that their accessions could be simultaneous with those of the countries which had been negotiating since Luxembourg, and Gothenburg envisaged the first accessions taking place before 2004.
It necessarily follows from this that we must prepare for the accession of up to ten countries, I will not say ten, but up to ten, because ten countries have set themselves the goal of completing negotiations by 2002.
Whether it will actually come to that, I do not know.
The Commission will produce its concluding opinion next year, and will do so in strict accordance with the principles and rules that it itself has proposed.
As I said here in Parliament during the most recent discussion on enlargement, it is a subject on which we cannot let ourselves make political decisions as it were in the worst or narrowest sense of the word, that is, saying on the basis of purely political considerations that one country is coming in and another is not.
Such a decision must much rather be founded on compliance with the criteria and on the outcome of the negotiations.
The Commission's proposal will be couched in those terms.
None of the ten countries that currently believe they will manage it can evade the possibility of us saying at the end of the day: this country is not ready.
Let me say it clearly: none of them.
Madam President, Commissioner, I have just been listening to what you have been saying about the enlargement of the EU.
I have heard a lot about the shortcomings of Turkey, about constitutional changes, the democratisation process and human rights.
My question is, what is there in the accession partnership document about the rights of the Kurds?
What is the situation with regard to the rights of 25 million people who have not been mentioned in this discussion?
I ask you, Commissioner, to tell us how the rights of the Kurds are affected and how you assess the political situation in Turkey as regards constitutional changes and the Kurdish question.
Madam, I regret to have to tell you that the accession partnership with Turkey was not the subject of today's discussions.
Today we in fact discussed and adopted twelve accession partnerships, but not the accession partnership with Turkey, and that because it entered into force only in the early part of this year, and updating it after only a few months would make no sense.
We will therefore be proposing the updating of the accession partnership with Turkey only next year and will produce the assessment you have asked for in that context.
Madam President, I actually have one question for Commissioner Verheugen.
Not so long ago, he announced, with our blessing, the launch of a large information campaign both within the European Union and in the candidate countries, highlighting the advantages of the EU' s enlargement.
How does he explain in that light and in the context of the activities carried out, that the support for enlargement, both in the EU and in the candidate countries, is declining despite this effort?
What does the Commission intend to do about this?
Sir, for a start I cannot see that support for enlargement is decreasing either in candidate countries or in Member States.
The figures with which I am acquainted indicate the precise opposite.
Quite apart from that, public opinion on the subject is, if I may say so, extraordinarily fickle.
It evidently very much depends on who is asking, what is being asked, and when.
In this way, you can obtain quite different results in the same country at the same time.
I know all the surveys that are being done, and my analysis is that we must not work on the assumption that we are dealing with dwindling support.
Secondly, as regards communications strategy, the European Parliament, and you as a Member of it will be aware of this, has considered it right, for reasons it has made known to us, to make the funds available relatively late in the day, only, in fact, in the course of this year.
The truth is that all the measures could be put in motion only after the summer recess.
You cannot expect that I should be able to supply you with some sort of report on the results of a campaign that started only eight weeks ago.
I must make it clear that this is outside the Commission's remit.
The Commission made its proposal on the implementation of a communication strategy in April 2000, therefore only a few months after we took office.
That it took so long for this strategy to become reality in the European institutions is in this instance regrettable.
I do not believe, though, that it is too late, because only now that the results of negotiations are becoming evident is it right and necessary to fully apply this strategy.
This strategy is in no way about indoctrinating people or, as you have suggested, convincing them of advantages, but about giving them an objective basis on which to form their own opinions and judgments.
The Commission would indeed not be permitted to do more.
That concludes this item of the agenda. I would like to thank Commissioner Verheugen and President Prodi.
Madam President, on a point of order.
This was advertised as a "catch the eye of the President" session, open to all Members of Parliament.
In fact it has been nothing more than a private meeting of Parliament's Bureau.
Group leaders have been invited to speak, Mr Poettering was invited to speak twice and the groups have been asked to put forward speakers.
It has not been an open debate and I really do not know why the rest of us turn up if you are going to conduct business this way.
This is not in the interests of Parliament.
I must protest at the way in which you have conducted this matter.
Mr Titley, I quite understand that Members whose names have not been called feel somewhat frustrated.
Having said this, I would remind you that this was a question and answer session.
It is true that some Members far exceeded their allotted speaking time.
Should I have cut them off because of that?
You are well aware that that is not my way of doing things.
I am sure you will also understand that I naturally had to give precedence to the rapporteurs, to those who have worked as rapporteurs on this subject.
I would also point out, for your information, that a number of rapporteurs were unfortunately unable to take the floor, including three from the European People' s Party: Mrs Carlsson, Mrs Stenzel and Mr Van Orden, not to mention Mr Haarder and Mr Beazley.
So you see, Mr Titley, how difficult this was to manage.
I think that Parliament should make a decision, but it should be aware that if the question and answer session overruns, and I would gladly have extended it by a good half-hour, as I think the subject deserved it, the time devoted to questions to the Commission may have to be reduced.
You can imagine the reaction of your fellow Members who, as you know, are extremely anxious that the time allocated to questions to the Commission be scrupulously observed.
You know that, when this is not the case, those Members call us to task and they are quite right to do so.
I have tried to act for the best.
If I was wrong, I apologise.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Following Mr Titley's observation, I would simply say that this is a most important question.
I am sure those who were not able to speak were very pleased to hear the Commissioner's comments.
I will submit my questions to him in writing.
I should like to point out that four of our colleagues here today asked three questions.
If the President, and indeed colleagues, would limit themselves to one question, by my mathematics nine further speakers might have been called.
We take note of these comments, which are inevitable, furthermore, given the lack of time.
Question Time (Commission)
The next item is Questions to the Commission (B5-0338/2001).
Part I
Question No 28 by (H-0857/01):
Subject: Afghanistan and drugs According to the latest annual report of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme, opium production in Afghanistan has fallen strikingly as a result of the Taliban's prohibition policy. From being the world's leading exporter, the country now accounts for only 10% of world trade in opium.
The events of 11 September have also contributed to the disruption of farming, including the cultivation of opium.
In the light of this situation and the desperate plight of the population, what practical initiatives can the Commission take, particularly through its participation in the UN anti-drug programme, to provide relief and aid to the communities affected, and to dissuade producers from reverting to opium growing or selling the stocks that they still have?
Mr President, the Commission shares the honourable Member' s desire to provide adequate support for the Afghan people, of whose difficult situation we are all well aware.
The significant assistance which the Community had been giving to the Afghan population has increased recently.
The Community finances actions in the following areas: emergency aid, aid to displaced persons, aid for food safety, human rights and landmines.
The assistance is implemented speedily through a wide network of non-governmental organisations.
In this way, we contribute to reducing the dependence on poppy cultivation of the people who receive this aid.
The food safety programme is of particular importance, since it provides seeds, tools and all the necessary elements for alternative crops.
Obviously, no donor has been able to offer assistance in the field of compliance with the law in order to combat drug trafficking in Afghanistan, owing to the government of that country.
However, the Commission has supported programmes in this sector, in countries which play an essential role in the heroin trafficking routes towards the European Union, such as the States of Central Asia: Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, the Ukraine, Moldavia, Belarus, Bulgaria and Rumania.
It is still unknown whether, given the current changing situation, the significant reduction in poppy cultivation observed by the UNIDCP 2000/2001 will continue and, furthermore, according to the United Nations, the trafficking in refined heroin from Afghanistan does not appear to be diminishing.
According to the estimates of this United Nations body, the stocks accumulated before the crisis would keep the European market supplied for the next three to four years.
Thank you, Commissioner, for the information which you have given us.
However, I should like to ask if the immediate intention is for the European Commission programme to deal with this problem, on its own or through UN programmes, within the framework of the reconstruction of Afghanistan and assistance to neighbouring countries.
As you know, Commissioner, the European Commission is spending a great deal of money on public awareness campaigns and the European Drugs Monitoring Centre.
If we want to be sincere and efficient, we need to take more direct and effective action at the root of the evil, such as in Afghanistan.
I share the honourable Member' s concern but, as I have said, the reality is that the United Nations' Cooperation and Development Plan for Afghanistan has not been able to deal with ensuring compliance with the law, owing to the Taliban government which is still in Afghanistan.
I hope that, once things have changed in Afghanistan, as we all wish, and a government is in place which fulfils the minimum requirements in terms of respect for human rights, combating drug trafficking and other similar issues, we will be able to deal with issues such as the real application and the real effectiveness of this aid, which, I insist, currently has to be channelled through non-governmental organisations such as the UNHCR or the Red Cross, which are the usual channels of aid in these cases.
Because it is clear that the aid, which has been interrupted since 11 September for obvious reasons, is going to be renewed as soon as possible.
And I hope that on this occasion it is not restricted solely to funding and supported activity in the rural field, in the alternative crop sector, but that it also allows us to cooperate and maintain greater supervision of the real effectiveness of the authorities in their fight against this type of crop.
Question No 29 by (H-0849/01):
Subject: Threat to nuclear facilities in the aftermath of 11 September Will the Commission establish the appropriate institutional instruments to prepare, within six months, a thorough analysis of a range of options for reducing the threat posed by deliberately crashing aircraft and other acts of malice at nuclear facilities, including the prospective benefits of transferring spent fuel to dry storage facilities that are robust against acts of malice, and suspending reprocessing until stocks of liquid high-level radioactive waste have been vitrified or otherwise used as part of an immobilisation programme for surplus plutonium?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the physical and operative security of nuclear installations falls within national competence, provided that compliance with the provisions of the Euratom Treaty is guaranteed.
Each State of the Union is carrying out its own analysis of the situation in the light of the terrorist attacks of 11 September and, in this regard, they will adopt the necessary additional measures to increase the physical protection of nuclear installations and the materials which are used or stored in them.
We hope that all the existing options are analysed in detail.
For obvious security reasons, many of the details relating to these additional measures cannot be made public.
On the other hand, it is clear that the best way to reduce the threat posed to nuclear installations, or any other installation, by the possibility of terrorists deliberately crashing an aircraft into them, is to make it impossible, or extremely improbable, that they may hijack a large commercial aircraft in the first place.
In this regard, the Commission would like to remind you of the measures it proposed on 10 October for the adoption and application of common European Union rules in the field of civil aviation security, and which was first presented at the last Council of Transport Ministers.
These measures are intended to deal with this point.
Commissioner, I find that answer extraordinarily complacent.
We all know that nuclear power plants were not designed to withstand collisions with large aircraft, particularly jumbo jets.
You say that it is not that easy to hi-jack an airplane.
Only yesterday there was another terrible accident in New York.
I hope it was an accident and not an act of terror: at this point in time it is not entirely clear.
Let us all pray that it was merely an accident and not something that was designed to kill all the people on board.
I am sure we all sympathise with the families.
This is a very serious matter.
All I am asking is, will the Commission prepare an analysis?
Surely you can say "yes" to that and not just pass it off as the responsibility of the Member States.
You have powers under Articles 34 and 35 of the Euratom Treaty.
According to a recent European Parliament study you are not exercising your powers under those articles.
Could you please comment on that aspect of my question.
Have you looked at that study?
Have you looked at your powers, and can you at least prepare some kind of an analysis?
I am not asking you to disclose the discussions you are having with the Member States.
Clearly, that may be inappropriate.
But can you not do something?
Mr President, Commissioner, the safety of nuclear installations is a problem for the whole of Europe and primarily an environmental issue.
Safety is, in the final analysis, a European added value.
Could you consider encouraging the preparation of a Green Paper on the safety of reactors or nuclear installations, so that in future a relatively objective assessment of the subject may be guaranteed?
Mr President, according to the Euratom Treaty, security is the national competence of each Member State.
However, at the moment the WENRA, where all the regulators of the different Member States of the European Union meet, is working to find equivalent security standards which, in my opinion (which is shared by the services, although it is not an official position of the Commission, and I am therefore speaking personally), are necessary and beneficial for all: for the States which have chosen the non-nuclear option, but also for everyone else, since I believe, like you, that if there is an accident in a nuclear power station, the repercussions will transcend administrative borders and the problem is pan-European or even global.
We must therefore support the Vienna Commission, which depends on the United Nations.
These equivalent security standards should therefore be established, with a degree of obligation which is similar to that demanded in the Community, which would offer greater safeguards for the whole world.
Our analyses are based on the situation and, if it is necessary to propose a modification to the Treaty, we would have to consider doing so.
I have a supplementary question to Mrs Ahern's question.
Is the recent decision giving the go-ahead to the MOX plant at Sellafield not unacceptable?
Is this not a violation of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea?
We have been raising the Sellafield issue here for many years.
I would like to ask what your position is with regard to the UN conventions?
Do you believe in upholding them?
Do you consider that the authorities responsible for Sellafield have a duty to consult Ireland in this decision?
Do you consider that even at this stage a full European-backed environmental impact assessment should be carried out?
Mr Fitzsimons, I feel obliged to tell you that you have taken it upon yourself to bring forward Question No 62.
I frankly do not believe that this obeys the Rules of Procedure.
We had said goodbye to the Vice-President for today.
Thank you for your attention.
Energy drinks were discussed at the 84th meeting of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs on 19 September 2001.
As noted, two Member States have reported deaths in their countries associated with the consumption of those products.
In neither case, however, was there any evidence that the consumption of energy drinks was the cause of death.
Both Member States have commissioned their own research, investigating the available data on the effect of these drinks on health.
Recently another Member State produced a list of incidents linked to the consumption of such products, but without any substantiating evidence.
None of the Member States concerned took any steps to restrict or prohibit energy drinks in their own territory.
The Standing Committee noted a need for further information on the potential effects on health of ingredients in the products and the Scientific Committee for Food is examining data submitted by a manufacturer of such products regarding the safety of one of the products in question.
According to information, further studies are nearing completion.
At the above mentioned meeting of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs, the Commission repeated its request to Member States to submit information on the safety of products on their markets.
The Commission understands the concerns that have been expressed and it therefore intends to work with Member States to look at the issue in depth and identify the appropriate course of action to ensure a high level of protection for consumers.
So-called energy drinks are not covered by any specific legislation and are not subject to an approval procedure at Community level.
In the absence of Community legislation, Member States may apply national rules without prejudice, of course, to the provisions of the Treaty.
Overall, Member States should ensure that products placed on their markets are safe.
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.
However, you must allow me to couple my thanks with my disappointment at the tenet of your reply.
Commissioner, as you know full well, we are talking about a public health issue here and I should like to remind you that, in cases such as these, we do not need proof, we just need an indication, especially when we are talking about the public health of young people, and it is young people who are consuming these energy drinks.
To give you a specific example, in Greece there have been five cases in which people presented symptoms which related directly to the three active ingredients in these drinks.
I should like to ask you to repeat, because this has happened in the past and Community legislation subsequently prohibited Greece from banning this substance, if these drinks could in fact be banned at national level, because the committee responsible in my country has objected to my initiative on the basis of the principles of internal trade.
It is the responsibility of Member States to initiate action if they have evidence of harm due to the consumption of a particular foodstuff.
The Commission can take temporary safeguard measures if it becomes aware of a serious risk from a product to the health and safety of consumers.
Once the Commission is informed of action by a Member State, then the need for action on a Community-wide basis can be assessed.
However, the Commission is not aware of action being initiated by any Member State.
In fact the two Member States that have reported deaths associated with consumption of energy drinks have stated that there is no evidence of the association and they have instigated their own investigations into the effect of such products on health.
The Commission has sought the cooperation of Member States in looking at this issue in depth and identifying the appropriate course of action.
I should like to thank Mrs Malliori for raising this issue and add to what she has said.
May I ask the Commissioner specifically about how these energy drinks are marketed in combination with alcoholic products.
For example, a growing trend, certainly in Scotland, has been the combination of the product Red Bull with vodka, which is exceedingly dangerous.
This is of great concern to me, since Scotland has one of the highest rates of under-age drinking, that is to say drinking by 15 year olds and under, in the European Union.
Could the Commissioner tell me whether the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs discussed the combination of energy drinks with alcoholic products and, if so, what research did it propose and what information did it think was needed?
I understand the concerns of the honourable Member.
I also have three children.
I know what is being consumed, mostly by young boys, so I understand her concern.
The Scientific Committee is also concerned.
It has noted that the possible interaction of the constituents of energy drinks has not been well studied, and considers that the possible interactions between caffeine, taurine and alcohol in humans may warrant investigation, particularly under conditions of exercise and consequent dehydration through sweating.
In the light of the advice from the Scientific Committee the Commission is holding discussions with Member States, with a view to ensuring that a draft Commission directive that includes specific labelling rules on caffeine in ready-to-eat foods is put into place.
Questions to Commissioner Reding
Question No 31 by (H-0772/01):
Subject: Ban on advertising directed at children In my question H-0663/01to the Council, I asked whether the Belgian Presidency intended to make the rules protecting children from television advertising more stringent and to support the position of the Swedish Presidency for a full ban.
The Council, however, replied that, in the absence of any proposal from the Commission, whether in the form of a specific proposal or of a point for inclusion in the revision of the 'Television without frontiers' directive scheduled for 2002, it was unable to consider the matter.
Will the Commission say what stage has been reached in its deliberations on this subject?
Mr President, as you are aware, the 'Television without frontiers' directive lays down the legal framework for television broadcasting in the European Union.
This directive contains provisions on the protection of minors, in particular Article 16, which lays down a number of rules with regard to advertising and minors.
The Commission undertook to carry out a study on the impact of television advertising and teleshopping on minors; this study was conducted by an independent advisor and has been published on the Commission website.
Moreover, the Commission will supplement its assessment of the chapter on advertising within the framework of its re-examination of the 2002 directive.
As Mr Papayannakis is doubtless aware, the consultation of professionals with regard to the revision of this directive began in 2001.
Their conclusions will be published at the beginning of 2002, after which the political discussion will commence.
We have also begun three studies, one of which will specifically examine the development of new advertising techniques. If we intend to revise the directive, we should look to the future, and not restrict ourselves to analysing the past or the present.
Therefore, as you can see, Mr President, the Commission is approaching this issue with a completely open mind, taking extensive advice, and only after listening, analysing and discussing the issue with Parliament, of course, as well as others, will the Commission submit any proposals with a view to revising the directive.
My question was slightly more coercive, he said jokingly.
I asked you to tell me what your current thinking is in the Commission.
Whenever I ask the Council of Ministers, they tell me they are waiting to see what the Commission has to say.
Someone needs to tell us exactly what stage we have reached so that we can prepare our response to your future plans.
I would remind the Commissioner that the Swedish Presidency, and perhaps you can confirm this, was in favour of a complete ban on advertising directed at children.
This provoked me, if you like, into tabling a supplementary question and it is on this that I should like you to comment, as the Commissioner at the present stage.
Unfortunately, I cannot say any more for the moment about the state of progress.
I am currently organising consultations with professionals, which will come to an end this year.
I shall then consult the politicians, and at the end of this series of consultations I shall make specific proposals.
I refuse to put the cart before the horse by making proposals first and only then taking advice. No.
First of all, I want to take advice, listen, and then make proposals.
I can tell you my own personal opinion: I have made it quite clear that I do not think a total ban on certain types of advertising would be effective unless the experience of other countries, in particular, shows that such a ban is indispensable for the achievement of an objective of legitimate general interest.
I asked the Swedish Presidency very clearly not to attempt to adopt this approach, as I knew that, at this stage, I would have to say no.
I have said no, I am taking advice, listening. I know that the Swedish government, which, for its own reasons, has banned advertising on its territory, is moving in that direction.
I also know that the majority of Member States are not moving in that direction.
I would like to ask the Commissioner whether she shares with me a concern that, in Sweden, because television advertising aimed at children is not allowed, there is a noticeable lack of programmes being produced specifically for children in Sweden.
Can she assure me that, in the study which she talked about - and I am delighted that she said it was going to be an open-minded study - this aspect will be fully considered and that, as there will be an explosion of television channels and television choice in future, she will look thoroughly at the possible impact of advertising on the generation of funds to produce high-quality programmes for children?
Mr President, my work has always had a dual nature.
My first task concerns the application of the decisions made by the 'Television without frontiers' directive.
For example, Article 16 restricts advertising aimed at children, as minors must be protected.
Obviously, we cannot do just anything in programmes intended for children.
However, I would like Parliament to help me out a bit, for example with regard to this point.
Can we make just any old film for children?
What sometimes shocks me just as much as certain adverts is the violence in films specifically intended for children.
We are analysing all that in order to find, together, the most effective way of making progress in this matter.
From the point of view of digital television, which will enable hundreds of programmes, including children' s programmes, to be broadcast, I would like us, in Europe, to have a high enough budget, sufficient investments to produce good children' s programmes.
This is my second task: ensuring that, in future, we have enough children' s films suitable for that age, films that are positive and are both educational and imaginative.
This question interests me very much and is quite appropriate in the middle of November, in the run-up to Christmas.
Many parents would be very supportive of Mr Papayannakis' question.
I would like to ask the Commissioner what comparisons have been made of the different advertising used in different countries at this time of year?
I would like to hear her opinion on the fact that, certainly in my own country, this advertising begins just after August, well before the immediate run-up to Christmas and can be very aggressive.
What kind of measures can you suggest be put in place to protect minors from this aggressive advertising?
It should be pointed out that the regulations applicable to television are completely different from those concerning the other media.
Television, therefore, is often subject to far more stringent regulations than those applicable to the other media, which are not always subject to specific rules concerning minors.
Thus, if you go into a supermarket with a child, for example, the child is swamped by unchannelled, uncontrolled advertising that is very different from televised advertising, which is actually regulated.
Many differences may be noted at Member State level as well, ranging from the age limits set, which differ significantly from one country to another, to the specific provisions governing certain sectors, such as financial activities and drinks advertising.
This proves that the approach adopted by the directive is the most appropriate as it provides a flexible framework within which the Member States have legislated according to their respective culture and traditions.
If Parliament considers that this framework should be changed, it will have the opportunity to say so loud and clear next year, as it will be given the opportunity to voice its opinion during the revision of the directive.
Whatever the case, if we amend the current measures, the amendments must be made within the limits of this directive.
Question No 32 by (H-0776/01):
Subject: World Anti-Doping Agency On 21 August 2001, the EU was represented by Commissioner Reding at the meeting held in Tallinn, to decide on the location of the headquarters of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
Does the Commission think that it might have been possible to avoid what happened in Tallinn?
Was the choice of Montreal the result of the failure of the European candidates to present a united front?
In 1999 the Commission submitted its support plan to combat doping.
Why not transform this plan into a full-blown programme and provide it with the appropriate funding?
As the honourable Member will be aware, the World Anti-Doping Agency decided, on 21 August 2001, to establish its future headquarters in Montreal.
This is a perfectly worthy city, which also offers many advantages.
It must be said that, amongst the candidate cities, there were also perfectly worthy European cities that also offered numerous advantages for hosting the headquarters of this agency.
What happened was that the European countries did not show sufficient coordination and the fact that so many European cities were put forward certainly favoured the choice of Montreal.
I wish to make it quite clear that the Belgian presidency cannot be held responsible for this failure. It did make considerable efforts to overcome the problems, unfortunately, however, without success.
Europe put forward several candidates, whereas other countries put forward only one, and it was this approach that won the day over the plethora of European candidates.
I must repeat the fact that this issue does not fall within the competence of the Community, but rather within that of the Member States.
We must now apply to the future the lessons we have learned from the Tallinn meeting.
The first lesson should be that of the European Union' s cohesion.
Furthermore, yesterday, the Fifteen' s Ministers for Sport met in Brussels for an informal Council, and cohesion was one of the main items discussed there.
The ministers agreed to join forces and adopt the same approach to combat the scourge that is doping, firstly at world level, in other words, to step up their action within the World Anti-Doping Agency and, secondly, at European level, where there are good grounds for putting a concerted anti-doping programme into action.
There are good grounds because Europe is the most advanced continent in the fight against doping, the greatest number of world-class sporting events takes place here and because Europe has the greatest number of competitions between clubs of different sporting disciplines.
Furthermore, we have the greatest number of accredited laboratories and we must continue to bring our knowledge to bear in the fight against doping at world level.
Yesterday, I informed the ministers that a Community plan is being drafted and they gave me the green light to put this into action.
I shall now begin consultations on the aspects to be included in this action plan and in 2002, we shall have the opportunity to discuss it properly.
I should also like to say that, in order to improve this European cohesion, which must apply not only to the fifteen governments, but must also exist between governments and sports federations, at the beginning of the Spanish presidency, a meeting will be held between the fifteen Ministers for Sports and the European sports federations to decide on the best approach to adopt in order to combat doping.
I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for your reply and your efforts with regard to the funding of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
In recent days, the sports press in our country has reported that there were problems with the funding from the European Commission.
I would like you to clarify whether these problems have been resolved after the meeting of Sports Ministers yesterday in Brussels and whether, if this is not the case, the Commission intends to channel this money towards other means of fighting doping or to stay with the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Mr President, the World Anti-Doping Agency is currently 100% funded, for the duration of a transitional period, by the International Olympic Committee and it has been decided that following this transitional period, 50% of the funds will be provided by the international sports federations and 50% by the governments of the various countries involved.
We have accepted this division.
It appears that of the part falling to national governments, 47.5% will be covered by the European Union.
This is a considerable proportion, but it is also proof of our sporting prowess on this continent.
Having said that, I am sure you are fully aware, Mrs Zabell, that we have interinstitutional rules governing payments made from the budget.
These interinstitutional rules force us to adhere to certain procedures, in order to ensure that taxpayers' money is used scrupulously.
The rules of the World Anti-Doping Agency do not currently match the very strict rules that apply in the European Union.
This is why Europe has asked the WADA to change its internal rules so that there is, first of all, a serious budget, a budget that is forecast over several years.
Secondly, there would need to be an internal rule ensuring that the other continents cannot impose a budget on the European Union but instead that we have a right of veto, and a right to examine proposals.
Thirdly, this 47.5% funding must also be matched by appropriate representation on the WADA' s board of management.
Once these three conditions are met, they will enable us to launch the process of the Council and the European Parliament taking a decision on funding the WADA.
For the moment, and until 3 December, when the World Anti-Doping Agency meets, the ball is in the Agency' s court.
Once the Agency has met the basic conditions enabling us to set the budgetary process in motion, however, the Commission will submit a proposal and the ball will then be in the court of the Member States and Parliament to implement this decision.
In the meantime, with regard to the year 2002 which is rapidly approaching, I would ask governments to shoulder their responsibilities.
They stated very clearly yesterday, in Brussels, that they are willing to do so.
It is therefore, up to the Council of Ministers to arrange these payments for 2002.
We are running a little late.
I would like to remind Members that the more supplementary questions there are, the fewer questions on the list will naturally be asked.
I would like you to bear this in mind.
Mrs Malliori has the floor for a supplementary question.
As you perhaps know, doping substances are traded on the free market so quickly that often, when one substance is detected and banned, a new one has already appeared.
The reasons for this are purely bureaucratic, for the simple reason that there are not enough laboratories.
Does the Commission intend to help so that substances can be recognised and banned immediately, thereby reducing the time available for new substances to reach the free market?
The World Anti-doping Agency was created precisely to answer such questions.
This is the body that has the task of drawing up the list of substances that should be banned and the body which governments and sporting bodies must then deal with.
Another point is research.
The Commissioner responsible, Philippe Busquin, and I have decided to open up European research and to put it at the service of the fight against doping, because we know that the inventors of new chemical formulae are often steps ahead of us.
We will, therefore, be making Europe' s research capabilities available to this fight.
Although we are right at the end of Mrs Reding' s time, we are going to ask the following question by Mr Collins. It is a very important question, but I would request, if possible, that only Mr Collins should ask questions.
And, if there are supplementary questions, they should be very brief, since it is a very broad question and it could take a long time, which would prevent us from moving on to questions to other Commissioners.
Question No 33 by (H-0805/01):
Subject: European Year of Languages The European Year of Languages 2001 is now coming to an end.
The Commission has co-funded 185 projects aimed at promoting the European Year.

Does the Commission consider that the objectives for the European Year are being met, and will it make a statement on how it considers the European Union can further develop the learning of languages in the EU, including the 60 plus European languages which are not official languages of the EU, and what measures it considers need to be introduced to help to further promote interest in and learning of languages among young people in the Member States?
As the honourable Member is well aware, the linguistic issue is one that is close to my heart, since I am a Luxembourger.
It is, moreover, one of the reasons why I have been so committed to the European Year of Languages 2001.
Something I did not realise at the beginning, when I launched this plan, was that there would be such enthusiasm, in all our Member States, about the linguistic phenomenon.
All sorts of organisations have lobbied, local councils have discussed language education, in short, there has been huge enthusiasm in all our Member States and this enthusiasm has also made itself felt at government level.
Some governments have adopted measures to give language learning greater priority in their curricula with effect from the 2001-2002 school year.
I shall be attending the Education Council on 29 November, and on that occasion we will be discussing the best way to follow up the European Year of Languages, because it is not enough to have launched an action and for that action to have been received with great enthusiasm on the part of the public; this action also needs to be followed up.
Let me reassure you that I shall be pursuing this course of action most conscientiously.
In concert with the Ministers for Education, I shall be making the frameworks of the Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes more open to language teaching than has been the case in the past, and then I shall be presenting a report on the very practical way we have been implementing on the ground, and that is not all, because the year is not yet over and many projects are still underway, the lessons we have learned from the public.
In this sense, when I talk about lessons that we have learned from the public, I am thinking of the entire linguistic panoply that we have in Europe, not only the 11 official languages, but also the sixty-odd languages spoken by Europe' s citizens.
Mr President, in deference to you and following the very comprehensive and satisfactory reply given to me by Commissioner Reding, I waive my right to a supplementary question.
We are going to ask the two supplementary questions, but we must try to be very specific.
May I frame a question which I hope the Commission will feel free to answer simply yes or no.
Wittgenstein told us that to choose a language is to choose a form of life.
I think, therefore, that if we lose languages we lose forms of life.
Does the Commissioner agree with me that it would be a tragedy for Europe if it loses languages such as Scots Gaelic, and Lowland Scots through neglect and that the lesser-used languages deserve greater encouragement than they get now?
Very good, I believe that Mr MacCormick has received the reply he wanted.
Many months ago, in the run up to the European Year of Languages, plenary unanimously adopted a report by Mr Graça Moura which proposed that ancient Greek and Latin, as the root languages of today's languages, should be taught in secondary schools throughout the European Union, so that contemporary languages could be taught properly and in greater depth.
I should like to ask, first, if you passed this recommendation on to the governments of the fifteen Member States and if you have any information as to whether or not this matter is being pursued.
The Commission has funded some 200 projects in the course of the Year of Languages. Some of these projects involved Greek and Latin.
The Commission has never, therefore, sidelined these languages.
It must, however, be pointed out, Mr President, that the Commission cannot set school curricula.
This is in the sphere of subsidiarity and, therefore, falls within the remit of the Ministers for Education.
This is why I conveyed to the Education Ministers all the discussions that took place in all the institutional frameworks, of which there were many, in order to tell them: 'Here you are, Europe' s citizens and their representatives want the linguistic element to become an important part of the education system' .
On the basis of all the reports available, at the end of November, the Ministers will have to decide and adopt a resolution, and then I shall ensure that this resolution is followed up with deeds, in other words that these ministers will make sure that their national or regional education systems, depending on the country, will provide the greatest possible range of languages, and from as early an age as possible.
I cannot, however, force a minister to put a particular language on his or her agenda.
I can only encourage him or her to do so.
Let me assure you that I am quite convinced that multilingualism represents Europe' s future, because it reflects cultural diversity, which is our true wealth.
Thank you very much, Mrs Reding.
We now come to questions to Mr Liikanen, and I would invite him to take his place.
We now have no choice but to strictly obey our time limits.
Questions to Mr Liikanen
As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 34, 35 and 36 will be taken together.
Question No 34 by (H-0786/01):
Subject: EU safety markings on instruments useable for torture I am concerned that EU Member States may be effectively allowing manufacturers of stun weapons (which are readily useable as instruments of torture) to use the European Commission CE 'safety' markings on their stun batons as a quality 'selling point'.
Can the Commission please indicate its position on the following points:
What is the process by which European CE standard marks are awarded and which Commissioner is responsible?
Can the Commission estimate how many stun weapon manufacturers are using the CE markings on their products?
Will the Commission take action to prevent stun weapon manufacturers using CE markings to promote the sales of their products?
Question No 35 by (H-0790/01):
Subject: Electric-shock devices The recent Amnesty International Report, Stopping the Torture Trade (2001), found that electric-shock devices have been used to torture or ill-treat people in prisons, detention centres and police stations in no less than 76 countries around the world.
The report also found that stun gun weapon manufacturers are advertising that these products have been 'awarded' the European CE standards mark.
I am concerned that EU Member States are effectively allowing stun gun weapon manufacturers to use the European Commission CE 'safety' markings on their stun batons as a quality 'selling point'.
Could the Commission clarify the process by which European CE standard marks are awarded, and explain to the European Parliament how many stun gun weapon manufacturers are using the CE marking on their products?
Could the Commission also take action to prevent stun gun weapon manufacturers using CE markings to promote sales of their products?
Question No 36 by (H-0801/01).
Subject: CE markings The Commission is aware that manufacturers and distributors of electro-shock devices (or 'stun guns' ) have been using CE markings to promote sales of their products, sometimes claiming that such marks constitute a 'guarantee' or an indication of product quality.
What steps is the Commission taking to ensure that CE markings are not used as a promotional device, both in the EU Member States and in third countries?
In cases where a product is manufactured, distributed and sold by companies based in countries not in the EU, can the Commission say what authority may challenge the validity of the CE mark, and prevent a firm from claiming that the CE mark on its product is a guarantee or an indication of quality?
Mr President, we have just been discussing minor languages.
That is the reason why I am now using the Finnish language.
Regulations on the CE marking are contained in a Council resolution of 1990 on the various phases of the compliance assessment procedures to be employed when applying directives on technical harmonisation, and also in a Council directive issued in 1993.
The latter stipulates that the CE marking should be incorporated in a number of directives on technical harmonisation that apply to specific industries.
Conformity marking must be affixed to any product falling within the scope of a technical harmonisation directive providing for it.
It signifies that the product complies with the legally binding requirements of the applicable technical harmonisation directive.
The manufacturer is responsible for affixing the CE conformity marking, although the directives often require the intervention of a third party conformity assessment body.
Member States are responsible for the designation of such bodies in accordance with the applicable provisions of the directives.
A number of services in the Commission are responsible for technical harmonisation directives providing for the CE conformity marking, although most fall under the responsibility of the Enterprise Directorate-General.
However, the Commission does not directly intervene in the evaluation of product conformity, nor in the award of the CE conformity marking.
All the manufacturers of stun weapons falling within the scope of technical harmonisation directives providing for CE conformity marking must affix this marking to the relevant products.
The Commission does not have information about the number of manufacturers involved.
In an earlier reply to a written question in 1997, the Commission noted that a wide variety of equipment could potentially be used for purposes of torture.
However it is not always possible to determine in advance what use such equipment will be put to.
Therefore it is not feasible to apply different treatment under these directives to equipment that could potentially be used as an instrument of torture.
Nevertheless, to take account of the concerns of Members of Parliament and many others who have written to me on the issue, the Commission, in particular the External Relations DG, is currently preparing a proposal for a Council regulation concerning trade in equipment which may be used for torture or for cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
The specific aim of this regulation is to lay down Community rules to prohibit the export, sale and transfer to third countries and the import and purchase from third countries of such equipment.
This proposal should also deal, as appropriate, with electrical devices.
The Commission will no doubt have realised, from the shared language of these three questions, that they originate outside this House, and indeed Amnesty International has been pressing us on this point.
I need not underline the significance and weight that attaches to representations by Amnesty International.
I am very grateful indeed to the Commissioner for his assurance in response to the third part of the question about the steps that are being taken to try to bring this matter under reasonable control.
It is a kind of irony, is it not, that the original idea of the CE marking was to give assurances about safety.
Well, if I am at the wrong end of a safe piece of torture equipment, it is not a good place to be.
Can you give us any indication of a timetable for the progress you hope to make on this?
The inter-service consultation in the Commission is going on right now.
Different services are expressing their opinions, so it is at an advanced stage of internal preparation today.
Further to the comments of my colleague, Mr MacCormick, I too was very concerned.
That is why I tabled the question.
The Amnesty International Report, Stopping the Torture Trade (2001), found that electric-shock devices have been used to torture or ill-treat people in prisons, detention centres and police stations in no less than 76 countries around the world.
The report also found that stun-gun weapon manufacturers are advertising these products with the 'awarded' CE standard.
As Mr MacCormick has said, the CE mark was meant to be a sign of quality and safety, but in a torture weapon it is pretty perverse and sickening.
I welcome the Commissioner's proposal and would welcome further clarification of the timetable.
To push things a little bit forward: you have explained how the CE mark is awarded, but how are the recipients of the awards monitored and have any CE marks been withdrawn, to your knowledge?
I will make two comments.
Firstly, according to the Amnesty International report referred to, stun guns are not used for torture or ill treatment by either the police or prison guards within the EU.
It is in the export to third countries where problems may arise.
As far as the CE marking is concerned, if it is incorrectly affixed and the competent authorities of the Member States know this, they can intervene with the manufacturer or his representative within the EU.
So there are possibilities for national authorities to take action.
It is our responsibility to monitor it properly.
The third part of my question is slightly broader.
I ask by what authority can the validity of a CE mark be challenged?
The Commissioner has said in his first answer that it was not the Commission that would make a ruling and in his second supplementary he said that it would be the competent national authority.
Is there any system of mutual recognition of a ruling by one national authority, or would it be necessary to challenge the use of a CE mark on something like a stun gun separately in each of the 15 Member States?
Is there not some overall body that can say this is valid?
It seems to be a very long-winded process if it has to be challenged 15 separate times.
The market surveillance authorities of Member States are responsible for this.
We do not have any European body to do this.
Questions can, of course, be raised and we can consider how the provision of information between the authorities could be improved and progress made.
However, we must remember that it is only the producers that are involved and that there may not necessarily be producers in all countries.
Question No 37 by (H-0800/01):
Subject: Proposed ban on hydrofluorocarbons Can the Commission confirm what steps it is taking with regard to the proposed ban on hydrofluorocarbons by the Danish government?
Denmark notified the Commission in March 2001 of a draft regulation intended to prohibit the import, sale and use of three greenhouse gases - HFC, PFC and SF6 - and products containing them as from 2006, except in the case of certain products and applications for which a different timetable was laid down.
This notification, pursuant to Directive 98/34/EC, allows the Commission and other Member States to carry out a prior examination of a measure which might create obstacles to the free movement of goods in the internal market.
Several Member States have reacted to the Danish proposal.
The Commission for its part has sent the Danish authorities a letter whose effect was to postpone the possibility of adopting the proposal until 6 September 2001.
Denmark must reply to the Commission and inform it of the action it intends to take on the proposal.
The position expressed by the Commission can be summarised as follows.
Firstly, the Commission recognises the legitimacy of the objective of the Danish proposal.
The text is aimed at combating greenhouse warming and at contributing towards a 21% reduction of six industrial gases to which Denmark committed itself at the Environment Council in June 1998.
The European Union, for its part, undertook under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce by 8% the emissions of the six industrial gases in question produced by all its Member States.
In the light of information already provided by Denmark, however, the Commission considers that the proposal is disproportionate to the objective pursued and does not appear, therefore, to comply with the rules of the internal market.
The Commission notes that there are technical measures for monitoring these emissions and that those measures create fewer distortions of intra-Community trade than a total prohibition.
Moreover, the Commission is not convinced that safe alternative measures which are technically compatible with the systems currently used exist in all cases or will be in existence within deadlines laid down by the Danish proposal.
If Denmark does not respond to the Commission's request the latter, as the guardian of the Treaties, may, whilst the proposal has been adopted, initiate infringement proceedings under Article 226 of the EC Treaty.
First of all, I thank the Commissioner for a comprehensive and clear reply.
Clearly the Commission has taken action with regard to this issue.
It is of concern not only to myself but to a great deal of other people in the Union, particularly those in the airconditioning industry, who could see a potential change in their market happening far too rapidly for them to respond with technical measures on with any kind of appropriate economic steps.
I hope the Commission will continue to press the Danish authorities to be quite clear about their intentions.
I hope that the Commission will seek further contact with the Danish authorities over and above the letters they have already sent, to ensure that a reply is received quickly.
The amount of uncertainty at the moment with regard to the intentions of the Danish Government is creating ripples across the single market and raising doubts that are not conducive to the progressive restructuring of the air-conditioning market - and the other markets in which these gases are used - so that they can be phased out over an appropriate and sensible period of time.
I hope the Commission can assure us that action will be taken.
We will act accordingly and keep the European Parliament informed.
Question No 38 by (H-0821/01):
Subject: Swedish ban on cadmium in fertiliser At the end of this year the Swedish ban on cadmium in fertilisers will expire.
The EU derogation will then run out and new arrangements cannot be prepared in time.
On its accession in 1995, Sweden was entitled to retain stricter rules than those applying in the EU for various chemicals and dangerous substances for four years.
The derogation for the Swedish restrictions on cadmium in fertiliser was extended by three years.
This time is up at the end of this year, and no new arrangements will be ready.
The purpose of the derogation for a limited period was that the EU would, in the mean time, tighten up its rules on dangerous substances.
This has been done in some cases, but not in respect of cadmium in fertilisers.
Pending common rules the stopgap solution must be to extend the derogation, which applies to Finland and Austria as well as Sweden.
But not even that will be possible before the end of the year.
The Commission proposal has yet to be submitted, and it then has to be adopted by the Council and Parliament.
This will mean that there will be a period during which high cadmium content fertiliser could theoretically be sold in Sweden.
Does the Commission consider that Sweden may continue to apply its own rules during this interim period?
On 14 September 2001 the Commission proposed the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to fertilisers in which the derogation permitting Austria, Finland and Sweden to maintain national limits on the level of cadmium in fertilisers is extended up to 31 December 2004.
This proposal is now in the hands of the Council and Parliament for the codecision procedure.
The issue of cadmium in fertilisers has been under study by the Commission for a number of years, originally with the aim of introducing appropriate harmonising legislation before the derogation expires on 31 December 2001.
However, due to the complexity of the scientific issues involved, and the delays in the risk assessments carried out by the Member States, it was not possible to propose the required legislation at an earlier stage.
For this reason, the Commission decided to extend the derogation on cadmium in fertilisers for a further three years and it did so by including the appropriate provisions in a proposal for a regulation recasting the existing fertiliser directives.
As the major part of the text of the proposed regulation is not new, it is hoped that this proposal will be adopted rapidly, possibly at first reading.
The Commission is doing everything possible to facilitate rapid adoption of the regulation.
But if it turns out that it is not possible to have the proposed regulation in place before the end of the year, the Member States concerned can ask for a derogation under Article 95(4) of the Treaty.
I would thank the Commission very much for its exhaustive and constructive answer.
I would also thank the Commission for its proposal to the effect that the derogation on cadmium in fertilisers should be extended.
This derogation is very important to Sweden and also to other countries.
I obtained the impression that the special derogation rule mentioned last in the answer means that we have a sort of guarantee against having to receive fertilisers containing cadmium for a possible interim period before the new extension comes into force.
Is this view correct?
I am very familiar with this issue because it was already important in 1993 in the negotiations on enlargement with Finland, Sweden and Austria.
If the Council and Parliament do not manage to adopt the proposed legislation in time, it is important for these three countries to request a derogation.
I believe that all the Member States are likely to be prepared to approve this quickly.
It is the Commission' s responsibility to check that EC legislation is implemented carefully. We have already produced a proposal.
We do not intend to take measures to cover only a specific short period of difficulties. I believe we can find a good way of dealing with this issue.
Thank you for all your replies, Mr Liikanen.
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 39 and 40 will be replied to in writing.
We now come to the last series of replies which will come from Mr Vitorino, on behalf of the Commission.
Questions to Mr Vitorino
Question No 41 by (H-0782/01):
Subject: Landing of large numbers of illegal immigrants in the Canary Islands What measures does the Commission intend to put forward to guarantee the integrity of Community waters around the Canary Islands, given the recent reports that motherships are being used to land large numbers of illegal immigrants from Africa on the Canaries?
The events referred to by the honourable Member demonstrate how important it is for the European Union to develop policies on preventing and combating illegal immigration and in particular irregular arrivals by sea.
Such policies need to be developed in partnership with the countries of origin and transit, and should also contain initiatives concerning the internal policies of the European Union.
The Commission is in favour of addressing migration in a comprehensive manner which implies that European Union policies should not only address illegal migration but also include initiatives to serve the socio-economic interests of countries of origin and transit as well as legal migration.
As regards the initiatives that need to be developed in partnership with the Mediterranean partners, it should be mentioned that illegal migration is one of the subjects currently being discussed within the framework of the Barcelona Process.
Both sides agree that multilateral efforts are needed to address illegal immigration from North Africa to the European Union.
The need to develop such a policy was underlined during the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs held in Brussels on 5-6 November this year.
This subject, including a number of concrete proposals on preventing and fighting illegal immigration, is also part of the draft regional programme on justice and home affairs.
Partners hope to adopt this programme during the next Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs to be held on 22-23 April 2002 in Spain.
Moreover, illegal immigration has been identified as one of the relevant themes for cooperation within the framework of the Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States and Morocco.
During the Association Council of 9 October this year Morocco underlined its determination to fight illegal migration and the networks of traffickers and called on the European Union for support in its efforts.
The Moroccan authorities have presented concrete and ambitious proposals which aim to curb illegal migration, primarily by reinforcing the surveillance of Morocco's Atlantic and Mediterranean borders.
The Commission is currently studying these proposals and hopes to be in a position to respond to the proposals fairly soon.
The Commission has also decided to use the newly-created budget line, aimed at cooperation with third countries in the area of migration, to support financial projects to assist the Moroccan authorities responsible for border control and the fight against illegal immigration by providing training and technical assistance.
Thank you, Mr Vitorino, for the information you have given me.
The problem we have today is that every week approximately 100 illegal immigrants are reaching the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura.
The operation seems to consist of getting hold of a supply ship from somewhere and than putting the immigrants onto small boats which take them to the coast.
Some make it, others drown, and the process goes on and on.
The Commissioner' s response is that there is no Community action, but that it is hoped that the neighbouring countries will control immigration.
But the fact is that this immigration is taking place.
My supplementary question is as follows: a couple of weeks ago, the Mayor of the city of Las Palmas bought 200 one-way air tickets for illegal immigrants who were there and they flew to Madrid.
The Mayor of Madrid, who is from the same party, was not very happy.
Does the Commissioner believe that, if this immigration continues in this way, this would be the way to proceed, i.e. that the Canarian local authorities should pay for one-way tickets for illegal immigrants, because there is no more space on the islands, or do you believe that there is another possible solution, which would not make this air link for immigrants between the Canaries and the European continent necessary?
Mr President, I believe there has been positive development since our last dialogue here in Parliament on this issue.
Firstly, the Barcelona process recognised the priority nature of the debate and dialogue on the joint strategy of the European Union and the Mediterranean countries for fighting illegal immigration, which is not an isolated issue, but which must be integrated into the overall negotiation of the socio-economic development of the Maghreb countries.
Secondly, in the bilateral relations between the European Union and Morocco, the Moroccan authorities have sent us very specific proposals to strengthen the control of the Atlantic and Mediterranean borders.
And I stress the Atlantic border because, as well as being an innovation in relations between the European Union and Morocco, it is particularly important for the specific situation of the Canary Islands.
These are two positive points in the dialogue between the European Union and the countries of this region, and specifically, Morocco.
The third point, which I believe is new, is that there is no European policy on returning illegal immigrants to countries of origin or transit.
Therefore, the Commission intends to present Council and the European Parliament with a communication in the coming weeks on illegal immigration, which includes the issue of creating common standards for the policy on returning illegal immigrants.
When we have this communication, the honourable Member will be able to see the Commission' s ideas and contributions to this debate on the creation of a European policy on returning illegal immigrants, which is currently the exclusive competence of national or regional governments, as in the case of the Government of the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands.
Question No 42 by (H-0792/01):
Subject: Inclusion of religion on new EU identity cards The recent terrorist attacks in the USA have given rise to intense debate over whether more detailed information about an individual's characteristics and origin should be included on identity cards in the Member States of the Union.
The Greek press reports that this issue will be discussed early next December in Brussels at the meeting of the Ministers of Justice, Internal Affairs and Public Order of the 15 Member States of the EU.
In the light of recent events, what is the Commission's view of including religion on the new identity cards to be introduced in the EU, as mentioned in the above reports?
Mr President, The European Commission has not submitted any proposal that seeks to have an individual' s religion included on his or her identity card.
In no Member State is the religion of an identity card holder mentioned on the card.
Lastly, the Republic of Greece has removed any mention of religion on identity cards and its initiative has been approved by the Greek Council of State, which considered that even the optional mention of religion on identity cards contravenes Article 13 of the Greek Constitution, which guarantees freedom of religion.
The Commission' s position with regard to the indication of religion on national identity cards has not changed.
We would ask the honourable Member to refer in particular to the answer the Commission gave to the oral question H-0456/00 by Mr Alavanos.
Such a measure would not only breach an individual' s right to freedom of religion, but could also lead to discrimination, whether overt or covert, on the grounds of religion.
Thank you Commissioner for your reply, but you did not answer my question as to whether the Ministers of Justice, Internal Affairs and Public Order of the fifteen are due to discuss the matter in their forthcoming meeting in Brussels.
That was my question.

My second comment is this: I absolutely agree on the sensitivity issue and, anyway, it is the common view in the European Parliament that the argument of religious identity should not be used as a factor which might cause problems if it is included; but I should like to ask if the European Union agrees that schools in the Member States of the European Union should do the same as the madrasses in Islamic countries and teach the view, and we see this on a daily basis, that Muslims should kill Christians and Jews and that this is a part of their religion.
I should like to ask, given that it is prohibited to teach Fascist or Nazi ideas about the annihilation of the Jews, if we can accept, on the contrary, that they be taught by Muslim fundamentalists in the light of the specific circumstances which have arisen following the attack on 11 September.
First of all, I have attempted to answer your question by saying that the Commission has not submitted any proposal on the matter.
This type of issue could not, therefore, be discussed at a Justice and Home Affairs Council on the basis of a Commission proposal.
As far as I am aware, nowhere on the agenda is a discussion scheduled on the issue that you raised at the meeting of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs of the European Union.
With regard to what I believe is your second question, the content of education provided by schools in Arab countries, if I have understood correctly, I must, of course, tell you that the Union has no competence at all to interfere in the content of school curricula of third countries.
Furthermore, even in schools within the European Union, as you are well aware, Mr Marinos, this falls within the sphere of subsidiarity, which means that it is within the exclusive competence of each Member State government to define the content of school lessons, both in state schools and in private schools, within the European Union.
Question No 43 by (H-0794/01):
Subject: Application of fundamentalist laws within the European Union With regard to a number of violations of women' s rights within the European Union justified by fundamentalism, is the Commission in favour of taking appropriate measures to prevent the implementation of laws incompatible with human rights?
Can the Commission accept that basic human rights are violated on the pretext of religious beliefs, cultural practices or customs?
What steps will it consider taking in the short and long term?
The breaches of women' s rights to which the honourable Member refers come in different forms and should be considered on an individual basis.
Nevertheless, the Commission notes that, in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, the Union is founded on the principles of freedom, democracy, and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the Rule of Law, principles shared by all Member States.
As confirmed at the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, in 1995, the promotion and protection of women' s rights are an integral part of universal human rights.
In no circumstances can the Commission accept the abuse of an individual' s fundamental rights under the guise of religious beliefs, cultural practices or customs.
This position is laid down by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (Articles 1, 4, 21, 23, 24) and by the other texts dealing with fundamental rights, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Articles 2 and 5 ) and the European Convention on Human Rights (Articles 2, 3 and 14). Item 18 of the Vienna Declaration, adopted in June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights, lays down that all forms of violence towards women, including those resulting from cultural prejudice, must be eliminated.
Regardless of national protection of fundamental rights and of women' s rights in particular, it should be noted that the Community has been working on a policy to promote equality between the sexes since 1975.
Equal access to the labour market, to governing bodies and to social rights are equally important rights in this respect, as well as the right to protection from violence and sexual harassment.
There is a raft of Community legislative measures, directives, and even case law from the Court of Justice, underpinned by a specific legal basis, Article 141 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Incidentally, Article 3 of this Treaty imposes the obligation of integrating concerns about equality between the sexes into all Union policies.
Thank you very much for your reply, Commissioner. It shows that the Commission has understood the problem.
As a supplementary question, I would like to know whether, in accordance with your reply, you foresee, or support the idea, that women immigrants should be informed of their rights within the European Union.
Could women immigrants be provided with services to defend their rights?
I would like to hear your opinion and whether you have any intentions in this respect.
I am very happy to reply.
I will begin by saying that all the initiatives presented by the Commission in the field of asylum and illegal immigration contain specific legal rules to deal with the very special situation of women immigrants or women seeking asylum or refuge in the countries of the European Union.
We have ensured that in the questioning relating to the granting of asylum there are specific conditions for dealing with the situation of women.
For example, women who have been victims of sexual abuse can ask for the official doing the questioning to be changed, so that it is a woman rather than a man, because that will perhaps make them more feel more comfortable when recounting the story their asylum application is based on.
The honourable Member has raised a very important issue: informing immigrants of their rights.
Unquestionably, one of the Commission' s concerns is that it should be possible to provide immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers with the fullest possible information about their rights.
I believe that if the honourable Member examines the Commission' s specific proposals to the Council and the European Parliament, both with regard to immigration and to asylum, she will see that the idea of information about rights is present.
It is the responsibility of the national authorities of the Member States, as well as the non-governmental organisations which we work with very closely in these areas, to provide complete and full information on the rights which immigrants seeking asylum in the European Union can benefit from.
As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 44 to 84 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.

Security of energy supply
The next item on the agenda is the report by Mr Chichester (A5-0363/2001) on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the Commission Green Paper 'Towards a European strategy for the security of energy supply' [COM(2000) 769 - C5-0145/2001 - 2001/2071(COS)].
Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the Commission on the Green Paper. It is an excellent analysis of our energy supply situation in Europe.
I thank all my colleagues for the way in which they have contributed to my report to bring it to this stage this evening.
There are three main points in the Green Paper.
Firstly, the European Union will become increasingly dependent on external energy sources, reaching 70% by 2003.
Secondly, the EU has very limited scope to influence energy supply conditions so that it is on the demand side that the EU can intervene, mostly through promoting energy saving in buildings and in the transport sector.
Thirdly, in present circumstances the EU is not in a position to respond to the challenge of climate change and to meet its commitments, notably under the Kyoto Protocol.
One thing above all else is staring us in the face: the massive dependence on oil and on imported oil in particular.
For commonsense reasons of security of supply and protection of the environment, urgent steps should be taken to address this disproportionate dependence.
We cannot alter the fact of where the oil comes from, but we can do a number of things on the demand side, particularly in the transport sector.
Being dependent on imports is not necessarily a bad thing or economically inefficient, provided that the sources are diverse, no one supplier is dominant and we can produce sufficient goods and services to pay for them.
The Commission is correct to focus on demand management measures as a first priority and it is to be hoped that the Member States will pursue this approach vigorously.
However I do not accept the view that little or nothing can be done on the supply side.
In four areas the EU and Member States can be masters of their own destiny and make a real difference, both to security of supply and to protection of the environment.
Renewable energy sources are by definition indigenous supplies and we are correct to seek to increase their share of final consumption and electricity generation.
However let us be realistic,.
Even if the ambitious targets for RES are met, they cannot be expected to replace any of the other energy sources completely or become the sole supplier of all our energy needs.
Nuclear energy is not popular in some quarters, but it supplies more electricity in Europe than any other energy source.
It provides large volume, base load power and produces hardly any greenhouse gas emissions.
It is a safe and secure European technology, operated under stringent standards of regulation.
To deliberately deny ourselves this major source of electricity seems perverse in the absence of an alternative source of supply that can provide an equivalent volume.
Coal is a source of energy in decline in Europe, because of cost and environmental concerns. Yet it is an important indigenous resource which could be given a new lease of life with new technology to make it more efficient and less pollutant.
Furthermore, there is huge scope for gaining business in the rest of the world for European suppliers of equipment and systems, if the industry can seize the opportunity.
The fourth area is research work for future technologies and energy systems.
That is something Europe must do in order to safeguard future security of supply, employment and technology.
It seems obvious but needs repeating.
For all the above reasons, I also disagree with the view that the EU cannot meet its Kyoto commitments.
What is needed is realism on the nuclear issue, determined effort on clean coal technology, much encouragement of RES and coordinated demand management measures, as well as a sustained effort to inform public opinion about the necessity to stop wasting energy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the Commissioner and the rapporteur because the Green Paper on the security of energy supply is a wonderful document which is accompanied by a great report.
This document represents the first great step in Europe' s energy strategy; it offers a global view of the situation and raises all the relevant issues in this sector without reservations or conditions.
It states that our main problem is our supply, characterised by great external dependence, which will increase over the coming decades.
We must not leave aside environmental issues, however, which are inseparable from energy use.
In this respect, the directive adopted on renewable energy sources and the proposal on the promotion of biofuels are going to lead to great progress in terms of the diversification of the supply of clean energy, but they are not the solution in either the short or medium terms.
We must not hinder any type of energy, above all if it does not produce CO2 emissions.
The solutions, as the Commission points out very well, involve the diversification of supply sources, especially clean sources - those which do not produce greenhouse gases.
We must insist on technological research into energy sources, energy saving and the liberalisation of the gas sectors, in order that we may create a genuine internal energy market.
Furthermore, it would be good if the Treaties could include a chapter on energy.
Mr President, I too wish to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Chichester, on the remarkable work he has achieved in analysing the issue and making a proposal and to say that I fully subscribe to his realistic and pragmatic approach, which maintains a crucial balance between the various sources of energy in implementing a European policy for energy supply.
This strategy is based on three complementary objectives, which I support: to reduce the European Union' s energy consumption by improving efficiency in certain sectors, particularly the construction and automobile industries; greater cooperation and investment for supplying countries, the diversification of energy resources with what I consider to be an essential objective: to reduce our dependency on oil.
I am also very pleased that this report explains how these objectives are to be achieved, namely by liberalising the energy sector, and I should like to reiterate the need not to give in to populist rhetoric, especially where renewable energies and nuclear energy are concerned.
We must remain realistic and understand that, without the contribution made by nuclear energy, the European Union will not be able to reach the objectives it has set for itself for reducing greenhouse gases.
Compliance with the Kyoto criteria must be one of the European Union' s priority objectives.
This is within our grasp if we demonstrate clear thinking in our choices and I also note that the options available in the field of taxation could prove to be powerful incentives, provided that they do not block the development of industry in the European Union.
Several amendments by the group of the Greens are counter-productive.
Instead of stimulating debate, they exclude from the outset various possibilities for energy choices and I feel they should be rejected so as to maintain the coherence of this report.
I hope that we shall do so, following the recommendations of our rapporteur.
Mr President, I like this report, and would like to congratulate the rapporteur on what he has said and, moreover, congratulate the Commission on its Green Paper, for, by it, the Commission is making us aware of our dependence on energy.
I can recall no debate in the past twenty years which has pointed out our dependence on imported energy in the way this Green Paper has.
Thank you again.
I would like to make two observations on nuclear energy.
Unlike many in my group, I take the view that it has a future.
I believe that we should also express that in a positive way.
Secondly, and this is perhaps even more important than the first point, I would like to observe that we have been given the task of developing a clean coal-fired power station.
I say this also with reference to our obligations as a result of Kyoto.
A clean coal-fired power station is not only of interest to Europe, but also to the world.
For let us not forget, as the Commission repeatedly emphasised, that in the next one or two generations, our dependence on fossil energy, at any rate worldwide, will be up to 80% and it is all the more important to master combustion technologies.
Mr President, I also wish to express my thanks to Mr Chichester, the rapporteur, for his significant work in preparing this matter.
As has already been stated here on previous occasions, the EU has only limited possibilities to interfere with the terms and conditions of energy supply.
Its chances of influencing the matter are restricted to the demand, and hence to the promotion of energy saving in the construction and transport industries.
The most important things, therefore, are to ensure the diversity of energy sources and an even distribution of suppliers of energy.
The availability of energy on a local level enhances the reliability of energy supplies, reduces dependence on imported energy and provides employment opportunities.
In particular, research into and the use of renewable energy sources must be promoted.
Responsibility for assuring the reliability of energy supplies is primarily a matter for national energy policies.
In order to enhance the reliability of supplies, it is also necessary to enter into agreements with other countries.
Also, energy projects that serve common European objectives are an excellent way of putting into specific terms the EU' s policies on the Northern Dimension.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my own position and that of the Greens have been discussed at length in other forums, and it is not possible, in two and a half minutes to present a detailed argument.
I shall, therefore, limit myself to asking the Commissioner a few questions.
First of all, it is important that this debate should be based on figures that are as precise as possible.
Even at an early stage of the debate, it was clear that the various scenarios available to the Commission are not really 'bottom up' scenarios, for energy efficiency, for renewables, or for cogeneration.
Furthermore, another problem is that, often, European scenarios do not correspond to the detailed scenarios drawn up by Member States.
In this context, I should like to know whether the Commission has begun working on this type of scenario with a view to the Barcelona Summit.
Secondly, energy efficiency is everyone' s birthright and everyone is insisting on this point.
What is the Commission' s view today, in concrete terms, on the important actions to be taken in the field of energy efficiency?
Parliament has put forward a number of alternatives, both in its Energy Intelligent Europe initiative, and in the action plan.
Nevertheless, since October, I have not seen the Commission making a genuine, sustained effort on this matter.
Thirdly, and this is a fundamental point, at the beginning of your presentation of the Green Paper, you promised us a real democratic debate.
Today, however, I see that the national round tables have not been entirely transparent and that, at European level, we are still waiting for an open and transparent debate to be held, something that you announced at the beginning as being a key element.
This is why I am asking you today, Commissioner, when will the round tables take place in civil society, amongst experts at European level?
We have been hearing about them for the last six months, and we have yet to see one take place.
I fail to see how the Commission can ensure that the Green Paper is followed up without organising these round tables.
Mr President, we are all aware that the European Union is highly dependent on external energy sources and has very limited scope to influence energy supply conditions.
That does not mean, however, that the European Union should not do more to promote the use of alternative energies and safer and cleaner energies.
It must also play a leading role in ensuring that all the conditions of the Kyoto Protocol are implemented.
The broader international community has not covered itself in glory in the efforts to ensure that the depletion of the ozone layer is stopped.
This report refers to the fact that nuclear energy in Europe will be playing a less significant role, following the decisions by five Member States to phase out the use of nuclear energy in the future.
It also states that no country in Europe is currently constructing new nuclear reactors.
It would be greatly appreciated in Ireland if you would inform the British Government and BNFL of this fact.
The British Government is currently planning the expansion, not a reduction, of nuclear activities at Sellafield.
The MOX facility at Sellafield means more nuclear reprocessing, not less, and nobody in the British Government and BNFL can deny this.
In Ireland we are sick and tired of BNFL breaching so-called high standards of regulation in their nuclear operations.
We cannot easily forget that BNFL falsified documents in relation to nuclear reprocessing contracts with the Japanese Government.
Where are the stringent standards of regulation, when you are dealing with a company that has falsified documents and has been shown time and time again to operate its affairs in this very slipshod manner?
I believe that BNFL is technically insolvent.
Its liabilities for cleaning up after the closure of nuclear plants and the disposal of nuclear waste will be up to GBP 34 billion, while it has GBP 235m worth of shareholders' funds on its balance sheet.
What is the economic justification for the continuation of the Sellafield nuclear plant, let alone the expansion of its nuclear operations in the future?
Are the British people fully aware of the extent of movements of nuclear materials by rail and sea in Britain?
In Ireland we are very concerned about the security arrangements at Sellafield in the light of the terrorist attacks in America on 11 September.
What assurances can the British Government give the people of Ireland that maximum security operates in the region?
We know the type of devastation that would occur if a twin towers type attack were to take place at Sellafield.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Green Paper on the security of energy supply is fundamentally to be welcomed.
It deals with an acute problem, one directly linked with the world political situation, which is more extensively unpredictable than ever.
Despite the very large number of good statements, I cannot share the rapporteur's view that nuclear energy is a practical alternative to energy imports.
The reasons are well known.
Only recently, a study was completed, commissioned by Parliament, which comes to the conclusion that the reprocessing plants at La Hague and Sellafield discharge as much radioactivity over seven years as was emitted in the Chernobyl nuclear accident.
The problem of the ultimate disposal of radioactive waste has not been resolved.
Nor does nuclear fusion offer a solution.
It therefore makes more sense to invest in safe and renewable energy sources than in nuclear fusion, which can achieve results in 100 years at best.
Mr President, if a good policy consists of producing complete and correct diagnoses and drawing up and implementing the corresponding solutions, there is no doubt that the Commissions' energy policy, promoted by Commissioner de Palacio, is an example of a good policy.
Within this good policy, the Green Paper provides a detailed and consistent analysis of the situation.
The Green Paper provides four fundamental messages: the message that there is excessive risk associated with dependence on external sources beyond a reasonable limit; the message that it will be impossible to comply with the Kyoto objectives if we remain bogged down in inertia and do not introduce corrective measures; the message that we have little room for manoeuvre in terms of supply policies and we must concentrate our efforts on demand policies; and the message that we need to provide our energy policy with a genuinely European dimension.
There is no doubt that this good policy goes further than diagnosis, because the Commission demonstrates that analysis and action can be simultaneous; and in Parliament at the moment we have the directive on the energy efficiency of buildings, the directive on transport, the directive on the liberalisation of the gas and electricity market and the regulation on cross-border exchanges of electricity.
For all these reasons, we must congratulate the Commissioner and I will not end without also expressly congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Chichester, on his well-considered report and his receptiveness to the work of his colleagues.
Mr President, honourable colleagues, I praise the part of the report where this gas pipeline link with Russia has been incorporated in the Northern Dimension.
Honourable Member of the Commission, I propose that the Commission take swift measures in order to get this northern gas to balance our energy situation.
A great deal of attention in this presentation has been given to lignite.
I should like to ask, therefore, why peat, although it renews itself by a millimetre every year, has been completely forgotten; but then, peat is a type of vegetation found in poorer areas, while lignite is found in wealthier ones!
Nevertheless, peat is an important fuel component in remote areas, and it is also a regional fuel.
Forty per cent of all energy is spent in buildings, to heat them, to provide water, air-conditioning and lighting for them.
Already, during the previous energy crisis, we in Finland had to make modifications to buildings and we have managed to achieve good results in severe conditions.
We must greatly enhance energy efficiency in buildings because that is where there really is a great deal of room for improvement.
We shall have to gradually get accustomed to twilight conditions, for example.
It is great to live in semi-darkness and not always in the sunshine, in artificial light.
Mr President, successive petrol crises and the political and social fragility of the main oil-producing countries demonstrate the importance for our economies of the concept of self-sufficiency in energy.
Unless we show a solid political will to implement this self-sufficiency, our future lies in the direction of energy dependency.
If we allow things to continue the way they are, in 25 years' time, the European Union' s dependency on external sources of energy will reach 70% rather than the 50% we have today.
This realisation is what underlies the Green Paper.
If we wish to remain masters of our destiny, we must give priority to action on two fronts.
We must, on the one hand, encourage energy savings wherever possible. On the other hand, we must make good use of our advantages, our skills and our resources.
With this in mind, and as the Green Paper and our rapporteur suggest, in a realistic rather than an ideological way, we should address the issue of developing nuclear energy.
This would require acknowledging that this form of energy cannot be faulted in terms of creating greenhouse gases but also that intensive research efforts are absolutely crucial if we are to make waste end products completely harmless, even if they only exist in low volumes.
Blaming reprocessing processes, as the WISE report, commissioned by the STOA and of highly dubious scientific merit, has done once again, will not help us find a solution.
Instead of allowing their technological lead to stagnate, the European countries should capitalise on it, particularly by focusing their research on improving reprocessing and recycling techniques.
The same research effort must be made in the field of biofuels, which have the merit of representing a major indigenous source of energy for us: these are non-polluting and offer promising outlets for our farming.
I am sorry that the Green Paper has not given this matter sufficient prominence.
Mr President, here we are, all worried about our dependence on imported fuels and energy, worried about the future of our economy and our jobs, and yet we have Mr Fitzsimons and Mr Kronberger bemoaning and belittling one of the main potential sources for meeting that problem, the nuclear energy solution.
Not only does it meet our energy and economic requirements, but it also meets our environmental requirements under Kyoto.
I would say - and Mr Chichester's excellent report bears this out - that unless we diversify our sources of supply of energy, especially by promoting indigenous supplies of energy, we will be in trouble with our economy and our jobs in the future.
Nuclear energy must play a significant part in both those ambitions: diversification and indigenous supplies.
There are other areas as well.
Mr Chichester mentioned coal.
We must promote clean technologies in coal.
In my part of the world, in Scotland, we would like to see more emphasis on promoting the oil and gas industries and their potential for better recovery systems, for exploration in marginal areas, for developing marginal oil and gas fields, for replenishing the reserves, the reservoirs in the south part of the North Sea, with gas in the meantime to protect us for the long term, and particularly transmission systems.
That applies not only to oil and gas but also to electricity.
In all these areas there is great potential for research.
That ties us into what we will discuss tomorrow in the Caudron report on the Sixth Framework Programme.
In all these areas, diversification, indigenous supplies and research will help us to meet our objectives.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wished to speak in this evening' s debate for two reasons.
First of all, I too wish to reiterate the importance of energy for Europe at a time when it is predicted that we will be 70% dependent on external energy sources in 2030 with clearly very little room for manoeuvre.
Next I wish to stress that I entirely support the approach of Mr Chichester, who is proposing both a diversification of energy sources and the development of all current sources without exception.
These proposals do, of course, make calls for liberalisation that I would probably have rejected had they appeared in isolation.
They are presented today, however, in a very broad range of demands, some of which are extremely bold and that is why I am able to support the package put forward by Mr Chichester, whom I wish to compliment on his report.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to express much thanks to Mr Chichester.
Very rarely have I seen reports on energy of this calibre.
The Commission Green Paper was already first-rate, but with this supplement I believe we have many sound building blocks for the EU' s energy policy.
The greatest concern, of course, is, as Mr Chichester rightly points out, our energy dependence and the question 'what can be done about it?'
In my view, therefore, the well-balanced package in the Chichester report offers an excellent helping hand.
That means that one should not only consider natural oil and gas supplies, but also new forms of energy.
That one should consider renewable energy sources, but that one should not immediately rule out nuclear energy. Certainly with regard to the way in which its use can be made safer.
That is certainly feasible, and a great deal needs to be done yet.
One cannot say that nuclear energy is no longer acceptable, for then one gets into the greatest difficulty in Europe.
Something must also be done about those aspects which give rise to questions, of course, and on that score too, a great deal can be done, partly by finding intelligent solutions.
It has been said time and again: if there is no energy chapter, then nothing can be done.
Well, if I read Paragraph 21, which merely sums up all elements of the EU policy that can be achieved at the moment, that is an enormous agenda.
On that score, our Commissioner has a great deal of work to do.
Energy and geopolitical developments are closely related, particularly if we consider the developments after 11 September.
I therefore hope that the energy charter will be ratified at the earliest opportunity and that we will further develop the Caspian Sea Basin, for in that way, we can also slightly reduce Europe' s dependence.
I should like to finish off by congratulating both the Commissioner and our rapporteur on their sterling work.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Chichester, and congratulating him warmly on the quality of his work and his efforts to produce a truly remarkable report.
I am aware of the scale of this challenge, given both the size and complexity of the issue itself and the number and diversity of the parties affected by it, inside and outside Parliament.
When I speak of the security of energy supply, I am not just referring to the physical supply, but also to energy systems and services which are ecologically, socially and economically sustainable.
In this respect, the security of energy supplies is essential to our development and security in the broadest sense, and recent events have demonstrated this even more clearly.
In fact, the tragic events of 11 September have highlighted our dependency on imports and the security of our installations.
The risk factor has multiplied overnight: the risk of premeditated damage to installations and infrastructures, the risk of volatility on the oil markets (with its prejudicial effect on the world economy) and the risk of interruption to our supply, both internal and external.
All of this means that it is more important than ever to provide appropriate measures for responding in the event of emergency.
It is encouraging to note from the responses to the Green Paper - more than 150 formal responses from different organisations of all types - the interest in issues relating to the security of energy supply throughout Europe and beyond.
I am pleased that the Commission' s analysis has received general support and that there is a considerable degree of awareness of the risks and problems faced by Europe in terms of guaranteeing the security of the energy supply and the international nature of those risks and problems.
This is reflected in the excellent report you have before you.
Many respondents have accepted that it is no longer possible to view energy supply as being independent from economic and environmental objectives.
Furthermore, a series of points in the report confirm that the European Parliament has clearly understood that there is a close link between these three objectives and the balance between them must be maintained.
The responses also confirm that European public opinion shares the Commission' s desire to confront the problem of climate change.
I am pleased to see that the European Parliament not only shares this concern, but that it has many ideas on the instruments which may help us to achieve this objective.
We will carefully study these ideas when we prepare our response to the consultation on the Green Paper.
I am not going to refer to it at the moment, but I would like to state very clearly, ladies and gentlemen, that the issue has given rise to debates in numerous national Parliaments, in some of which either I or high level officials from the Commission have participated, and in various universities, companies and non-governmental organisations, thanks, amongst other things, to the use of the Internet, which is a vehicle for openness within society, which, although not yet concluded, gives us an idea of the importance of this issue in all social fields of the European Union.
I am especially pleased to highlight the insistence on energy efficiency.
Like you, I believe that there are huge areas for possible improvements.
Your ideas are clear, in relation to the supply, in the context of the general recognition that there should be diversification of energy sources and supply origins.
As the report accepts, no individual source is completely lacking in drawbacks: they all have a cost and they all seem necessary.
With regard to coal, we have no alternative but to maintain basically subsidised production, at least for a certain amount of time.
In any event, the Commission' s proposed regulation confirms the importance we attach to own-production, but, above all, the importance of developing clean coal technology, which will allow us to use the only ample reserve of fossil fuel that the European Union has and promote the possibility of improving and reducing emissions internationally.
In this way, furthermore, we will maintain cutting-edge technology which offers all sorts of possibilities for our industry.
With regard to renewable energy sources, their importance will depend on the speed with which we can overcome a whole series of technical, social and economic obstacles.
The renewable energies directive, in relation to electricity, offers a guide for the direction we should take.
I know that we have been criticised for not making sufficient progress with this directive, but we are still trying to achieve our objective of doubling the percentage of renewable energy sources by the end of this decade.
In this respect, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to the previous intervention by Mr Souchet, we approved a few days ago an important and ambitious proposal on biofuels, which I hope will be approved and supported both by the Council and by Parliament.
With regard to nuclear energy, I am very satisfied with the frank and constructive exchange of views which the presentation of the Green Paper has made possible.
Some Member States have announced a moratorium or the progressive dismantling of their capacity for nuclear generation.
But one Member State has clearly stated its intention to go ahead with nuclear energy and to build a new reactor.
In any event, the abandonment of nuclear energy by some Member States may make a significant hole in our energy capacity and speed up the use of forms of energy generation which emit more greenhouse gases and, therefore, create problems in terms of our Kyoto commitments.
Although I have total respect for the decisions taken by the Member States, naturally, I believe that in these circumstances it is very difficult to confront the problem of climate change if we maintain a diversified energy base.
I believe that it is advisable to keep all the options open while the research into the management and elimination of waste is intensified and that is essentially the greatest problem with nuclear energy, given the progress made in terms of the safety of nuclear plants.
The debate on the Green Paper is still open.
It is therefore premature to anticipate its final conclusions.
However, the Commission is continuing, and will continue, to make proposals in the quest for new perspectives on energy supply.
We are working with you and the Council on the internal market legislation relating to one of the pillars of our strategy, in terms of both gas and electricity.
We must continue looking into the tax framework and pricing and, specifically, the guarantee of a mechanism for setting energy prices which reflects all the quantifiable external social and environmental costs.
Also in this field, we will shortly present certain energy network interconnections which will further integrate the national markets and therefore strengthen the security of the whole market resulting from this integration.
Furthermore, I hope soon to present a proposal on the combined generation of heat and electricity, which will allow us to make progress in the battle for efficiency.
Somebody said earlier that we have done little.
But I would remind you, ladies and gentlemen, of a proposal on buildings, which is very important (buildings represent 40% of energy consumption, and there are margins for savings of almost 20%), the proposal we will present to improve the current regulation on combined generation of heat and electricity, and a general proposal, a framework proposal, which will provide measures for all types of electrodomestic or electrical equipment within buildings.
With regard to demand, the benefits of energy saving which have been raised are clear and, I insist, we have presented many serious, solid and important initiatives, and we are going to present those which I have just mentioned.
With regard to transport and its effect on demand, the Commission makes a very detailed analysis in the White Paper, of which I have mentioned some important aspects when I spoke about the proposal on biofuels which was approved last week.
The report also clearly recognises the international nature of the challenges relating to energy supply.
The increase in our dependency, not only on oil, but also on gas, makes it essential that we study the broader geopolitical repercussions of the current market situation.
The Commission intends to produce a report on this issue next year; of course, we would like to use the opportunities offered by the Sixth research and development framework programme and the successor to the energy framework programme as instruments for supporting our strategy.
Ladies and gentlemen, the security of the energy supply is an inextricable element of a balanced social and economic development.
The debate on the Green Paper has highlighted, as never before, the delicate interrelationship between energy needs, environmental objectives and balanced economic development.
Many of the ideas presented in this report may be important elements in guaranteeing the security of our energy supply.
As I have explained, some of them have already been implemented, but they are not yet a defined strategy.
Europe needs to establish a stable long-term framework to guarantee the security of energy supply, which can deal with changes in international economic and environmental circumstances, and which creates a firm basis for the future role of Europe on the international stage.
Bearing this in mind, I would like to use the European Council in Barcelona next spring as a launch pad for a European strategy on energy supply, and you can rest assured that, in drawing up this strategy, the ideas contained in this report will be taken into account.
I hope to have further opportunities to debate this idea with you.
I would like to congratulate Mr Chichester once again on his wonderful report and the work he has done.
I also congratulate and thank Mrs Ayuso for her opinion on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and I thank everybody who has spoken on this report and this debate.
I promise that we will continue working on it when the conclusions closing the general debate on the Green Paper produced by the Commission are finally presented.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Mr Turmes, on a point of order.
I asked the Commissioner two very specific questions and I am rather disappointed that she has not managed to give me an answer.
One question concerned possible scenarios and the other concerned round tables.
Sir, that may well be the case, but that is not a point of order.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Chemicals strategy
The next item on the agenda is the report (A5-0356/2001) by Mrs Schörling on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the Commission White Paper on Strategy for a future Chemicals Policy [COM(2001) 88 - C5-0258/2001 - 2001/2118(COS)].

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the strategy for the future chemicals policy, which we are to discuss and adopt positions on in this debate, is extremely urgent and important because it will form the basis for a draft legislative text and for new framework legislation for the EU' s chemicals policy.
Gratifyingly enough, the European Council decided, at the Gothenburg Summit in June, that a new chemicals policy would have to be introduced by 2004 at the latest and that this time limit would have to be respected.
The Commission must therefore table its draft legislation in the course of 2002.
The debate on deficiencies in the current chemicals policy has been going on for quite some time.
Among the criticisms made is the fact that there has been a lack of information about the majority of the 100 000 existing chemicals, that the work has proceeded far too slowly and that the present policy has, in practice, failed to protect human health and the environment.
The Commission' s survey of the legislation on existing substances shows that human beings and the environment are potentially exposed to a large number of chemical substances whose dangerous characteristics are not known.
We know that the human body contains measurable quantities of 350 chemicals. We also know that the quantity of brominated flame retardants in breast milk has been increasing each year.
Even if PCB and DDT are now surrounded by tough restrictions, it remains the case that high quantities of these chemicals are still found in the fatty tissue of human beings and animals throughout the world, even in the Polar regions where these chemicals have not been produced at all.
New chemicals are added to the list, for example PFOS or perfluorooctane sulfonate, which does not bind in fatty tissue but, rather, in blood protein. These chemicals are found in a number of products, for example shampoo.
Through the regulation adopted by the Council in order to overcome the deficiencies, detailed risk assessments should be carried out and recommendations made as to measures, etc. which might be taken. We now know that there are only 140 chemicals on the 'priority list' and that risk assessments have been completed in only eleven cases.
Even worse is the fact that not a single measure has been decided upon in order to reduce the risks, in spite of its having been shown that such measures are needed for the majority of these substances.
The Commission' s White Paper, produced by the Environment and Enterprise Directorates-General, is trying to create a high degree of health and environmental protection, at the same time as maintaining the competitiveness of the European chemicals industry.
This is done, for example, by saying that chemicals policy must stimulate technical innovation and the development of safer chemicals.
In common with the majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I believe that the strategy should be focused on the protection of the environment and of human health and that the point of departure for the Commission' s White Paper should be the debate in the Council and the growing unease about the fact that current chemicals policy cannot offer adequate protection of the environment and of human health.
Naturally, the economic and social aspects must be accorded a fair degree of importance as parts of a strategy for sustainable development.
If a majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy voted for a proposal that goes further than the Commission' s and shows how an effective, open and consumer-friendly control of chemicals should look in the future, that is completely in line with, and receives strong political support from, the European Council Summit in June when the conclusions drawn by the 15 Member States were significantly stricter and more far-reaching than the Commission' s proposal.
There is therefore an express political will to adopt the policy for a new chemicals strategy proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, above all when it comes to the scope of the REACH system.
As currently desired by the industry and the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, only CMR 1 and 2 and POPs are to be included which, in that case, cannot be said to be much in the way of a strategy for the future.
Even among industrial companies there is a desire to go further, for a competitive industry cannot be achieved through the unacceptable situation we have at present but only by producing safer chemicals and chemicals that protect human health and the environment.
I therefore believe that we should stick to the compromise achieved between the various political groups and to the proposal backed by the majority.
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 11 October the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market adopted my opinion on the White Paper on Strategy for a future Chemicals Policy.
Harmonisation of chemicals policy across the EU is especially important, but the following three aspects are no less significant.
First, the practicability of the registration system.
The amount of data to be collected means we must keep a sense of proportion in order that the system is not congested from the start.
The principle of proportionality is also to be applied to the required definition of use, so that the manufacturer of a product must be able to restrict the definition to actually intended purposes.
Secondly, a clear definition of the substitution principle.
The definition of this principle varies from one Member State to another, if they have one at all.
If it is to be laid down in Community law, it will have to be formulated in a consistent and unambiguous way.
Thirdly, appropriate protection for test data.
Insufficient account is taken of the need to guard commercial confidentiality.
At the same time, the security data document should be under copyright in order to protect the applicant against misuse of the data obtained.
Mrs Schörling's report is to that extent unbalanced.
It takes too little account of the interests of medium-sized chemical businesses and of the industry as a whole, something that can lead to distortions in competition.
I therefore recommend adoption of the amendments resulting from the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which contribute to a better balance of the interests of all interested parties.
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
(DE) Mr President, the Commission's White Paper has the ambitious intention of comprehensively modernising EU law on materials and products.
It is fundamentally right to unite, in legal terms, old and new materials and combine them with standardised registration and evaluation procedures for all materials over one tonne per annum in a strict time concept by 2012.
This fundamental line taken by the White Paper strengthens sole responsibility for chemicals management in the industry and takes past experience with individual items of legislation as the basis for proposing a comprehensive reorientation.
Parliament's Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has adopted this report by a large majority.
The consequences of the White Paper's proposals for competitiveness, international trade, employment and medium-sized businesses had not previously been sufficiently examined, and further studies are still required.
In addition, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy expressed the view that legislation should be made to apply not to the attributes of materials but only to actual, scientifically verifiable risks.
Amounts are merely auxiliary quantities.
What is crucial is the amount of risk involved.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy therefore demands a two-stage screening process.
We expressly reject the following suggestions made by the rapporteur of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy: that sensitising substances be included in the approval procedure; that approval be granted only for a limited period; that the registration requirement should apply to all amounts under one tonne; that the public be given unrestricted access to all data; that there should be extensive prohibitions on materials; that extensive data and evaluations to be submitted by the industry should be subject to additional examination by peer review; and a number of other points.
A massive extension of the approval procedure would run quite counter to our common goal of reducing animal experiments.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy therefore takes a rational line, as demanded by both trades unions and employers in the European chemical industry.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, chemical substances and products are a part of our daily life today.
To a large extent, we could not manage in our society without them.
For example, we use cleaning materials, cosmetics, plastics, medicines and much more besides, almost without thinking about it.
It is though, equally self-evident that we must know what effects the use of these substances and products has on our health and our environment, and so we need a practical and flexible system to monitor and evaluate existing substances and those materials that may be created in the future.
The Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats takes the view that the White Paper must do away with the inadequacy of European chemical policy and give first priority to protecting human beings and the environment, as well as to sustainable development, without thereby jeopardising the competitiveness of the chemical industry and of SME's in the global market.
The chemical industry is the third largest processing industry in Europe, and, according to the Commission's figures, provides 4.7 million jobs in almost 40 000 firms, most of them small and medium-sized enterprises.
With this report, we are deciding on their future.
The Schörling report clearly focuses on the ecological dimension, and there are grounds for concern that the excessive demands, on the authorities as well, will paralyse the whole system and condemn it to failure from the outset.
We in the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats therefore cannot go along with the obligatory registration of materials of which less than one tonne is produced per annum; the extension of the approval procedure; the substitution and prohibition of substances only on the grounds of their characteristics; an additional peer review process; impracticable duties of notification and databases.
It is our opinion that only a balanced system can ensure the production of high-value products within the European Union, the safeguarding of jobs in it, and the improved protection of people and the environment.
Mr President, I welcome the Commission proposal on chemical policy.
It is long overdue.
For too long we have seen a gradual increase in allergenic reactions and even worse human health effects and at the same time a series of undesirable effects on the general environment.
If we adopt this report, we will be taking a first step towards asking a very important question: whether the 30 000 chemicals in general use today and the 100 000 components that they are used to make are in any way responsible for the things we see happening to human health and the world around us.
There is no doubt that we will have to make a very wide-ranging examination of the chemicals in use today and those that we might want to introduce into our environment in the future.
We will have to start considering issues and areas that we have not previously considered.
Socio-economic issues will be particularly important.
The full effects of changing our chemicals policy and strategy will be wide-ranging across the whole of Europe.
However, one would hope that, by taking a serious step forward tonight and starting to formulate a new structure for chemicals policy, we will arrive at a policy which is truly sustainable in the long term; which brings genuine and positive benefits to society as a whole; ends any negative impacts upon human health in the environment and stands as a shining example to other parts of the world as to how they should progress in future.
So tonight we are taking a step not just towards a cleaner and better European environment and a stronger and more prosperous chemical industry in Europe but also towards a healthier and better future for the whole world.
Mr President, I hope the Commissioner has caught up on her sleep after another succesful climate change conference.
It all seemed very easy when the Commissioner first put the plan to us.
She said that we use tens of thousands of chemicals in Europe.
They are essential to our way of life but there is very little public information about them and the real fear is that some of them may be causing long-term damage to the environment and human health.
So we must get the information, we must carry out the tests and, while keeping the good and maintaining a strong European chemicals industry, we must identify the bad and weed them out.
But that was a few months ago.
In the meantime all of us have learnt a great deal from the lobbyists about the difficulties of putting the policy into practice, as is well illustrated by the difficulty of identifying even the number of chemicals we are talking about.
Sometimes we hear of 30 000, sometimes of 100 000 - quite a big difference.
At least the chemical industry says it is in favour and supports the Commission's objectives, but it warns that the proposals are impractical, will increase bureaucracy and will be immensely costly.
The testing regime, it says, will cause paralysis of the whole system, especially if we extend the requirements.
Millions of animals will be killed painfully and perhaps unnecessarily in order to meet the testing requirements.
All these concerns need to be taken into account.
When the draft directive comes before us, I will be listening very carefully to industry's complaints.
I recognise that in environmental matters we often hear industry crying wolf, but even so we must ensure that new requirements placed upon the companies are realistic and practical and that they enhance rather than damage a very important business.
This is only a White Paper. In making recommendations, I support Mrs Schörling in asking the Commission to strengthen its environmental commitments, rather than relax them.
But in reality we will probably end up following the Council of Ministers in passing the buck back to the Commission, asking you to find a way around the obstacle course and giving an absolute guarantee that we will criticise you, whatever proposals you come up with.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report is a milestone for environmental and consumer protection, areas in which chemical policy to date has completely failed.
Hundreds of thousands of chemicals have been on the market for decades and we do not know in what quantities they are available and what risks they present.
It is as if the precautionary principle was trodden underfoot; these chemicals were, without controls, tested on us and on the environment.
Amounts totalling under 1 000 tonnes per annum are not even notifiable, regardless of the dangers involved.
We have, then, for decades been playing Russian roulette with our health and with the environment.
We must put an end to this frightening, indeed irresponsible, situation as soon as possible.
If the industry does not put the data on the table within a specified period of time, these chemicals will no longer be allowed to be put on the market.
I hope the majority in this House will not allow itself to be made the lackey of the chemical industry, for the aggressive advertising of the German chemical industry in accusatory mode has clearly shown it to be too helpless and incapable of presenting valid arguments at a political level.
Complaints about shop closures, raised even by Members of this House, are a positive joke in view of the way the chemical industry, while increasing production in real terms by 25% over the past ten years, brought about a reduction of 14% in its workforce - without a chemical policy along the lines proposed by the White Paper, and we know all too well that the chemical industry only has the chance to offer long-term employment if it offers for sale products that do not harm the environment.
Only then can the chemical industry's position be strengthened.
We will fight for the new chemical policy as the central point of European policy on the environment.
I believe this is about putting an end to decades of the 'ostrich with its head in the sand' policy and implementing a chemical policy which is effective and has a future, a policy which puts health interests and the precautionary principle in first place.
Mr President, the EU' s chemicals policy requires a thorough renovation and a single, new and comprehensive set of regulations.
Mrs Schörling' s report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which we are now discussing, provides an excellent point of departure for a new chemicals policy.
With this report as a basis, the Commission should quickly be able to table proposals for a new directive.
The strength of the report is that it really puts the environment and public health first, and that must be our main task.
We also believe that industry has a lot to gain from strict regulations in as much as they encourage modern manufacturers, promote innovation and mean that old chemicals that have not been investigated are no longer promoted, as they are in fact at present.
The following points in the report are especially important to our group. Firstly, the proposal as to which chemicals are to be included under the requirements for registration, evaluation and authorisation should be made more comprehensive, as proposed.
Secondly, tough requirements should be made of chemicals, and of products containing chemicals, when these are imported.
Thirdly, everything must be done to minimise the number of animal experiments.
Fourthly, the substitution principle should be made a crucial component of chemicals policy.
Great importance should be attached to this so that safer alternatives will always be sought.
Fifthly, use of the most hazardous chemicals of all should be considerably restricted.
Our group is pleased with the committee' s proposals.
We nonetheless have some minor amendments we believe could further strengthen the report.
We wish to emphasise the demand that it should be those departments of the Commission with responsibility for environmental protection that should approve new chemicals.
It is also a question of further tightening up the requirements made of the most hazardous chemicals of all.
In the committee, the rapporteur chose a very sound and open method of working which gave all the political groups the opportunity to compromise at an early stage, and I think that that is something positive.
Mr President, it is high time the chemicals strategy were reviewed, for only 11 of the 140 substances on the priority list have been assessed to date.
However, we should take care, in our enthusiasm, not to bite off more than we can chew.
Of course, I too would welcome a complete overhaul, but in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the Commission has already warned that if the chemical substances policy is overloaded, the ship will sink.
That seems to me reason enough to remove some of the cargo from the ship.
In concrete terms, I mean that the substances below one tonne should remain outside the scope of the new policy for the time being.
Furthermore, the ship is reeling from side to side, swaying from a stringent policy on the one hand to the wish to take generous account of social and economic effects on the other.
This half-heartedness can be avoided by prioritising the most harmful substances.
In that way, the benefits for the environment and public health will be the greatest, and the social and economic effects on industry will automatically be contained.
We therefore no longer need to pull the wool over the eyes of industry by positing that the new policy will improve innovation and businesses' competitive edge.
Finally, I am of the opinion that the generally recognised criteria for harmfulness, namely dosage and use, need to be maintained.
Mr President, the principles underlying the strategy for a future EU policy on chemical substances, namely to ensure a high level of protection for human health and the environment while ensuring the efficient functioning of the internal market and stimulating innovation and competitiveness in the chemical industry, receive my unqualified support.
However, I am struggling with the White Paper and also with Mrs Schörling' s report, because I believe that the White Paper is not effective on a number of scores.
Although Mrs Schörling has worked hard, she too is complicating matters.
Let me therefore give a few examples of a system which, in my view, could function.
I know that the Commissioner too has been informed by the Dutch government about where industry initially refused point blank to adopt the new system entitled SOMS. However, industry and the government are now very happy with this system.
Allow me to give you a few examples and in doing so, expose a few weaknesses in the White Paper.
First of all, the industry' s responsibility. Lip service is being paid to this, for the White Paper is limited to risk assessment data and to providing information to downstream users.
Responsibility should really be placed with industry, and that means, therefore, that it must also be able to take risk-restricting measures off its own bat.
The entire system proposed by you, including heavy-handed interference from the powers that be, has proven that it does not work. That is why a change is needed.
Secondly, the reach system should be modified.
In any case, a possibility for rapid screening must be introduced.
Rapid screening can also be done on the basis of a harmfulness profile, for the tonnage is not a determining factor.
My fellow MEPs and I have tried to include these provisions in amendments, and I hope that at least Amendments Nos 102 and 103 will be adopted accordingly.
Mr President, Europe needs a new strategy for dealing with the issues surrounding chemicals.
We are concerned here with the health of all of us, as well as with that of future generations.
The Commission' s White Paper is a good point of departure for continued work on the strategy.
Mrs Schörling' s report creates good conditions for bringing about necessary changes.
It is exceptionally important that Parliament adopt the report in such a form that it have the same thrust given to it by the rapporteur.
In the debate that took place while the report was coming to fruition, many objections expressed the fear that stricter regulations would put jobs and economic development at risk.
That is an anxiety which must, of course, be taken entirely seriously but, at the same time, it is necessary to raise one' s sights and look beyond jobs and the economy.
Economic growth and access to jobs can never be invoked to prevent necessary requirements concerning the use of chemicals, work on achieving sustainable development and a high level of protection of public health and of employees.
What is the use of jobs and a sound economy if we poison our countryside and destroy what is essential for future generations?
We have only one earth and we must take care of it.
We often say that we have the earth on loan from our children.
If we are to be able to hand it over in good condition, it is high time that we modified our way of life.
It is in a number of capacities that, as human beings, we are affected by the ways in which chemicals are used.
We are affected as employees and as consumers, and we are affected by persistent and bioaccumulative substances which can give rise to hypersensitivity, hormone changes, cancer etc.
The regulations which now have to be devised must, in the first place, be aimed at protecting individual people and not, as now, companies' interest in making profits.
A society characterised by sustainable development also provides lasting employment, a sustainable living environment and people able to have faith in the future.
In that way, a better world can be created.
Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that the European Union must, with the passing of time, equip itself with a new chemical policy.
The one we have at present is unsatisfactory.
There had been advance indications that there would be a vast array of tests, but the overall test result is unsatisfactory.
The Commission's principled involvement is therefore to be welcomed even if we cannot support every aspect of its proposal.
There is, though, something of which I must warn you. You, too, Commissioner, are on my mind today in particular.
When you introduced yourself to us, you announced that the experience of your own country led you to want to establish a new policy on chemicals in Europe.
My impression is that today, like Goethe's Faust, you have conjured up something you cannot control.
What the rapporteur, Mrs Schörling, has presented is not a proposal about environmental policy.
It is a classic export of pollution, as many enterprises that are already being marginalised by the European Union will move themselves very quickly even nearer to its boundary and indeed also outside the EU in order to save themselves these unimaginable impositions.
This cannot be a modern environmental policy.
Rather, we must take this branch of industry with us in integrating high but feasible standards.
I believe that the aspects already mentioned - temporary approval, obligatory regulation under 1000 kilos, the principle of substitution and regulation of use as well - are an attempt at multiple protection, for every owner of a medium-sized business is being enslaved, because only industry can now meet the obligations which your proposal envisages.
I believe that this proposal should be sent back to the Commission, but certainly not to the rapporteur, whom I otherwise greatly respect and who, on this occasion, has thoroughly disappointed me.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, particularly my colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats, let me beg you, as a matter of urgency: can we please turn it down a bit?
This is about a White Paper, and I believe we should not be trying to engage in muscle contests, which are in one way or another politically motivated, on the basis of this White Paper.
At some future point we will be having the legislation, when we can do the real fine-tuning.
It is a pity that some of the earlier speakers are no longer here; they will not hear what I have to say.
But perhaps someone will be able to tell them.
We have submitted amendments with the very same things in mind, which state that the duplication of work is to be avoided.
Amendment No 97 is to remove peer review in order to simplify the procedure.
We have already in committee brought in submissions on behalf of medium-sized businesses to the effect that there should be pilot projects, in which medium-sized businesses could deal with registration simply and effectively.
We want simple administrative regulations and have provided for the employees, who will be directly affected - the employees and the members of the European works councils - to be involved in the decision-making process.
These demands have been met, and I do not know why this all has to be played up and why the fate of the chemical industry has to be dependent on it.
We are dealing here with a White Paper, in which nothing is finally decided.
I cannot understand it.
We have also included a subparagraph relating to substitution principle, which states that substitutes, too, have to be subjected to complete life cycle analysis before they can be used.
So if we do not accept that and say, 'that is the way to do it' then I do not know what we are supposed to do next.
And this one tonne: I simply cannot understand the argument that substances under one tonne are intrinsically less dangerous than substances over one tonne.
Even they should be registered.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the enormous amount of work she has done, but I do not congratulate her on the content of the report.
Mr Lange, I know we are talking about a White Paper, but this White Paper sketches a mere initial outline of our views, and when we in the PPE-DE express our opinions, we like our subsequent actions to be consistent with them.
It is no good saying one thing now and then doing the opposite when the time comes to legislate.
Let this be clear: this is a major sector of industry, the leading sector or one of the leading sectors in Europe. This sector employs millions of people and includes tens of thousands of small businesses.
However, it is also a sector that is causing concern in society because there are 100 000 unknown chemicals being used, and it is therefore right that we should respond to this concern.
That is why we consider the Commission' s proposal and the White Paper to be a good starting point, in that it gives us a procedure, a goal and targets to achieve.
We welcome the industry' s willingness to bear the cost of this operation of sifting the good chemicals from the bad and providing information.
However, what we do not support is the unnecessary expansion, the complicated procedures of expansion, the extension to too vast a range of substances, the use of scientific grounds which are too vague as the basis for forming opinions, which is what the Schörling report advocates.
This, ladies and gentlemen, not only harms the chemical industry but also jeopardises the environmental objective we have set ourselves.
As the Romans used to say, 'The best is the enemy of the good' .
Let us steer clear of such at times populist, at times fundamentalist attitudes, for our shared, common objective of protecting health and the environment in a sustainable economy against precisely an excess of, so to speak, overexhaustive initiatives, is in jeopardy.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to welcome the White Paper.
In reality, we are aware of the effects upon the environment and public health of only a very small proportion of the hundred thousand chemicals that exist.
I think it is a serious problem for the EU' s environmental and public health policies that a combined strategy for chemicals policy was not implemented many years ago. Now, however, it has arrived as something I very much welcome.
I should also like to thank Mrs Schörling for an outstanding report which tightens up the Commission' s proposal in some crucial ways, ways which, in my opinion, could well be adopted without changes.
That is not, however, going to happen.
The industry, and others, have also made their influence felt here in Parliament, and the result we shall adopt tomorrow will not be quite as good as it might have been.
I should like to point out some of the substantial improvements contributed by Parliament.
We are having a very great deal of emphasis placed upon the precautionary and substitution principles.
This constitutes a reversal of the burden of proof.
With what is also the Commission' s point of departure, we are now acquiring a stricter system - with, importantly in my view, some clear deadlines - for regulating, phasing out and authorising chemicals.
It is also important that we should have an extended list of hazardous substances that are to be phased out.
Finally, I should also like to highlight the issue of animal experiments.
I think that, in this area, a very important contribution has been made, including by the Liberals, to getting the issue of restricting animal experiments onto the agenda. That is something I am very pleased to be able to support, including in the vote tomorrow.
There are many substantial advances which ought to be included in the forthcoming legislation, and I shall therefore merely ask the Commissioner, finally, when the Commission' s proposal for joint legislation is to be tabled?
I understood it was to have been early next year, but it would be splendid if we could have a fairly clear date made known in this House today.
Mr President, I too appreciate the work of the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on a genuinely advanced strategy.
Parliament is thereby making a major contribution, applying the approach of sustainable development in all its inseparable dimensions, environmental, social and economic, to the chemical industry.
In this report, protecting the environment and safeguarding human health go hand in hand and it is intended to maintain the competitiveness of the chemical industry through incentives to support innovation and facilitate the gradual replacement of the most hazardous substances.
Other improvements can be included tomorrow if we adopt the amendments tabled by Mr Lange and other Members, benefiting smaller business, in particular.
This is a prevention strategy, then, and not just a strategy of acting in retrospect, when the damage has already been done, but it is also a strict, rigorous strategy.
That is why the reference to environmental responsibility must be accorded due importance. This is a principle which must also be recognised as important in those countries in which safeguarding health and safety in the workplace and protecting the environment are not always given due consideration.
I refer to the recent decision which failed to condemn the Porto Marghera petrochemical plant and let the directors of Montedison Enimont get off scot-free, even though they were responsible for the death of 157 workers and the disastrous pollution of the Venice lagoon and the surrounding land, a decision against which the Italian government should appeal.
Mr President, we need to be clear that chemicals can be good for you.
You only have to look around this chamber at the carpets, chairs, desks, paint, steel and glass to see how much we depend on them.
However they can also be bad for you.
Some insecticides, flame retardants and even hair sprays can be a danger and we need to be wary of them.
Chemicals can certainly present a risk if they are mishandled and they can need regulation.
Sometimes they need to be phased out or banned.
However, I fear this report goes too far too fast and so, in some respects, does the White Paper.
I know it is only the White Paper stage, but we need to look carefully at some of the potential costs, said to be some EUR 8bn to European industry.
A massive cost to animals has been referred to.
The BUAV estimates 2 123 animals per high production volume chemical test.
We are told that 12.8 million would be at risk if one were testing on 30 000 substances and the report goes up to 100 000.
Of course not all those would need animal tests, but a substantial number would.
One other example of how this report overreacts: paragraph 38 sweeps up all CMR category 3 substances and designates them of very high concern.
Just take one example from one industry, the raw materials for flexible foam.
The finished product is in no way a hazard and provides comfort and safety for consumers in products from furniture to car dashboards.
That is an industry employing 360 000 people, 96% of them in small- and medium-sized firms.
They could be at risk.
The aims of the White Paper are right: we want to improve knowledge about chemicals and we want a safer world.
We should prioritise areas for action.
That means rigorous management of risk, without damaging unnecessarily the many small- and medium-sized firms that make up the chemical industry which has its risks but also brings jobs, benefits and safety for our citizens.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are apparently all in agreement, for I notice that even the PPE-DE believes that the current chemical policy is characterised by a lack of substance, too much bureaucracy, powerlessness to acquire knowledge about all substances and also the incapacity to take measures.
That is why support for the White Paper is so important, but even more so, support for the improvements which are being proposed in the Schörling report.
Pressure from the chemical industry has been enormous, particularly in the last few days.
Apparently, it does not lack the necessary financial resources to set up big campaigns and to portray a large majority of this Parliament as a bunch of eco-fundamentalists.
But I believe that the outcome of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was balanced and that it therefore deserves every backing tomorrow.
I should like to mention a few essential points.
I am of the opinion that, in the long term, all substances will need to be registered, but that in the medium- and short-term, priorities will need to be set; the latter, however, not simply on the basis of production volumes.
Smaller volumes too must also be granted sufficient attention, and the starting point should really be the intrinsic characteristics of a substance.
As Mr Bernd Lange stated a moment ago, the substitution principle is essential. If a less dangerous substance is available and tested, what logical reasons do we then have not to use it, other than perhaps financial considerations?
A second essential element is that we must be able to ban substances of high concern, such as persistent and bioaccumulative substances and endocrine disrupters, unless they are essential from a social point of view and no alternatives are available. We should then be able to authorise them under strict licensing.
Last but not least, maximum consumer information must be provided via clear labelling, but also via publicly accessible databases and information on the substances.
Mr President, I too voted in favour of the Langen report in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and believe I was right to do so.
On the other hand, I also understand how our colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy put a different emphasis on things.
That, too, I consider understandable, for otherwise we would not need both committees and could do everything in one.
I also take the view that it is only this tension between the various committees that makes it possible for something sensible to emerge at the end of the day.
I will be quite frank in saying that I have a number of difficulties with the Schörling report.
The main one is perhaps that I believe substances should be evaluated not only according to the danger they may present, but also according to their characteristics.
In this sense, they are not simply capable of being substituted for each other, at least not all of them.
There are substances that are dangerous, but which are useful in certain chemical processes.
Secondly, I believe that whether or not a substance is dangerous has to be founded on scientific statements.
It must be verifiable.
I am always very dubious about suspicions of danger or risk.
Being very subjective, these can be understood but not verified.
The vast number of testers required leads me to ask where they all are.
Safety does not increase in line with the amount of hyphenation or the number of regulations, but is increased by actual testing.
So we will have to look into that.
And one more little observation: which substances are actually necessary to society?
How does one ascertain something like that?
Who ascertains something like that?
I still need some clarification on that point, but I am happy to listen.
I would, by the way, like to remind the President that, this evening, we are discussing over EUR 800 billion in turnover, 400 billion of it in energy and 400 billion in chemistry.
That is a hell of a lot for two and a half hours.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank the European Parliament for the report on the Commission' s White Paper on a future chemicals policy.
I really do hope that it will be adopted tomorrow. It is incredibly important that we should take this step towards a new, better and more effective chemicals policy.
I want to say a special thank-you to Mrs Schörling, who has put a great deal of work into her role as rapporteur.
I also want to thank all those who have taken part in the debate, because it has been an important discussion in which important points of view have emerged.
The White Paper presents the Commission' s proposal for a new chemicals strategy.
The modes of procedure presented in the White Paper are well balanced, and I believe they involve a step forwards in the direction of sustainable development.
The debate in this House has perhaps shown that we have succeeded reasonably well in finding a balance between different views, even though there is scope for improvements.
The background is as follows.
Chemical production has increased almost explosively, from 1 million tonnes in 1930 to 400 million tonnes per year today.
We wish to maintain a high level of protection for the environment and human health, but we also need to try to make use of the advantages presented by chemicals.
We all know that there are chemicals in practically all the products we encounter every day.
It would be unrealistic to believe that, with a wave of the hand, we could get rid of all chemicals or that there could be a chemical-free modern society.
However, we must balance these requirements.
Anyone who examined what is now the European Union' s 20 year-old system of supervision would see clearly that it is not effective enough by a long chalk. I would maintain that the system makes, for example, an artificial or arbitrary distinction between old and new chemicals.
Chemicals have many extremely important advantages for society.
Thanks to medicines and pharmaceutical products, it is possible to combat illnesses and suffering.
It is probably the case that a majority of the products forming part of our modern life-style today are manufactured from plastic or contain chemicals of some kind.
The chemicals industry is one of Europe' s largest manufacturing industries, employing 1.7 million people.
Between three and four million jobs depend upon it.
Ninety-six per cent of all companies are small and medium-sized, and they account for approximately 23 per cent of chemicals production.
We are all of us exposed to chemicals on a daily basis.
We have tried to look into whether this situation can be described in figures.
Calculated, for example, in tonnes, each and every one of us probably comes into contact with several tonnes of chemicals in our daily life. That should also mean that we are exposed to several tens of thousands of chemicals.
More and more reports are coming in concerning health problems, allergies and asthma assumed to be connected with chemicals.
As has already been mentioned, research results show that the human body can contain at least 350 synthetic chemicals which, in the natural course of things, ought not to be there.
There are persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals, and these are now to be found in placentas, foetuses and new-born children, to which they are transferred.
These chemicals are the first things a child ingests.
Chemicals are found in the depths of the sea and in the Arctic, where they have never once been used.
Hormone-changing substances can affect our reproduction and our nervous systems.
That is a fact.
The procedures governing the present EU legislation have been rightly criticised for being too slow and unwieldy.
Even though we have made some progress within the EU when it comes to evaluating the risks and restricting and controlling the use of hazardous chemicals, there is still an incredible amount to do.
At present, it is the authorities who have to demonstrate that a chemical is unsafe. That obviously has to change.
As in the case of all other products, responsibility for ensuring that products released onto the market are safe must lie with producers, manufacturers and users at later stages in the manufacturing chain. That, basically, is what EU legislation will amount to.
Can you think of any other product about whose content we do not even have basic information or for which responsibility is entirely assumed by the authorities?
That is a basic error in the system.
What we now have to do is find a suitable balance between, on the one hand, the chemicals' advantages and, on the other hand, the unacceptable risks they involve for human health and the environment.
At the same time, we naturally want to ensure that the internal market is able to function and that the European chemicals industry, which is the world' s largest, can maintain its competitiveness.
In order better to be able to assess the consequences of different ways of implementing the proposals in the White Paper, we have set up an inquiry which will look more closely into the costs.
The Commission proposes that a 'REACH system' be set up to cover both existing substances, many of which have been on the market for at least 20 years but have never been properly tested, and new substances released onto the market after 1981.
The industry must be given incentives to gather data and, if need be, test the substances, preferably without using animal experiments.
We must help one another ensure that animal experiments are restricted. An integrated policy is needed in order to do this.
None of us, I trust, would happily see full-scale experiments carried out on living human beings, animals or the countryside involving chemicals whose contents we do not know enough about.
There is, in actual fact, no denying that that is what happens at present, because we do not know enough about the chemicals that are released.
Pragmatic decisions are required in this area, together with a sensible application of the precautionary principle to chemicals policy.
If there are reasons for suspecting that a substance has damaging effects on health or the environment and if our scientific and technical knowledge is not sufficient to provide a clear appreciation of the risks, we must take no chances and restrict or prohibit the use of the substance until such time as we know more.
The absolute top priority is to fill the gaps in our knowledge of the risks involved in the 30 000 'existing substances' that are produced or imported in quantities greater than that of one tonne per manufacturer per year.
The proposed new system includes a special arrangement for substances that give cause for special concern, or what are known as CMR substances. These are substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction.
They must be authorised before they are allowed to be used, and companies must show that they can be used safely on condition that risk management measures are taken.
It should then be possible to authorise such safe use with reference to the cost and income analyses supplied by the companies.
In this way, the burden of proof will be redistributed, and the risk assessment will be focused on those areas of use for which the companies have sought authorisation.
In this way, approximately 1 500 substances, that is to say 5 per cent of all substances, will be covered by this authorisation procedure.
The system will promote innovation, and that will lead to the most hazardous substances being replaced.
I note that, in its draft report, Parliament proposes that several categories of substance be added to the authorisation procedure.
I can appreciate its wanting to do that, but I believe that, as matters stand, it would be inappropriate to accord the system too much scope.
We must be pragmatic to start with, so that we do not relapse into having an unmanageable system.
If we overload the system, a large number of resources will be employed in managing a very small portion of all those substances that need to be investigated.
We have limited resources, and we must establish priorities and decide how we are to use our resources in the most effective ways.
Parliament' s draft report also says that the proposed EU system must cover chemicals produced in quantities of less than one tonne in the form of substances or preparations that occur in products.
On the part of the Commission, I want most definitely to recommend a limit of one tonne so that it is possible to use the resources of the industry and of the authorities in the most effective way possible.
If we want to get the proposal through, we must concentrate on what is most hazardous.
There is no doubt a misunderstanding here.
This limit does not apply to the most hazardous substances which, in each and every case, must go through the authorisation procedure.
The very fact that the limit is set at one tonne does not mean that chemicals produced in smaller quantities escape monitoring.
The industry is still obliged to carry out a risk assessment of the chemicals and to provide safety information to users in the form of marking and Safety Data Sheets.
It is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure that these provisions are complied with.
The industry must be able, upon request, to supply information to the authorities.
The Commission has now set up a number of technical working parties with experts from the Member States, industry, non-governmental organisations and the Commission.
The result of their deliberations is expected in February 2002, and it will constitute one of the most important contributions to the draft legislation on the part of the Commission.
It is difficult to prophesy when the Commission will be able to table its proposals.
If everything goes smoothly, I believe that we can aim for April or May 2002, but the objective is, no matter what, to submit the proposals to Parliament and the Council before the summer of 2002.
Finally, I want to say a few words about the debate which I know is taking place and which is perhaps being conducted most eagerly in Germany and the United Kingdom.
What matters is that the European chemicals industry should remain competitive, but we are doing nothing that is not also being done in the United States, Canada and Japan within the framework of the OECD.
Roughly the same measures are also being taken by our competitor countries and in the world around us, where precisely the same problems are being experienced as in Europe.
If the desire is for the European chemicals industry to hold its own, sustainable development must be worked for.
It must be possible to guarantee that what is produced is safe for use in terms of human health and the environment and that it corresponds to the requirements of consumers.
We have tabled a balanced proposal which takes account of the needs of industry but which also states that what is most important is to bring about a high level of protection for human health and the environment.
I think the best answer that can be given is to say that there is no need to be anxious. This proposal will lead to innovation in the chemicals sphere.
We can defend our European chemicals industry through the safe use of chemicals in the future.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Pricing policies for enhancing the sustainability of water resources
The next item on the agenda is the Report (A5-0341/2001) by Mrs Flemming on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the Commission communication to the Council [COM(2000) 477 - C5-0634/2000 - 2000/2298(COS)], the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee on pricing policies for enhancing the sustainability of water resources.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are dealing here not with a legislative procedure, nor with a White or Green Paper, but exclusively with the implementation of Article 9 of the framework directive on water, which very precisely indicates how the costs of water services are to be covered.
By 2010 at the latest, the Member States have to ensure that their policy on water charges offers appropriate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently, and that it takes into account the social, ecological and economic effects of covering the costs and the geographical and climatic conditions of the region in question.
I have therefore attempted to make it clear in my report that the exploitability of our water resources must be maintained, for future generations as well, that we must keep to proven ways of keeping water pure and providing the population with clean drinking water, but that we may also look into new ways of doing this.
In doing this, universal supply and drainage, high environmental standards, quality of provision and affordable prices must all be safeguarded.
It should be possible to introduce business instruments and involve private enterprise, but also achieve proportionate optimisation of the operational structures involved in providing water supplies.
I myself say an emphatic 'No' to the deregulation of water supply and drainage, but I say 'Yes' to every country being able to use its water in the way that the people want.
I say 'Yes' to solidarity in water use within Europe, but this must not be invoked to force any Member State to make its water available to another Member State without charge.
On the subject of the many amendments that have been proposed, I would just like to say briefly one thing: It is marvellous to repeat things that are important, and also to repeat them over and over again.
It is also very difficult to speak against things that are right and important, especially if they have long been part of legislation and of a directive, such as the water framework directive.
But the question arises of how suitable it is to proceed in this way.
Since we are today only drawing up guidelines rather than legislating, I would say: so what?
One amendment really hurts me - the one which, as it were, condemns a certain Member State because of a project which really is purely an internal matter for that State and the environmental effects of which have not yet been assessed and in respect of which, as and when European Union funds are actually granted, the laws of the European Union will of course have to be abided by.
If I may establish a disagreeable precedent, I would be very happy if this amendment were perhaps to be voted down.
I found the Commission document very good.
I also think it a good thing that Parliament, in contrast to the practice in many Member States, can also be heard on the subject of a law's implementing regulation.
I would like to hope that the Commission and the Council will find their efforts supported by Parliament's opinion.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate both the committee responsible and Mrs Flemming for the work they have done.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development welcomes the communication from the Commission.
A suitable pricing policy for irrigation water will play a fundamental role in encouraging more efficient and sustainable use of water in agriculture, its largest consumer, and will free up resources for other uses, thereby reducing environmental pressures.
The analysis of the pricing of irrigation water is complex, due to the wide range of agricultural uses in the European Union and also regional differences in the need and availability of water for agricultural usage.
Water is, essentially, the very backbone of the agricultural community in the Mediterranean regions.
Without water, nothing grows, apart from the controversial almond trees.
The pricing policy should be heterogeneous, taking into account the 'polluter pays' principle, as well as the social, environmental, economic, geographical and climatic variations in regions that no doubt will be the most affected by this pricing policy.
The financial, environmental and resource costs of irrigation farming require differential treatment if gradual-recovery objectives are to be achieved.
For this reason, the introduction of this policy should be progressive, transparent and must be adapted to local requirements.
In this way, information to irrigation farmers and the adaptation and optimisation of infrastructures and irrigation techniques should be applied in parallel so that farmers can accept this policy.
Ladies and gentlemen, in its current form the CAP does not help to achieve the objectives set out in the framework directive, which means we must seek coherence between these two policies in order to guarantee the protection of European agriculture' s functional model.
Today, in Europe, water is a factor for cohesion between countries.
The revision of Agenda 2000 on the development of agri-environmental measures should include the objectives of water policies.
This will require the revision of certain types of aid, the application of eco-conditionality and the recognition of the right to adequate compensation for more vulnerable farmers, such as those who work on family holdings, with the aim of promoting the sustainable use of water and an integrated rural development.
Mr President, the price of water is a factor that has an undeniable effect on its consumption. However, the subject should be broached with appropriate caution, so as not to give rise to counter-productive effects of an economic and environmental nature.
The great disparity in the application of criteria in this area should be taken into account, as well as the barriers that can exist in Member States, both of a legal nature and with regard to acquired rights and customs, that can be difficult to amend, particularly in the short term.
On this subject, it is interesting to note that there are certain crops that contribute to the survival of a habitat and fauna that, without these crops, would disappear.
There are also industries today that, after using a certain quantity of water, return it to its source in the same or even in a better state than before they used it.
In principle, it does not seem a good idea to place a burden on this type of activity.
If time permitted, I could continue to give examples of economic activities, both agricultural and industrial, that, far from posing a threat to our water resources, are clearly beneficial to the environment.
Lastly, Mr President, financial resources gained from water-pricing policies should be used to improve infrastructures, which would prevent water loss in transport, for example, and would ensure better and increased access to this resource.
Paying for the amount of water we consume is, indeed, a key element, but only one of the many measures that should lead to a more rational use of this vital resource in all Member States.
I believe, Mr President, that this important issue of water distribution can be relatively easily solved if we have the good will and solidarity of EU governments.
Mr President, water is the Number One food.
I therefore consider constant use of water and protection of water resources to be indispensable.
One means by which this may be achieved is, as required by the water framework directive, a price for water that covers costs, comprising the environmental costs and the cost of infrastructure and of treatment.
Incentives are necessary for water to be continuously used.
Careful use of water is encouraged by having a basic price for basic services and increasing prices for use over and above that.
The basic price must also take social aspects into account, for access to water must be possible for the less well off in society.
One important area in which there is a need for action is that of agriculture.
The reduction of water subsidies in agriculture and the careful use of water resources will only be achieved by promoting rural development and finding new sources of income for farmers.
Water polluters must also be called to account, which means that the 'polluter pays' principle applies.
Every water consumer in Europe should additionally receive a statement of how much water he has used and how the price he pays for his water is made up.
I see it as an important question, how much of a market we permit and whether private commitment conflicts with public and regionally-organised water supply and careful use of water.
I believe that cooperation between public and private undertakings using private know-how and capital is an option when it comes to making the best use of water resources from an ecological and economic point of view, without regional supply zones being given up.
So here I am not talking about deregulation and competition at any price, but about ensuring efficient and environmentally friendly water supply.
Mr President, Mrs Flemming's report builds on the existing water framework directive.
My group is happy to support it.
If water resources are to be used sustainably, the price of water to users must reflect both the costs of delivery and the costs of subsequent treatment.
But when we vote tomorrow, a great deal of attention will be focused on just one aspect of the report, the Spanish hydrological scheme to build 120 dams and transfer vast quantities of water from one river basin to another.
I am not sure that a report about general principles should single out any one Member State for criticism but, having listened over the past few weeks to both sides of the debate, my personal view is that this scheme seems to be the antithesis of the approach laid down in Mrs Flemming's report.
The Commissioner has made very clear in the past her personal opposition to the use of EU structural funds to support projects which are damaging to the environment.
So I hope she will watching closely when the Spanish Government comes to the Commission seeking billions of pounds in structural fund support for a project which seems to me to directly contravene the principles if not the letter of the water framework directive, one of the Commission's greatest achievements.
I expect the Commission to make it absolutely clear that environmental impact studies must be independent and must consider the entire scheme, not just individual proposals.
This Spanish scheme is set to become a test case of whether the Commission's commitments toward environmental sustainability are matched by a determination to stand up to pressure from vested interests and the governments of Member States.
I hope that the Commissioner will do her best to make sure that her colleagues pass that test.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mrs Fleming on her excellent report, which is better than the Lienemann report on the water framework directive.
The Flemming report deals with water prices and, as Chris Davids has already stated, particularly relates to one very controversial issue, Paragraph 28, in which concern is expressed about the plan by the Aznar government to tap a vast quantity of the northern Spanish river, the Ebro, and to transport this water 1 000 km to southern Spain to cater partly for the tourist industry and partly for agriculture.
This plan is detrimental to hundreds of nature reserves in Spain and will also adversely affect the natural habitat of the brown bear and Iberian wolf in the Pyrenees.
This gigantic plan will cost EUR 22 billion and Spain wants Europe to contribute EUR 7 billion.
Spain should learn that water is a precious commodity and that clean water comes at a price. That is why hotels and farmers use it sparingly.
This is standard practice in northern Europe.
It is also striking that the Portuguese government - Portugal is, after all, also on the Iberian Peninsula, does pursue a sound water price policy.
Under pressure from the Aznar government, a new Amendment No 6 has been tabled by Messrs Flemming, Cox and Davis, precisely to delete reference to this Spanish plan.
Does Pat Cox' application for presidency have anything to do with this by any chance?
How else can it be explained that the liberal group is now all of a sudden adopting a different position from that which it adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Fellow Members, I urge you to vote against Amendment No 6 to the Flemming report and to vote for the original paragraph.
Mr President, as my fellow Members have stated, water is a limited natural resource that citizens have a fundamental right to access and use.
We cannot, therefore, support the amendments that talk of water as being a commodity or those which talk about the private management of water.
And we will be voting against these amendments.
However, I do believe that the rational use of water is an absolute necessity, as stated in Mrs Flemming' s report, and also a moral responsibility for Europeans with regard to those populations that have an enormous water deficit.
Article 9 of the framework directive which, as the Commissioner knows very well, required a great deal of time and discussion time to complete, provides for the recovery of costs.
The same directive, however, and the report by Mrs Flemming, as other speakers have mentioned, state that different regional, social and climatological situations should be taken into account, which leads on to the need to adopt water-saving measures in order to prevent leaks from water production and distribution systems, and to ensure the maximum re-usage of purified water, as well as the improvement of irrigation techniques.
In order to achieve this, the public, and those who work in the three sectors affected: domestic, agricultural and industrial, need to be informed.
The quality and purity of water must also be improved.
Commissioner, there is still a high level of nitrates in water and this should be addressed, as we have always said in the European Parliament.
I would like to finish, Mr President, by saying that it is hardly surprising that, in the context in which we are speaking, there should be clear opposition to the Spanish National Hydrological Plan, approved, it is true, by a majority in the Spanish Parliament, for it is based principally on the use of reservoirs and the transfer of water in rivers such as the Ebro that could have a disastrous effect on an ecosystem that is unique in Europe.
Furthermore, the planned reservoirs are located in Special Protection Areas.
For this reason, it must be said, Commissioner, that, without wishing to condemn my own country in particular, we must pay more attention to how European funds are used.
Mr President, water is not a commodity and the right to water remains a fundamental one.
On the other hand, the Member States must set a number of objectives for themselves to ensure the proper management of water.
In this context, a comparison between States could lead to the use of best practices.
States must, however, maintain control over pricing and regulation.
A community pricing system would create many problems. How can we reconcile the interests of the countries of the north with those of the south?
As for regulation, the local water committees, for example, the main consultative and administrative bodies in France, should not be undermined.
Similarly, it makes sense for water policy to take account of specific geographical and regional characteristics. Water needs differ according to the type of agricultural production, soil quality and climate.
Like the Commission, the rapporteur questions the application of the 'polluter-pays' principle to the agricultural sector.
This pricing policy would lead to a substantial increase in price per cubic metre, an additional cost that would be added to the cost of animal welfare.
Changing crop-growing techniques would put farmers in a risky and insecure situation.
Regulating water in too dramatic a way would penalise farming, which has already made huge efforts towards making refunds.
Farming is in crisis and will have to stretch itself even further to comply with the rules of the WTO, which is now meeting in Doha.
Instead, preserving the multifunctional character of our farming, which contributes to land-use planning and to managing the environment, will enable us to achieve better water quality.
Legislating now would be a mistake.
Let us wait for the CAP reforms before we adopt a global approach to the issue of water, listening to and consulting all parties involved.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the communication from the Commission shows that they are giving thought to how to put into practice the requirements of the water framework directive, and Mrs Flemming's report makes valuable additional suggestions.
Average household water consumption varies, per person per day, between 120 litres in Belgium and 213 litres in Italy.
Germany, with DM 7.72 per cubic metre for the supply of drinking water and for wastewater drainage, is, with Denmark, far and away at the top of the world league, but, as regards consumption, is third from the bottom.
Adequate high-quality water supply and appropriate drainage are part, of course, of services of general interest in the broadest sense, such as we have been discussing this morning.
We must not, though, make the mistake of lumping deregulation and privatisation together.
Privatisation can, in conjunction with other means, be perfectly adequate in achieving the objectives set by Article 9 of the water framework directive.
I would, though, at this point, like - in the context of the discussion on the subject-matter for the new Inter-Governmental Conference - to give a clear reminder of the topic of the demarcation of competencies.
We should not be making the sensitive area of water supply and drainage even more unstable while this issue has not been satisfactorily resolved.
The various aspects of water and the price paid for it are among the most politically sensitive issues in some Member States, not only the southern ones, but also for Ireland and Austria, for example.
I would wish to emphatically warn against mentioning or even attacking individual Member States.
This applies all the more in view of the attempt, for example in item 28 for obvious reasons of party politics, to realise demands at a European level which would not be feasible in terms of domestic policy.
Additionally in this case, the issues addressed are, then, only very marginally concerned, if at all, with the subject of the report.
We would be creating a precedent with unforeseeable consequences, and I urge the adoption of Amendments Nos 3 and 6, for otherwise we would have to vote against an otherwise very good report.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of this report was to propose a text describing the effects of water pricing on consumption.
Some Members, however, found the temptation to include proposals on the prospects for privatisation in this sector too strong to resist.
To my mind, privatisation is often the first step towards liberalisation.
Some of us in this House support the idea that water must not become a commodity like any other and must instead be given special consideration and above all remain the property of everyone, in present and future generations.
Public authorities must remain in control of the distribution and treatment of water, even if we accept the idea of delegating services to private companies for set periods and under precisely defined conditions.
Above all, if we wish to involve Europe' s citizens in these issues and to ensure that our policy does not simply result in higher bills, let us work on informing and communicating with the public on this crucial matter.
We must win over as many people as possible to our concerns if we are to directly encourage individuals to reduce their water consumption.
Mr President, the report works on the basic assumption that the easily-accessible fresh water reserves have been largely opened up, that long-term water use and savings can be achieved by using economic leverage, and that this would promote the responsible use of water.
This requirement can only be met on a world-wide basis.
I do not see implementation of the report's objectives on pricing as the high road that we should be taking.
Affordable prices are often saddled with negative associations.
The cost of clean water depends on the right investments, on technical skill and on better success than hitherto in allocating tasks in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle.
The Member States are free to come to their own decisions.
It will be difficult to keep to the timetable.
Mr President, as has been said, this debate is directly related to the debate we held before the entry into force of the European Parliament and Council Directive establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy.
The report before us captures the spirit of the directive and applies it directly to the issue of the cost to be paid, by all users, although maybe not in equal amounts, for using water for economic purposes.
However, the report also, rightly, and here I congratulate the rapporteur, stipulates that access to water at a proportionate or reduced cost, according to need, is a human right.
Therefore, any pricing policy must be based, above all, on a realistic examination of the social and other conditions in which the commodity of water is to be used, but also on a user education campaign that raises awareness and particularly focuses on water saving measures.
In order to provide a service which best responds to the different situations, it would be appropriate to incorporate the principle of subsidiarity so that each State makes its own decisions and each region sets its own levels and parameters.
The general line taken by this report could be described as preventing wastage and assisting the less economically developed areas, and our thoughts therefore turn immediately to the matter of the agricultural world, which, as some of the Members have pointed out, must certainly not be too casually confused with the general issue.
The basic principle is, in fact, that all the users should, in any case, contribute to paying for the commodity of water but in different proportions.
However, priority scales also need to be established on the basis of first social and then economic requirements.
The most direct comparison is with the CAP, which is intended to encourage and propose development measures which, as well as being suitable for the area concerned, are also compatible with the level of water resources available. Where there is no water available at all, Mr President, I feel that this needs to be taken into account, especially in the pricing policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the report' s assertion that water is not a commodity, but rather a heritage that must be protected, defended and treated as such, and that access to water is an inalienable human right.
As socialists, we do not share the idea that water is an economic commodity, which excludes its social and cultural character, and we think that the protection and defence of water should not be guided by the rules of the market economy.
With regard to the amendment on the Spanish National Hydrological Plan that, according to Mrs Flemming, we should withdraw, both my colleagues and myself, who presented it, are not going to withdraw it.
We think that it is reasonable, that it criticises an EU country' s hydrological plan that is unsustainable from the economic, social and environmental points of view, and that it clearly contradicts the European Union' s Sustainable Development Strategy.
For this reason, we are not going to withdraw the amendment.
We hope that other Members will vote for it and we trust that this will be the case.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I want to thank the European Parliament for the resolution on the Commission communication on pricing policies for enhancing the sustainability of water resources.
I want especially to thank Mrs Flemming who took on the task of rapporteur for this very sensitive issue.
The communication must be seen in conjunction with the launch of the new water policy in Europe - the water framework directive, adopted last year.
The aim of the communication is to establish guiding principles to support the implementation of the article on water pricing, that is to say Article 9 of the directive.
The European Parliament' s draft opinion covers all the relevant issues affecting water pricing, from the covering of environmental costs to transparency and consumer participation.
Moreover, emphasis is given to areas in which more research and analysis are required in order to ensure that future water pricing policy also embraces environmental, economic and social aspects.
Part of this analysis will naturally be carried out in conjunction with the drawing up of management plans for river basin areas in accordance with the water framework directive.
The views of the European Parliament will form the basis for future work at EU level aimed at implementing a more sustainable pricing policy.
In this connection, allow me also to say something about what is happening in connection with the common strategy agreed by the Member States and the Commission to facilitate the implementation of the water framework directive.
Working parties, including a working party on economic issues, have already been set up. These working parties are to develop implementation guidelines.
The European Parliament will be kept informed about the future development of water pricing issues at EU level.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Packaging and packaging waste
The next item on the agenda is the Report (A5-0323/2001) by Mrs Corbey on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on implementation of Directive 94/62/EC [2000/2319(INI)] of 20 December 1994 of the European Parliament and the Council on packaging and packaging waste.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the waste mounting is still growing.
Packaging only plays a minor, albeit visible, role in the environmental problem and is a source of irritation to many people.
Packaging could be used as an example of a fresh approach to environmental problems.
We must make sustainable development viable.
We can adopt all the sound ideas from the sixth environmental action programme and apply these to the packaging policy.
Fortunately, we are not starting from scratch.
We have had a packaging directive since 1994, which we can use as a basis to work from.
The packaging directive has a dual purpose: to reduce the harmful environmental impact of packaging to a minimum and to guarantee the functioning of the internal market.
It is important for Parliament to consider how the directive operates in practice, for we must learn from experience.
Compliance with legislation is important, but the effectiveness of the legislation is at least as important.
In the field of compliance, there is good news and bad news.
The good news is that nearly all Member States have implemented the directive well.
Most objectives have been fulfilled, and Greece recently became the last Member State to inform the Commission of its measures and the results it had achieved.
The Member States all did it their own way: Germany by means of the green dot system, the Netherlands by means of the voluntary agreements, etc.
However, there is also bad news, and I should like to mention four points.
Firstly, the volume of packaging waste is still on the increase.
Prevention of excessive packaging was an express objective, although it is not further specified in the directive.
Only in four countries has the volume of packaging materials diminished.
We clearly need to be more ambitious in this respect.
Secondly, the proportion of plastic in waste is growing.
The directive prescribes a very modest target for plastic: at least 15% must be recycled.
But even this minimum target has only been achieved by four countries, namely Germany, Austria, Belgium and Sweden.
More than 50% of all products are wrapped in plastic.
As it is difficult to recycle plastic, something must be done about this.
Thirdly, reliable and comparable data is lacking.
The Member States all have their own way of collating data and it is unclear, for example, whether plastic waste that is exported is also included in the figures.
Political decisions must be based on sound data, and the directive must be adapted accordingly.
To finish off, I should like to mention one major point: it is, in fact, unclear what the environmental effect is of all the collection, sorting, recycling and re-use.
We think it is positive, and that is probably the case, but a sound assessment of environmental effects is required in order to continue to motivate consumers to separate their waste.
Furthermore, the effect on the internal market, this directive' s second pillar, is equally vague.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is clearly time for a change.
We need better reporting, better definitions and in addition to this, I would suggest a threefold approach.
First of all, we must devote more attention to recycling.
The targets must be raised considerably and we must encourage the use of recycled materials.
Special attention must be given to plastic.
To date, plastic has had no positive residual value.
In order to make the collecting and sorting of plastic profitable nevertheless, a levy is required, and I would ask the Commission once again to quickly present the revised proposal now.
Secondly, I would ask the Commission to promote re-use.
For that purpose, situations must be identified where re-use is useful from an environmental point of view.
That is connected with transport distances and the materials.
Thirdly, we must accord prevention a far more prominent role.
For that purpose, I suggest making the manufacturers responsible.
On the basis of a lifecycle analysis, manufacturers must demonstrate that they have chosen the best possible packaging for their product from an environmental point of view.
The question is, of course, how this can be measured.
The emission of CO2, the use of natural ancillary resources, harmful substances and residual waste must definitely form part of the equation.
By adopting this approach, environmental costs can be charged on as part of the product, and that is the direction in which we need to be heading.
We must define clearer environmental parameters within which the market can go about its business and manufacturers can make choices.
Manufacturer responsibility must be further detailed and the Commission must now take the stakeholders dialogue seriously.
The interested parties from each sector, not only from industry but also consumers and representatives of environmental organisations, must be invited.
This can lead to a refreshing approach which can be incorporated in clear guiding principles.
In addition to the three above-mentioned points, fellow MEPs have added a number of useful suggestions: clear responsibility not only for products but also for retailers; paying attention to the role of local councils and of consumers; and paying attention to planning and transport packaging.
I welcome these suggestions with open arms.
The long-overdue revision of the packaging directive is an opportunity to demonstrate that the internal market can be reconciled with the environment, and we must not let this opportunity slip.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by acknowledging the great work done by Mrs Corbey in drawing up this report.
It is clear that in this particular case we are dealing with a directive whose implementation has been very complicated in the majority of Member States, given that the fine-tuning of the mechanisms needed to meet the objectives of the directive is in itself a very complicated issue.
It is one thing to issue a piece of legislation, because everything holds up on paper, and a completely different thing to put it into practice.
I thank the rapporteur for the commitments we have been able to make and I regret that we could not agree on certain points, which are by no means trivial ones.
Firstly I would like to make it patently clear that this should have been a report on the implementation of the directive on packaging, but it has turned into a report that is trying to tell the Commission the direction it should be taking with regard to the revision of the directive in question.
It is a clear example of the temptation that we frequently give into in this Parliament, which is to forget that it is the Commission that holds the legislative initiative.
We in the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats propose the following: Firstly, that the objectives for the prevention and reduction of packaging waste should not be binding, nor should they be classified by material, in order that competitiveness is maintained between them.
For we should not forget that the legal basis of this directive is the environment and also the internal market.
We think, however, that these objectives should be linked to the quantity of the product that is packaged and put on the market.
Secondly: the responsibility for the prevention and removal of packaging and packaging waste must be shared between producers, packaging companies, retailers and consumers, and not only the producer, as the draft report proposes.
Thirdly: Life Cycle Analysis is a very useful method from an environmental point of view, that should be taken into account, but it cannot be proposed as the standard norm to ensure that the requirements of Annex II are being met.
These standard norms should be issued by the European Committee for Standardisation and this body, in turn, should continue working in this direction.
Fourthly, we are against introducing any other new standard apart from the so-called 'green dot' , already in use in most countries.
Lastly, we propose that the recitals alluding to the situation in specific Member States in 1998 with regard to compliance with the objectives of the directive be removed, for at this time the directive was in the process of being transposed, and the data, and I quote directly from recital B, "are not meaningful for the purpose of assessing the real degree to which the directive's objectives have been met" .
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs Corbey for addressing these issues and writing this own-initiative report.
We really need to discuss packaging.
I nonetheless think - and I say this following 30 years' experience of environmental issues and environmental debate - that, as usual, we have an incredible talent for running after problems and battening upon them.
To discuss packaging solely from the perspective of waste, as we are doing now and have always done, is completely wrong.
I address the Commissioner with responsibility for environmental issues directly and appeal to her to allow us to discuss the whole chain.
We have to discuss logistics, transport and the packaging that eventually becomes waste.
Above all, the amount of consumer packaging must and can be reduced.
You and I come from the same country, and we know that experiments led to a 30 per cent reduction in the quantity of material in consumer packaging over approximately three years.
It is possible.
I might perhaps be allowed to appeal for the forthcoming White Paper on Integrated Product Policy to address the whole of the logistical chain, something which did not feature in the Green Paper. That would be a merciful answer to our prayers.
Mr President, my group very much supports the report by Mrs Corbey and the compromise amendments, which improve the text.
We also have some amendments of our own which we would urge Members of Parliament to support, particularly as the directive makes it more difficult for Member States with more progressive policies to go ahead in a more environmentally friendly way.
There should be nothing to prevent Member States from making progress.
I received a briefing from my own Department of the Environment in Ireland today, bemoaning the fact that it was going to be very difficult for Ireland.
That is only because Ireland has done nothing about the waste problem or about packaging.
In two other amendments we look to the Commission to present a proposal which takes proper account of the role of packaging throughout the logistics chain.
It should also be putting forward proposals on prevention and reduction. That is where the problem really lies.
We need to reduce and prevent the amount of packaging first of all, not look at what we are going to do with it afterwards, particularly the amount that goes into landfill.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Corbey, thank you for the work you have put in on this report.
I would very much like to start by asking you, Commissioner, why you have brought before Parliament a report on the implementation of the packaging directive when the revision of the Packaging Regulations is already before us.
I would very much like to know if there is a strategy for this, whether you need more time for a new debate on strategy and whether you are in the process of moving over from a product policy to a materials policy.
As I now observe, that is a vain labour of love, as you are now applying yourself to other things.
You are right, Mrs Corbey, to say that packaging waste is increasing, and so it is entirely right and proper for us to concern ourselves with these Packaging Regulations and with those to be enacted in the future.
I simply think that we must first discuss what has actually been done by the Member States.
Were the old Packaging Regulations from the Nineties right, or did we make mistakes?
Did we rightly see how things would turn out today?
Is there not a multitude of loopholes?
As you mentioned, databases are largely lacking.
Has transposition into national law really taken place punctually and in the way we intend, and is the hierarchy envisaged by the Packaging Regulations actually as flexible as we need it to be in the future?
I do not believe so.
Yet we must, now that the Commission has imposed on us this report on implementation, concentrate on these important matters.
It is unfortunately not our present task to consider what quotas have to be set for landfill dumping, recycling, and so on.
Let me make clear that I regret that.
There are a lot of other points I would like to make.
Having lost the first minutes, though, I shall admit defeat and carry on debating in the next round.
Can you please briefly repeat the question you have just put?
Commissioner, I would like to know why you are presenting us with a report on the implementation of the Packaging Regulations, because we all know well enough that the revised Packaging Regulations have already arrived.
My question is whether this is to do with a new strategy.
Is it the case that you want in future to leave product policy behind and turn your attention to the torrents of refuse?
Mr President, these oversight reports by Parliament are very important because we need not only to examine new legislation but to look back to see what has happened to the legislation we have adopted.
Mrs Corbey is quite right to name names.
The Member States were supposed to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the packaging directive before 30 June 1996.
That did not happen.
Two things should flow from the findings Mrs Corbey has put before us.
Firstly, we must ask whether the original directive, as Mr Florenz has said, was defective or whether ministers were not honest with themselves about what they could achieve when they adopted it.
The answer is probably a combination of the two.
Secondly, we should ask why the Commission did not act more quickly than it has to investigate why the directive was struggling to gain universal compliance.
I regret that Mrs Corbey did not focus on these questions.
Individual countries have had very different experiences as each has put a recovery system in place.
My own evidence from the United Kingdom is that our system has been too bureaucratic.
One businessman in Cornwall complained to me that he had to employ a graduate specifically to keep a track of his firm's obligations under the directive.
What lessons are there from our experience which could underpin the revision of the directive, or at least a revision of the way that Member States are applying it?
The Commission is wrong if it proposes higher targets for recycling.
This is the easy way out, but the wrong way.
Such targets cannot take account of the considerable variations and circumstances between Member States, so we will end up with an even bigger range of results than we have now, creating trade barriers and distorting competition.
If we are to get EU environmental law that really makes a difference, we must, within much broader targets, allow Member States to adopt solutions best suited to their respective local environments and economies.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, allow me to accord due recognition to Mrs Corbey as rapporteur.
I would thank her for her work on this own-initiative report including a resolution on implementation of Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste.
The report addresses relevant issues and will be of great importance when the Commission goes on to prepare the revision of the directive.
We have also noted that the European Parliament would like to carry out a more extensive review of the issues affecting packaging waste.
I think this is necessary, but things must be done in the right order.
We have now committed ourselves to tabling before long a proposal for revision of the existing proposal and for new targets.
This, moreover, is something we are going to do.
I anticipate the Commission' s being able, before the end of the year, to take a decision on the promised revision of the Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste.
After that, we must look to the longer term considerations addressed by Mrs Paulsen and Mrs Jackson.
We must therefore adopt several different approaches to this work.
The first revolves around an Integrated Product Policy. I want to state in no uncertain terms that we have specifically emphasised life cycle analysis and this way of looking at the issues.
Certainly, further efforts are required and further proposals and ideas about how to proceed, but the life cycle analysis contains the whole mode of thinking and way of approaching this issue.
It is important that we continue to work with an Integrated Product Policy.
The second revolves around the thematic strategies we have promised under the Sixth Environmental Action Programme.
In the course of next year, there will be two such strategies which will be of great importance to our attitude towards these issues: recycling and use of resources.
In connection with these strategies, there will be the opportunity to review the whole of our policy in terms of looking at each individual waste stream.
Are we to continue to do this, and how are we to look at this issue in broad outline?
It is important for us to take this major initiative, but we must do it in the right way and at the right time.
In my judgment, we must handle the problems via Integrated Product Policy and via the thematic strategies.
Before the end of the year, the promised revision of the specific targets for packaging and packaging waste will take place.
It is perfectly correct to point out that we need to review the whole of this issue in order to obtain a policy which will last for many years into the future and which will mean that we do not need to go chasing frantically after problems.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Insurance mediation
The next item on the agenda is the Report (A5-0359/2001) by Mr Berenguer Fuster on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive [COM(2000) 511 - C5-0484/2000 - 2000/0213(COD)] on insurance mediation.
Mr President, even at this unreasonably late hour, I am honoured to submit for your consideration the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on insurance mediation.
In my opinion it is a good proposal, on which the Commission should be congratulated.
Above all, it is a proposal that manages to find a balance between the various interests concerned.
In the area that it is intended to regulate, these interests include those of intermediaries, of insurance companies, and also, and this must not be forgotten, the interests of consumers, although these usually put less pressure on Members than the aforementioned interested parties.
All of these interests should be taken into account, and when I say that this proposal is a balanced one, I am referring to the fact that there is a balance between all of the various interests concerned.
Not to mention that the amendments tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs must aim to uphold this balance that the Commission has scrupulously maintained.
There are also other interests which are, in my opinion, less worthy of consideration.
I am talking about sectors whose main aim is to uphold the status they currently enjoy in their respective countries, which will be impossible to sustain when we attempt to produce a harmonisation standard.
If the aim of each country, or of each sector in each country, is that the forthcoming directive should not in any way affect the status quo, the only possible solution will, therefore, be not to have a harmonisation standard, or if it is required in an area such as this, that there should be no internal market in the specific sector in question.
This aspiration can disguise an attempt for the harmonisation standard to respond exclusively to the current model in a specific country; or, put in more favourable terms, to suggest that Member States should not apply important parts of the directive.
Ladies and gentlemen, do you not think that these exceptions could render the harmonisation standard meaningless?
Do you not realise that taking this route will cause problems for the internal market?
The proposal for a directive included certain exceptions, and it is true that the report enlarges on some of these, but I think that these exceptions are within the bounds of what is reasonable.
The idea that those who sell insurance on behalf of travel agencies or veterinary surgeons have to be registered intermediaries should be excluded, for this falls within what is reasonable.
Even now, I firmly believe that the further extension of exceptions could end up in nullifying the effect of the directive or, to put it differently, could end up by limiting, to a certain extent, the creation of an internal market in insurance mediation.
I still insist, and please forgive me for doing so in this way, that the resultant report includes several special features that certain countries have to ease the adoption of the directive.
For example, amendments relating to the tied agent that were designed to find a solution to ease the adaptation of legislation in those countries in which there is currently no regulation in this field.
There are, evidently, other formulas, and one of these was the one set out in the Commission proposal, and another that consists of my personal viewpoint stated in my original report.
However, neither the original formula nor my original proposal would be completely satisfactory to a good number of my fellow Members, who hold different positions, which is why compromise amendments had to be tabled that, I think, should resolve the problem reasonably clearly.
I would like you to be aware, ladies and gentlemen, that the result that is being submitted for your consideration is the outcome of a compromise between different points of view that, when seen as a whole, are acceptable.
It is only for this reason and out of respect for this compromise that the Group of the Party of European Socialists has decided not to table any more amendments, with the exception of three that are simply of a technical nature, that aim to correct inconsistencies in the text.
Clear proof of this fact is the refusal to table any amendments such as those tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, that were subsequently defeated at committee stage and with which I personally agreed, because these are not only in line with the main points of my original proposal, but they also seek to provide better consumer protection, something with which I will always agree.
Mr President, I feel that, as Mr Berenguer Fuster said, the Commission proposal fills a large gap in the internal insurance market which has been created by the huge development in insurance and reinsurance transactions recently, particularly relating to the insurance of specific interests, and here I refer to the major industrial and commercial risks, while the market for private individuals and other smaller risks has been left rather to its own devices, resulting in a sort of free-for-all.
We know how sensitive insurance mediation is, and our directive concerns precisely the mediation aspect.
That is why we found the Commission' s proposal both balanced and interesting, although possibly a little overcomplicated, which is why we have endeavoured to streamline it with a series of amendments - I am, of course speaking on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which has drafted its opinion - to make the sector which does not focus primarily on insurance rather more mobile and marketable.
There are, in fact, many entities, such as travel and tour agencies, whose main activity is not insurance but which do sell risk and life insurance as part of their business. Such transactions clearly lie outside and are not bound by the usual conventions of professionalism and honour, by the extremely stringent and far-reaching requirements, that is, which guarantee precisely that good faith and reliability and credibility that should be high priority in insurance.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are four points I would like to address.
The first is that the insurance business is based on trust.
Trust has a dual basis: trust in the product on the one hand, and on the other, trust in the other party's sales personnel and in their way of doing business.
It needs, then, to be said today that the absolute majority of all sales personnel and brokers do their work in a proper way; otherwise the insurance business would not be flourishing and justifying the trust placed in it by its customers.
Secondly, I would like to thank all those who have worked on this report.
Thirdly, many States' laws on insurance and banking already impose strict duties of consultation and information, which are binding also on brokers.
Insurers and credit institutions are subject to supervision and obligatory registration and to clear regulations on policy.
Quite independently of that, I share the directive's desire to guarantee the creation of a high professional standard for insurance brokers, to establish a single register for cross-frontier operations and to secure a high level of protection for insurance enterprises.
Over and above what has already been said, Mr Radwan and I have tabled three amendments - Nos 57, 58, and 59 - in which we intend, firstly, to have it left to the Member States to decide whether to exempt insurance brokers dealing in commercial risks from the requirements of the directive; secondly, to have the intermediary activity end with the conclusion of the contract, as is customary; and thirdly, to make a clearer distinction between those who work as insurance brokers as their main occupation and those for whom this activity is incidental to another.
Mr President, the PPE-DE Group broadly welcomes this long-overdue overhaul of the original 1977 directive as part of the single market in financial services, which utilises the financial passport or single licence concept.
This involves minimal harmonisation, the setting of professional standards and consumer safeguards as well as mutual recognition between Member States, to enable brokers to enjoy freedom of establishment throughout the Union with rules to ensure prudential care for the good conduct of their business.
I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, on his largely cooperative cross-party approach in committee, appropriate to a technical report which provides quality assurance to the consumer.
It is worth noting that approximately 95% of European consumers use the services of insurance brokers and will be affected by this directive, along with 100 000 insurance practitioners in the Union.
The vast majority of areas of political difference were resolved in a series of compromise amendments, as well as those requirements due to the peculiar structure of the German industry.
I was delighted at the adoption of a large number of my own amendments, ranging from exemptions for the travel industry, to recognition of the role of the computer and the Internet and the future role of e-commerce for insurance, as well as safeguards for a three-yearly review of eligibility for registration, and protection for businesses located offshore outside the EU.
I hope this report will not increase the burden to intermediaries, in terms of cost or difficulty, or of conducting normal business practices, but will open up a competitive and transparent market throughout the 15 Union Member States, which ultimately, by providing volume and economy of scale, will provide real savings which will be handed down to the citizens of the Union.
Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Parliament for the efforts to complete its first reading of the proposal for a directive on insurance mediation.
I would like to thank in particular the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer, and also Mr Ferri, for the quality of their work which has resulted in the recommendation submitted to this plenary.
The proposal for a directive on insurance mediation, scheduled in the action plan for financial services, is a key text to achieve a true internal market in insurance, in particular as regards retail markets.
Insurance intermediaries play a fundamental role in the sale of insurance in the Community and their importance would increase with the emergence of more complex and sophisticated insurance products.
Although the internal market in insurance has been completed as regards insurance undertakings, especially concerning the prudential rules, insurance intermediaries continue to be confronted with several obstacles which prevent them from taking full advantage of the freedoms of the Treaty.
The proper functioning of the internal market is therefore hindered.
I am particularly pleased that Parliament agrees with the essential objectives of the Commission's proposals. It seeks to ensure that insurance intermediaries possess a high level of professional competence and that an intermediary, duly registered in his home Member State, may conduct his activities throughout the internal market.
The proposal also aims to guarantee the protection of customers by setting appropriate information requirements.
I now turn to the amendments submitted to the plenary session.
The Commission can accept the following amendments: Nos 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 17, 28, 30, 37 and the second part of No 58. It can also accept either partially or in their spirit the following amendments: 3, 7, 11, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 32, 44 and 51.
Amendment Nos 15 and 16 may also be accepted in part.
The Commission is not, however, in a position to accept the other amendments tabled for the following reasons.
Amendment Nos 2, 10, 13, 14, 46, 47, 49, 52 and 57 aim to exclude from the scope of the proposal some activities such as those of travel agencies, veterinarians and persons acting on an occasional basis, and therefore these amendments cannot be accepted.
These exclusions would affect the sale of insurance products involving important risks and are therefore rejected.
The same reasons explain the non-acceptance of Amendment Nos 12 and 50.
The Commission considers that the term "insurance intermediary" is defined in an appropriate manner.
The scope of the directive is well balanced.
Amendment Nos 15 and 16 are therefore not necessary since the definition covers all intermediation activities, including those carried out by electronic means.
The same applies to Amendment Nos 19 and 25 which relate to sub-agents and also to Amendment Nos 20 and 58.
As regards the issue of "bancassurance", all forms of "bancassurance" activities should fall within the scope of the proposal.
It is an increasingly important way of distributing insurance.
Amendment Nos 18 and 22 propose a definition of "bancassurance" activities which only takes account of one of the possible forms that "bancassurance" may take.
They are therefore rejected.
There are amendments relating to registration and professional requirements of insurance intermediaries.
Amendment Nos 31 and 56 would imply less strict rules to cover professional negligence of insurance intermediaries. They would jeopardise the objective of ensuring an appropriate level of professional liability cover for insurance intermediaries in the internal market.
Amendment No 33, 34 and 54 would affect the overall coherence of the proposal which is based on the principle of home country control.
Amendment No 35 and 36 concern complaint schemes and out-of-court redress mechanisms of the proposal.
Amendment No 35 is already implicit in the text of the proposal and is not necessary.
Amendment No 36 does not seem appropriate in the context of a directive since it contains a specific reference to a Commission recommendation which is not legally binding on the Member States.
Thirdly there are amendments referring to information requirements.
A key element of the Commission proposal is to ensure a high level of protection of consumers through the provision of appropriate information and advice.
Amendment Nos 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 55, 60 and 61 would compromise considerably this objective.
Finally, Amendment Nos 6, 45 and 48 which provide that non-registered persons excluded from the scope of the directive should comply with information requirements, would be extremely difficult for the Member States to implement in practice.
I am sorry to have talked so long about these amendments, but Parliament has a right to know what the Commission thinks.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I have always had the childish ambition to have us finish at midnight.
Tonight we have missed it by only ten seconds.
(The sitting was closed at midnight.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, I have two observations with regard to the Minutes.
The first is the least important: on the first point, with regard to the votes on request for urgent procedure, the first point voted on was on the fisheries agreement with Morocco. I was here and voted in favour, but this has not been recorded in the Minutes.
I was here, and I spoke immediately afterwards.
I would now like to refer to the second point.
With regard to the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, yesterday morning a deadline for tabling amendments was set for 10.00 a.m. this morning, in order that the debate may be held tonight, probably at the last minute.
The political groups were working yesterday in order to be able to table amendments, and today I see in the Minutes that the item has been added to the agenda of Wednesday 28 November and that the deadline for tabling amendments has been set for Thursday 22 November.
I would like to point out, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, that we cannot work upon the text submitted by the Commission, that we were working on yesterday.
There is only one version available in one language, and, in addition to this, in this language there are different versions of the same text with various discrepancies between them.
Lastly, to give just one example, and I shall finish on this note, Mr President, it states that the Commission is proposing a single contribution of 120 million, yet it does not state whether these are euros, dollars, condoms or DDT.
I think that the Commission should provide a text that is correct, tell us which of the texts is the final version, and make this available in all of the official languages.
We will make sure your vote is recorded.
Regarding the question of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, the documents are not ready, as you correctly say.
That was the reason why it was put back to 28 November.
That will also give the committee some more time to deliberate on the matter and make sure that the text is correct.
That was the basis for the reasoning and you are quite right to raise it.
Mr President, as someone who has consistently called in this House for an early report from the presidency on the progress of our own staff reforms, can I be the first to welcome the fact that we received a letter from the President yesterday on this subject.
It was an undated letter but I assume it was issued yesterday.
However, I should like to register again my concern that we still need more information.
Mrs Fontaine says in her letter: "I believe the time has come to provide all Members with the fullest possible details".
I am afraid this is not the "fullest possible details", since half of it is a letter to Mr Prodi.
I should like you to ask the Bureau and the presidency to give us in this House, as soon as possible, a comparison of the proposed personnel reforms in this parliamentary institution with the reforms proposed in the Commission.
And bearing in mind that on 28 October the Commission adopted their new personnel strategy, can we please have an early debate in this House with Mr Kinnock about his reforms and with the presidency about their reforms, so that Members can be properly informed.
We must have a chance to debate this and to understand why the presidency of this House is proposing in one instance radically different changes to those proposed for the Commission.
I, along with many other colleagues, am concerned about that different approach.
Mr Harbour, your point is well made and well understood by the Bureau.
The House is sovereign at the end of the day.
I will certainly pass on your message in the strongest possible terms to the presidency, so that the matter can be resolved.
I am sure everybody is aware that there is an ongoing discussion within the Commission itself at the present time.
Until the overall situation is clarified Parliament cannot come to any firm conclusions itself.
I do not have the letter in front of me, but in it the President has pointed out that the Conference of Presidents and the Bureau were fairly unanimous in the point of view they have adopted.
Parliament is sovereign, as I have said, and the matter will be open for further discussion.
There is no doubt about that.
(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)
European Research Area (Multiannual Framework Programme 2002-2006)
The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:
(A5-0376/2001) by Gérard Caudron, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the multiannual framework programme 2002-2006 of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities aimed at contributing towards the creation of the European Research Area [COM(2001) 94 - C5-0087/2001 - 2001/0053(COD)];
(A5-0355/2001) by Gérard Caudron, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the multiannual framework programme 2002-2006 of the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) for research and training activities aimed at contributing towards the creation of the European Research Area [COM(2001) 94 - C5-0171/2001 - 2001/0054(CNS)].


Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I begin my speech as general rapporteur for the Sixth Framework Programme on Research, I must first express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who have helped me in this difficult task. As you know, this is an important programme.
It has a provisional budget of EUR 17.5 billion, including Euratom. I would like to thank the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies, the European Commission, Commissioner Busquin, Mr Westendorp, the Secretariat of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the ITER Committee, the administrators of the different groups, my assistant Gaëlle Le Bouler, the shadow rapporteurs of the ITER Committee, the draftsmen of the opinion, the shadow draftsmen of the committees consulted and the group coordinators.
I think that I am now in a position to declare that together we have completed a truly remarkable task. I am sure you will all agree with me on this.
You will express your view when we vote. I am sure that the result will not be the same as the outcomes of the votes on the Fourth, and especially the Fifth Framework Programme on Research and Development.
I believe that the results of our work can largely be attributed to two guiding principles.
Firstly, in my capacity as rapporteur I have always wanted to be the representative and spokesman for a broad majority in Parliament.
In addition, Commissioner Busquin was, from the start, willing to support the framework and the overall budget of the project.
In addition to this support, we have received many proposals for adjustment. These have resulted from our wide-ranging consultation with the European research sector, European politicians and all the organisations and citizens with an interest in the European research sector.
I can personally list more than 250 meetings, talks and discussions on this project and this report since the beginning of 2001. Furthermore, I have tried to ensure transparency during work on this project.
I have published all available information and views on the subject in real time on my website. In recent months, this website has been visited more than 3 000 times per month, excluding the summer holiday period.
Clearly, all of us, myself included, have agreed to set up a genuine European Research Area and all the necessary structures, including the Joint Research Centre, on the basis of the Framework Programme on Research and Development.
We have agreed too that we need to act upon the idea of European added value, as proposed by the European Commission.
But, at the same time, we have all declared that we should take into consideration another aspect of added value: the added value of giving research a European dimension. This supplements the accounting added value of the European Commission.
As I have already said, we should not allow there to be any perception or feelings of exclusion, and we should back researchers who believe that their work needs to be carried out at a European level.
All this translates into two new, secondary priorities. Firstly, there is the fight against major diseases.
This goes hand-in-hand with research on the human genome, with its anticipated results for health. Secondly, we need to consider terrestrial and maritime transport.
The objectives here are to improve links between different means of transport, and to improve flexibility, security, efficiency, and coherence. In this regard, the quality and improvement of the environment are important considerations.
So far as the functioning of the framework programme is concerned, there are proposals to ensure that there is a smooth transfer between the old instruments of the Fourth and Fifth Framework Programmes and the Commission' s three new instruments. In addition, there is the fourth 'stairway of excellence' instrument.
Further, all this translates into a compromise on the specific programmes involved. The proposal is for a single programme with eight sub-programmes.
This will increase coherence while providing sufficient scope for participation and adequate control. There are also specific measures to improve professional life and mobility for researchers, while taking account of the requirement to strengthen the role of micro-enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses.
As regards the Euratom section, the majority of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy also agreed on the principles and the structure of the Commission' s text, especially regarding the need to ensure security of energy supply, risk reduction, and the processing of nuclear waste. Lastly, the majority of the Committee on Industry agreed on the importance of research on nuclear fusion.
They also agreed on the need to construct an experimental reactor soon, and for it to be located in Europe if possible. This is necessary so that we may have some chance of meeting our energy requirements in fifty years' time.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament will today establish a firm and sound position after our first reading.
I am delighted that progress has not been hindered by what occurred on Monday evening. The situation where the adoption of my reports would have been dependent on the conclusions of the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics has been avoided.
By midday I hope that we will also reach agreement on ethical rules and on stem cell research on supernumerary embryos.
The vote today could also benefit the debate and votes to be held on the Fiori report during the November sitting in Brussels.
In this, we must be guided by common sense and tolerance and respect the views of others.
The result of the votes held by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 16 and 22 October has already been noted by the 'Research' Council of 30 October, judging by its final communiqué.
A new 'Research' Council will publish its common position next December. I hope it will then be possible, through the codecision procedure, we will be able to reach a common decision by favouring informal discussions.
I would not like to place a bet on our not needing to resort to conciliation. We might or we might not.
However, I would like to reiterate this point: the sooner we finish our work in 2002, the sooner partners working in the research sector will be able to prepare and so ensure the best possible transition to the Fifth Framework Programme. Also, the sooner we finish our work, the sooner we will be able to develop international partnerships with candidate countries and associated countries, and pursue all our other international ventures.
I would like to finish where I began, by thanking all those involved in this splendid project. I call on the Commission and the Council to listen to us, and, more importantly, to ensure that they understand us.
Our demands are not unrealistic; neither are we engaged in politics here. They are proposals by European citizens, considered and debated at length.
We therefore call for them to be studied.
Further work will of course need to be undertaken when it comes to the final agreement, but for the moment we simply need to be free to define our own position.
I would like to conclude by reminding you of an objective set in January.
We set out to turn this work into an opportunity for a wide-ranging debate to strengthen the important link between science and society. We set out to convince people that, although science does not have all the answers, we cannot hope to tackle the world' s greatest problems without science, research and researchers.
I hope that our work will have made a positive contribution in this regard. I also hope that it will provide the Commission and the Council with proposals from the European research sector which will form the basis of a Sixth Framework Programme on Research and Development for Europe in 2002.
I really believe we should call it the Sixth Framework Programme.
The programme will be innovative, realistic, and effective.
It will be a firm foundation for the development of the European research sector, a sector we all support.
, draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, and also my gratitude for the debate he has stimulated.
He has really tried to make a reality of the wide-ranging citizens' debate of which he speaks.
He has tried to involve many people, within and outside Parliament, and in research circles, in order to have an intelligent discussion here and prepare a good compromise.
From the point of view of the Committee on Budgets, I must say, I support the rapporteur, but I am being pulled in two directions, because I at the same time have to announce that my group has misgivings and will not vote in favour of this resolution in its entirety.
I am here, then, primarily playing my role as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.
It has to be said on this point that the budget for this Sixth Research Framework Programme ranges between the right limits.
A slight increase was achieved, but at the same time the allocation was not exceeded, in other words the programme is, in budgetary terms, within proper and sensible limits.
I think we can achieve real European added value with this proposal.
We also had discussions with the Commission about possible simplification of the procedure, that also being one of our Committee's concerns, so that approval might be granted more quickly.
The Commission has made good proposals on this point, and we are very confident that this speeding-up of procedures can be achieved in order that the partners in projects can access their funds more quickly.
At the same time, our side urged once more that proper account should be taken of the smaller project partners and that smaller projects should not fall by the wayside in a slimmed-down procedure, because it is in the sphere of the smaller projects that a lot of important work has been done.
There is one bitter pill for our group above all others to swallow, and that is the issue of renewable energies and the issue of the Euratom resources.
Speaking from my group's point of view, I have to say that we have problems with the fact that renewable energies have not been developed as they should have been, and that too much has been approved, especially in the fusion field.
Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the Caudron report, I should like to offer the rapporteur our Committee' s congratulations and thanks for the job he has done, which was not a simple one.
His report provides a balanced discussion of all the main arguments on which the European institutions should concentrate their attention as regards scientific research and the potential for technological and social development.
The Committee on Freedoms particularly stresses the need for the public promotion of research to be done with the greatest possible transparency and involvement of the citizens.
A European knowledge-based society, like the one the Union is proposing, requires not only huge-scale initiatives in literacy, including scientific literacy, for all the citizens but also an increasingly intense, active involvement of the citizens in decisions regarding the direction that investment in this field should take.
Non-specialist citizens, in other words, should not just enjoy or, as is often the case, suffer the results achieved by science, but should also join with the experts in deciding on the objectives that research should pursue.
We believe the validity of a European science policy should be measured especially on this criterion.
The Caudron report quite rightly addresses these aspects.
I believe the Caudron report also invokes the transparent and democratic nature of decisions on scientific research when, instead of invoking principles of natural law, which are, in fact, only held by certain authorities, it refers, in the case of the ethical problems of research, to charters of rights, the documents which have effectively been approved and sanctioned by our Institutions.
This means, for instance, in the field of stem cell research, respecting the feelings of a large number of European citizens by ruling out the production of stem cells for research, but allowing research to be conducted on those supernumerary cells that would otherwise be destroyed.
On this and other matters I believe we should go with the Caudron report.
Mr President, the European Commission is proposing an appropriation of EUR 17 billion, fully recognising the importance of research and technological innovation in Europe.
Unfortunately, research projects today often do not achieve the hoped-for success which would allow them to compete at an international level, and the European Union does not hold enough attraction to lure back the top researchers who have chosen to work abroad.
The new scheme should bring in some changes: firstly, concentrate financial aid on a restricted, specific number of priority subjects for Europe; secondly, invite researchers to collaborate more closely; and thirdly, increase the mobility of researchers by creating a working environment in Europe that is attractive to them.
These priorities form the framework for the 42 amendments tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, many of which have been incorporated, for which I thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which is competent in this matter.
These amendments concern employment, health and safety at work, access to work for the disabled, small and medium-sized enterprises and European Community research centres.
With regard to employment, we have seen an amendment adopted which seeks to extend research to the development of operating systems and computer hardware in Europe in order to increase employment and stop us from being so heavily dependent on the United States and Japan in this area.
This is a key sector for the new economy and would entail considerable risks for the sake of economic and employment growth.
Then we asked for action in the field of health and safety at work, in order to encourage access for the socially excluded and disadvantaged, such as people with disabilities.
Research support for small and medium-sized enterprises has also been accepted with very favourable terms, it has gone up from 15 to 30 %, and the same may be said of support for JRCs, which are to receive EUR 725 million.
In conclusion, Mr President, I must move in favour of approval, since science and research are there to serve the people, for that right to life that no one is entitled to jeopardise.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has worked intensively on the research framework programme.
We have submitted many proposals on sustainable development, food safety and other subjects, which were, thankfully, generally adopted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
We focused on medical research, as we believed that it was in this area that there was the greatest need for change to the Commission's proposal.
The Commission's suggestion that only biotechnology should be promoted in the health context is too narrow.
Other research fields, too, promise much for health and need to be supported.
I thank Mr Caudron, the rapporteur, for his commitment to this as well, and also the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mr van Velzen, for whom this was also a matter for concern.
It is regrettable that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy could not follow us as regards the ethical boundaries of medical research.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy spoke out clearly in favour of research and for the curing of illnesses, but also in favour of clear boundaries for the sake of human dignity.
In particular, our Committee demands the exclusion of exploitative research on human embryos from the research framework programme.
This ban is necessary not just because human life is involved, but also because we must counteract the danger of the female body being seen as raw material for industry.
Embryo research is not possible without women's egg cells being made available, and the donation of egg cells puts a woman under great strain and at medical risk.
It is for this reason that many feminists, too, are opposed to exploitative embryo research.
As I have said, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy could not follow us down this road, and so, together with Mr Fiori, I have tabled an amendment that follows the line taken by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which is also taken in the United States.
'Yes' to stem cell research, but 'no' to exploitative embryo research.
The Americans can be accused of many things, but not of being hostile to research.
I therefore ask for support for Amendment No 332, tabled by Messrs Fiori, Liese and others.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Caudron for his report. The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport welcomes it for a number of reasons.
It particularly welcomes the fact that the report deals with a number of matters which concern our committee.
These include the technology and methods used to convert products and works into a digital format, the protection and development of our historic and cultural heritage. We are also pleased that it deals with drug taking, as our committee is also responsible for youth and sports.
Other areas of concern contained in the report include the history of Europe, distance learning and mobility for researchers. I regret that digital cinema, the cinema of tomorrow, has disappeared from this list.
It might have required specific research. I hope that specific programmes will be able to make good this omission.
I would also like to say that I am delighted the life sciences have been recognised as a scientific subject and are not regarded simply as an instrument for other sciences.
The life sciences constitute a distinct discipline and the fact that the Sixth Framework Programme has recognised this is a great step forward.
Perhaps the first title of the seventh thematic area: 'Cultural and social research' was the most appropriate.
I am sorry it has been changed to 'Citizens, democracy, social and political institutions' .
I think the first title was better.
If we had used the title 'Cultural and social research' , it might have been easier to include research on women, and not just research carried out by women, as in the paragraph 'Science and society' .
Mr Caudron, I regret the fact that research 'on women' and the thinking included in your intermediary reports were not retained in its final version.
I would like to finish on this point.
I have been involved in drawing up reports which have gradually transformed the notion of centres of excellence. The latter became the stairway of excellence.
We, the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, were very concerned that research should not be confined to an elite. Rather, when it comes to building the European Research Area, research should be shared amongst younger researchers, a range of relevant institutions, and universities.
I note that there have been adjustments here too.
I am glad that the paragraph 'Science and society' has doubled. The matter of research 'by women' is at the heart of this paragraph.
The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities has an interest in this subject, but so does the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.

Mr President, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I submitted a series of amendments which principally endeavoured to enshrine the principle of gender mainstreaming in the Sixth Research Framework Programme, which is in any case the largest programme, for which we are voting approximately EUR 17 billion.
Concentration on other topics has meant, as Mrs Fraisse has already explained, that there has been less research into gender issues and less emphasis upon opening science and research to the full range of people with the right potential.
In 1999, 66% of the research workers in the State sector and 72% of those in higher education were men.
In only a few countries did the proportion of women exceed 40%, and that was in Ireland and Greece.
Only in Portuguese higher education, with 53%, was a balance achieved.
Women are particularly underrepresented, at 9%, in academic teaching posts in Germany.
The highest levels were in Finland with 36%.
It is therefore in the European interest and adds value if women are involved in research and teaching at every stage, from planning, via decision-making to project management, as well as in EU initiatives for prizes and competitions in all disciplines.
I had already demanded this in this House in connection with the McNally Report on women and science, and, in order to implement it, the Commission set up a Gender Unit, which now has some early successes to show.
Focused efforts have achieved a percentage of nearly 40% of women involved in the EU's research bodies and the same proportion receiving Marie Curie scholarships.
We must, then, build on the successes of the Fifth Research Framework Programme, one contribution to which might be the doubling of the budget in the 'Science and Society' subdivision, and here, too, there is a need for research into gender issues.
One final remark: In my language, the entire draft has to be revised in gender-neutral language, because we are setting the course for the future, above all for young women scientists.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to address the rapporteur and congratulate him on the outcome, but also on the excellent working relationship.
You have found an innovative method, for which we are very grateful.
Needless to say, that also applies to the shadow rapporteurs, Messrs McNally, Piétrasanta and Plooij-van Gorsel.
We worked well together.
I should also like to extend a word of thanks to my own fellow MEPs who have invested a huge amount of energy in this dossier.
This is truly a joint outcome, and I therefore hope that the Commission, as well as the Council, is prepared to take this outcome seriously.
Indeed, we have developed a structure by means of which, within the restricted margins available to us, everything has become clearer.
More emphasis has been placed on bio-sciences; a better link has been established between research on the human genome and related diseases; far more attention has been devoted to a coherent package of industrial policy, information society, nanotechnoloy, as well as aviation and aerospace.
Additionally, food safety has been accorded considerably more attention.
Furthermore, unlike the Commission, we have given transport a much higher place in our list of priorities, alongside more attention for energy.
Agriculture is also more involved.
In my view, the package is looking better now all in all.
The budget is also of major importance in my opinion.
We have expressly adhered to our pledge to the Council that we would not increase the budget.
We have slightly shifted the priorities.
We would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council to accept our budget now and not to start bargaining, for we will then have a war on our hands.
Next, we should be emphatically aware that although the EU' s contribution to research in the Member States carried out by the national governments and industry is limited, it is still of fundamental importance.
If, specifically, the EU can play a complementary role, the added value will be significant.
Not for nothing did we include a fourth instrument to guarantee the smoothest possible transition between the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programme and to allow minor projects too to take place.
More than 15% has been set aside for small- and medium-sized enterprises, and that too is one of our priorities.
The decentralisation of the Sixth Framework Programme is important, but it is just as important not to weigh down the newly integrated projects, centres of excellence, with an enormous amount of red tape.
That is why I believe our amendments are excellent.
One final point: we have struggled greatly with the ethical principles.
Indeed, on the one hand, it is important to create a framework within which research is to take place, but on the other hand, it is important, by means of further research, to create space for solutions to be found for existing illnesses with a genetic hereditary factor.
Our greatest challenge was to strike that balance, and I hope that we have succeeded in this.
Mr President, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, and Commissioner Busquin, who have both helped us to work efficiently, as have the shadow rapporteurs.
The Sixth Framework Programme is the first implementation of the European Research Area, which itself is a consequence of the Lisbon Summit and its wish for us to have a successful knowledge-based economy, because of the strong correlation between research and development and economic success - inadequate in most EU countries outside Scandinavia, I should say.
We welcome the emphasis on looking for European added value, not scattering the limited funds over the whole range of research carried out.
So I am glad that we are now targeting cutting-edge research, particularly in areas like nano-technology, which will be very significant in the future.
There are, however, some gaps in the proposals which we wish to see filled.
They include, of course, health, other than strictly post-genomic research, non-nuclear energy and land and water transport.
I come to international activities, because the research framework programme must look outside the EU as well.
It is essential that there is both earmarked money for international cooperative research - we suggest EUR 400 million - and mainstreaming across all the research, particularly on HIV/AIDS malaria and tuberculosis.
We must involve the countries that suffer from those scourges in the research.
The sums allocated in the Commissioner's proposal for science and society were inadequate.
We propose to double the spending on science and society.
We do not think that having one specific programme with one management will lead to transparency and adequate monitoring.
I therefore hope that our suggestion will ensure that we are able to have both openness and good management of each individual part of the programmes.
Although we welcome networks of excellence and integrated projects, we must maintain more familiar mechanisms at the early stages.
We must at all costs avoid the creation of scientific cartels.
I am pleased with the new mission of the JRC.
I served on Mr Davignon's panel and it is certainly consistent with the panel's views.
As far as the Euratom section of the Sixth Framework Programme is concerned, I have very grave doubts as to whether the ITER project will be implemented and my personal view - this is not the view of the rapporteur - is that extra funding is not therefore needed.
It will be available in any case.
The framework programmes are one of the big success stories of the European Union.
Let us build on their past success.
Mr President, I would first like to thank Commissioner Busquin for the way these proposals were prepared, for listening to the views of others and for his excellent collaboration.
I would also like to extend my sincere thanks to Gérard Caudron. He listened attentively to all the political groups and to the shadow rapporteurs, and others.
We have worked very well together.
I believe that he did everything he could have done.
Although there have been differences of opinion on some conclusions, the work was completed to a high standard.
My thanks also go to my fellow shadow rapporteurs.
In my opinion, this report on the Sixth Framework Programme on European Research is the big report of the moment, despite its faults. It has European added value, it is innovative as the Commissioner wished, it has networks of excellence and integrated projects.
We have a lot to do. We have also made significant progress on matters concerning young people, grants and women and preventing brain drains.
We cannot ignore all the innovative proposals in the Sixth Framework programme.
There are three issues of great concern to the Greens.
Firstly, the ethical questions. We do not want the European Union to fund the modification of the human genetic inheritance and the creation of human embryos for therapeutic reasons.
We also want to see a ban on financing research using supernumerary human embryos and the stem cells of supernumerary embryos.
From what I have heard, I think all the political groups will reach a compromise on these points.
Secondly, we would like to see an assessment of the effects of new technologies, like electromagnetic radiation for example, on populations, on health and so on.
Thirdly, we would like to achieve a fairer balance between research on renewable energies and research on nuclear energy.
I would like to reiterate the sentiments of Eryl MacNally. We do not want to see an increase in the nuclear energy or the ITER project budgets.
That is very long term.
We would however like research credits for renewable energy to be more on a par with those for nuclear energy.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I want to emphasise that I am not speaking on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
There are a good few of our members who have genuinely attended to this issue, who are on the way here to our debate today but who will not perhaps be in time for the vote.
I personally believe that we shall be adopting too many amendments.
If we examine research programmes and research issues, there is scarcely any research programme in the whole of Europe that is so driven by politicians.
That is in total contrast to, for example, the assessment made by Manuel Castells - yes, it is legitimate to call him a sociologist - together with the Finnish philosopher Pekka Himanen as to why Finland is successful as an information society.
In their perhaps otherwise rather vague book, they observe that our technology and innovation policy are successful because we have a complete and autonomous centre for technical development.
That is something which I think invites reflection.
In other contexts, it is usual to applaud Finnish innovation policy.
I think that a certain lesson can be drawn from this.
In addition, I want to emphasise an aspect of this proposal that particularly bothers me, namely that the social research proposed would certainly be allocated to the wrong place, under the Information Society DG.
Social research does not belong in that context.
I do not properly understand how this has happened.
We are also aware that interest in research issues has, to a very large extent, revolved around stem cell research.
Today, we can adopt a position on the Caudron proposal in peace and quiet.
I personally view the committee' s proposal as being well balanced.
The committee' s proposal also shows the modesty and respect that is required when we debate research issues.
I think that those who say that we should now concentrate first and foremost upon stem cells from adults are not showing the required modesty faced with this new area.
In the course of the work in the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics, I learned that we know extremely little.
We must adhere to the old principles and proceed further within the various frameworks.
Furthermore, I learned that the research projects for both forms of stem cells are dependent upon each other. It must therefore be possible for them to be given the same priority.
That, I believe, is extremely important if we are to be able to move ahead as a successful society.
I hope that these comments are not too alarming, but that they lead to reflection on the part of all who are interested in our researchers' really being able to carry out good research.
Mr President, the amount of EUR 17.5 billion of EU membership funds will be used in the next few years on scientific activities through the framework programme.
The size of this sum indicates how significant the matter in question now is.
Codecision procedure removes power from the Commission and brings it to Parliament.
In this matter it is particularly well-founded.
There are good grounds to support Mr Caudron' s model on programme coordination and administration as well as informing and listening to Parliament in decision-making at levels more detailed than that of the framework programme.
The primary research areas selected by the Commission are well-founded as are also Parliament' s complementary priorities, which are not all mere information technology and artificial intelligence.
The health of a human being depends on what he eats.
It is justified to use funds to research the whole of the food chain.
The new biotechnology involves the ethical foundations of all kinds of life, and therefore technology must also be complemented by results from human sciences.
Science must not be dependent on the ethics of big corporations, and that is why it must receive public funding.
When the health of the environment depends greatly on energy production, several adjustments made by Parliament endeavour to improve the research into new forms of energy.
It would be justified to direct more funds into the research of fusion energy than what the Commission is proposing.
There is need to build a new Tokamak for the joint use of all Member States and Switzerland, Canada, Japan and Russia.
When funding is cut, this important project is delayed, further delaying the opportunity to produce energy by fusion power, which even in the current circumstances is going to be postponed by as much as fifty years.
When the framework programme was drawn up, not enough attention was paid to the activities of the Joint Research Centre of the EU.
It will also use scientific resources.
During the coming five-year period its position within the research community of the EU and its Member States must be clarified; research resources must not be wasted.
Mr President, I should like to express concern at the Commission emphasis on large integration projects, which would impact badly on small community-based enterprises as promoted within the framework of rural development programmes and research in the agricultural and associated food sector.
It is now clearly established that the EU-assisted programmes, such as Leader, have the potential to create sustainable employment in rural areas where more centralised programmes would have failed.
I do not have the time to concentrate on the need for ongoing research in the food sector and the potential of new technology in improving product diversification, quality and consumer satisfaction.
How soon can we expect a clear and definitive view on the potential or otherwise of genetic research as applied to practical farming?
Delays in this area are leading to confusion on the part of consumers and may well be depriving European agriculture of the tools necessary for sustainability, quality and competitiveness.
What have we learned from the recent scares such as foot-and-mouth and BSE?
Will we know what to do to avoid a repetition of the demoralising experience of a foot-and-mouth epidemic out of control?
Finally, and not for the first time, I want to express my concern about research on human embryos.
This Parliament must exercise the most stringent controls in that area.
Mr President, the Caudron report is threatening to become problematic from a Christian-ethical point of view.
Controversial activities should not receive active support from the Union.
Moreover, the community of values which, after all, the EU aspires to achieve, will definitely be at risk.
Intervening in life created by God is non-negotiable.
That must be the basic principle.
In this light, the funding of research activities on surplus embryos with Community money cannot be justified in any way.
Citizens would then be forced to contribute towards research which is punishable in a Member State such as Germany and which a number of national parliaments have declared themselves openly against.
Neighbouring countries of a Member State which apply less stringent rules find themselves facing a related dilemma.
A shift of European research to the relevant Member State undermines the effectiveness of the rules.
A situation should not, however, arise in which ethical differences are exploited as a competitive factor.
That could also lead to a brain drain.
In this respect, the establishment of one European Research Area will function as a catalyst.
That is why I make a serious appeal to you to support my amendments. They aim to prevent this.
Europe must commit to finding a solution to this pending cross-border issue.
Has the Commission looked into this?
Finally, within the research framework of cross-border problems, it is not funding but cooperation which deserves a central role.
The funding of research into surplus embryos only complicates this cooperation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fundamentally welcome the Commission's proposal for the Sixth Research Framework Programme, above all the Europe-wide coordination and the emphasis laid on basic research.
Two points cause me concern.
The first is that, when it comes to the definition of fundamental ethical principles, the mind of this House is divided between, on the one hand, banning embryo stem cell research outright and, on the other, permitting it.
Where the boundary lies between a mere heap of cells and a human life is something we all no doubt have to decide for ourselves.
It is a choice with far-reaching implications, one to be made on the basis of conscience.
I would remind you, though, that research on embryo stem cells is prohibited in several Member States, including Austria.
To use EU funds to finance research in one Member State which would be banned in another is unacceptable.
The second thing that concerns me is that research funds totalling EUR 1.2 billion are being made available within the framework of the Euratom programme, over two-thirds of which go to nuclear research.
Safety issues play only a subordinate role.
I consider increased research into non-nuclear energy sources to be imperative.
I regret that there is no reference to it in this report.
- (EL) Mr President, the European Union's Sixth Framework Programme covers high-priority areas and areas of pioneering research from which we expect quantum leaps in science.
I should like to draw your attention to the pioneering area of research into the human genome.
This research is expected to have future applications in four areas of medicine: first, hereditary illnesses, secondly, the most common fatal illnesses, namely cancer, cardio-vascular and degenerative neural illnesses, thirdly, an understanding of the mechanics of various illnesses, which will lead to new, more efficient treatment and drugs and, fourthly, the prevention of disease.
New knowledge about human genetics will help us understand at which points genetic dynamics are vulnerable and open to environmental factors and pressure and the way in which we live, thereby allowing us to develop new strategies for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the illnesses which I have already mentioned.
Stem cell research may well have new applications in treating illnesses such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, leukaemia and many others.
However, the boundaries on research in these fields must be marked out if we are to avoid ethical problems.
This was the point of the amendment which I tabled together with Mr Nisticò and Mr Purvis.
This amendment will allow the pioneering research which I have described to progress while striking the balance needed in order to avoid ethical problems.
So we can look forward to the beneficial medical applications which this research promises.
I trust that the European Parliament will support the line being marked out and strike the right balance between progress and ethical considerations.
Mr President, I would like thank the rapporteur for his good method of preparation, in which he has been willing to take into account colleagues' views.
Several of us Members have been concerned about the possibilities of SMEs to participate in the framework programme, because the Commission' s original proposal does not make these opportunities concrete enough.
The Commission proposes so-called horizontal activities, in which it will be very difficult for small and medium-size enterprises to participate, at least at the initial stages.
Therefore it is necessary to make adjustments approved by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy to the direction that the already existing Craft programme arrangements will continue to take.
The same applies to preparation funds.
Enterprises have already become used to these measures, which have produced plenty of good results.
Why should a good arrangement be abolished?
Amendment No 265 concerns this matter.
A share of 15% funding from enterprises has been proposed.
Also this fact must be made concrete in the actual guideline funding schedules, when decisions on them are made at a later stage.
Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his hard work and for the many additions to the Commission's proposals, particularly on health and disease and sustainable transport.
However, this was undermined in committee by what Mr Van Velzen has already referred to as the joint result. The proposals on health and transport emerged very much weakened.
Our citizens will want to know why we want to spend more on space research than on sustainable transport.
It is not their priority.
On ethics in biotechnology, the proposals allow funding of research into the alteration of the germline of human beings.
This is unacceptable to mainstream science.
The Greens have tabled an amendment which is congruent with the position of most researchers in the field and this must be supported.
On stem cell research, the production of human embryos for research is unacceptable and it is very unacceptable to most of our citizens as well.
The Temporary Committee on Human Genetics has come to very useful conclusions here and its report should have been taken before this debate.
However, amendments have been tabled in line with its proposals and these must also be accepted by the House, otherwise we will be in deep conflict with our citizens.
As regards GMOs and plant genetics, the proposals that were adopted in committee would put genetically-modified foods on our table and will be forced on European consumers, quite contrary to what many want.
This is again a recipe for conflict and it was not in the Commission's proposals.
Regarding energy, equivalent funding for renewables and nuclear is required.
We have allocated over EUR 1 billion for nuclear funding and nowhere near the equivalent for renewable energy.
This again is completely unacceptable to our citizens.
If we are not to have a conflict between science and society, which the Commissioner has been very anxious to avoid, we will need to revise these priorities.
For example, proposals on fusion are out of date.
Both the US and Japan are pulling out of this research completely.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a very important text, the substance of which will not only determine how the European Union applies research in practice, it will also set the tone for guidelines and practices in all the Member States, especially those like Greece which, to all intents and purposes, have no national research programme of their own.
One of the weak points identified in research in the European Union is its poor application and yet the European Commission's proposed overall budget does not respond to the need for a bold increase in funding and, unfortunately, the Committee on Industry, despite proposing research activities, has not increased the budget.
A second important point is orientation.
The draft before us leaves little room for free research which may not bring in results which can be directly applied in practice but which helps to increase our knowledge and acts as a basis for future applications.
This being so, we feel that the Committee on Industry's proposal to reduce expenditure on so-called priority 8 is not a move in the right direction.
This does not, of course, mean that we disagree with the seven thematic priorities proposed.
The third major issue is who is to benefit from funding.
The structure of the proposed programme is such that it benefits companies, both directly and indirectly, because the guidelines are tailored to their needs.
In our view, corporate research should be funded from company profits, not the public purse.
We are also afraid that small research teams will have trouble finding funding, although the Committee on Industry's amendments will help here.
One comment on the Euratom programme: whatever our reservations about the safety of nuclear fission, we need to be equally hopeful that the continuing debate will provide a long-term solution to the energy supply problem.
From this point of view, I welcome the fact that the Committee on Industry has recommended an increase in funding for the ITER reactor.
Finally, what worries me is that the so-called ethical issue has become much more important than it deserves and has even had a disorientating effect.
Public funding for research is no way to resolve this sort of problem.
It would be a serious oversight on my part if I failed to thank Commissioner Busquin and his staff and, of course, our rapporteur, Mr Caudron, and all the shadow rapporteurs on their tremendous work.
Mr President, Mr Caudron and Mrs McNally both mentioned the fight against AIDS, TB and malaria.
EUR 400 million have been set aside for this purpose, but the money appears in the budget under 'integration of European research' in Amendment No 339.
Could the Commission please tell me whether this means that the money can only be spent in Europe or whether it is possible to use this money to finance the pan-African malaria vaccine-testing network, which, unlike the EU, is ready to test the malaria vaccine now?
If the EUR 400 million can only be spent in Europe, can the Commission tell me whether mainstreaming will make it possible to fund the African network?
If not, I would urge Mr Van Velzen to reconsider accepting an oral amendment to Amendment No 339, which would place the EUR 400 million under international activities.
We are discussing a research programme which will end in 2006.
By then, if we do not finance the pan-African network, more than 400 million people may have died in sub-Saharan Africa and in other poor countries, and more than 50 years of development policy efforts are likely to be ruined by then.
This is extremely important, so even if Mr Van Velzen does not support this oral amendment, I hope that the plenary will.
Thank you, Mr President, and I should also like to thank the rapporteur. The Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development is of crucial importance for the Member States and for the Union as a whole.
Research ought to be aimed at development.
This is how we must follow up the declarations made at the Lisbon European Council. We were charged with turning the European Union into the most dynamic and successful economy in the world, whilst also aiming at full employment.
After all, what use would research be if we did not make that our common aim? In my view, the preparation and adoption of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development provides the ideal opportunity to implement this conclusion of the Lisbon Summit and to give substance to the European Charter for small enterprises.
Enterprises play an important role in disseminating scientific innovation. I am therefore delighted that substantial resources, substantial compared to the immense requirements of other areas, have been devoted to growing businesses, especially small businesses and craft industries.
We must support and encourage research and innovation in SMEs, and also facilitate access to the best technologies, including those of the traditional sector too. It will then be possible for the enterprises to respond to the challenge of full employment.
I should, however, like to refer in particular to the biotechnology industry, to which we must pay special attention because it is involved with the science of living beings.
Regardless of the stage of its development, no human being, whether an embryo or an adult, should ever be used as material with which to treat another human being.
Funding research into embryo stem cells or supernumerary embryos would be contrary to the principle of human dignity. This principle is affirmed in several of the founding texts of the European Union and more recently, in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Furthermore, such research is now no longer required because encouraging results have been obtained through the use of adult stem cells to treat incurable diseases.
Mr President, in line with Lisbon and Stockholm Summit declarations and with the report of this Parliament on the future of the biotech industry, the life sciences are a top priority of the Sixth Framework Programme.
This priority is upheld in Mr Caudron's excellent report.
Parliament must continue to be consistent and add its support to the progress which our scientists and researchers can provide.
Yet as representatives of the people of Europe, we in this Parliament must also define the limits which will provide an appropriate ethical context for this progress.
Genetic research promises much in preventing and curing many of man's most dreaded hereditary diseases.
But genetic engineering for this purpose must not extend into eugenics.
Embryo research must not lead to the deliberate creation of embryos for research, though we may accept that early stage supernumerary embryos genuinely resulting from in-vitro fertilisation, from spontaneous miscarriages or from therapeutic abortions for the mother's health, and which are destined for destruction in any case, can legitimately and ethically be available for research in Member States where there is strict regulation and supervision.
The amendment submitted by Mr Trakatellis, Mr Nisticò and myself - No 333 - seeks to restrict and define more exactly than the existing text where these limits lie.
I commend it to the Parliament.
Mr President, I will start by saying something about money.
The EUR 17.5 billion are in my view insufficient, above all when you consider the ambitious goals that Europeans are always setting themselves.
It is certainly far too little when you consider the imminent enlargement of the European Union.
These funds are one day to be invested for 25 or even more Member States, and that is not enough.
That, though, is how things are these days.
I hope in any case that the Council will approve at least these EUR 17.5 billion, or else, and here I agree with Mr van Velzen, there will be trouble.
European research policy is very much seen in terms of participation in the research programmes.
I want to vigorously urge the Commission to do everything possible to make the submission of applications and their processing easier, so that the researchers can spend their time on real research rather than on filling in forms.
My third observation is on fusion.
We wrangle about this over and over again, and I respect the different opinions that are held on the subject.
The only thing I cannot accept is that this research will not bear fruit for a very long time.
We urge the young to start early on providing for old age, even though, from a young person's point of view, old age is a long, long way away.
We are talking here about the same sort of provision.
Whether a fusion power station is eventually built or not, is for those who come after us to decide.
We should, however, give them the option.
I have always considered it very important that the European Union should concern itself with highly sensitive questions that had formerly been beyond our scope, for example, new methods of detecting and removing landmines.
It is fortunate that we have had a programme of this sort within the European Union for a number of years, and it has achieved noteworthy successes.
My heartfelt plea is that this programme should be continued, ambitiously developed and coordinated, if possible, by a single office within the Commission.
I am thinking here of the Joint Research Centre, whose achievements to date deserve to be highlighted.
An attempt is similarly being made, incidentally, to involve European Union research in the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, be they nuclear, biological or chemical.
I would remind you that the Commission will be making a statement this afternoon about the banning of biological weapons, which has to do with the fight against terrorism.
In the former Soviet Union, today, there are still enormous stockpiles of biological and chemical agents that cannot be destroyed for lack of the necessary funds and often also of the necessary technology.
This is an opportunity for the European Union to do something for the security of Europe and of the world.
As far as bioethics is concerned, I urge support for the proposal by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which simply takes account of the different understandings of the law on this subject in the Member States, and we as European legislators cannot supplant the Member States on this point.
Such a respect for sovereignty is reflected in this proposal.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to endorse the congratulations and words of thanks to Mr Caudron.
Mr Busquin, the Sixth Framework Programme has the great ambition of establishing a European Research Area, and I truly hope that the small, yet excellent, research teams which we even have in the more peripheral regions will be able to play a role in this.
In European research, we must take a step forward both qualitatively and quantitatively speaking.
Female researchers must have a part to play in this and in the next few years, forge ahead to take up leading positions in the research programme.
Research which attempts to solve the mysteries of life remains important. That is not only applied research, but also fundamental research.
There is no doubt that bio-genetics will create new opportunities in future in the fight against incurable diseases, such as Alzheimer' s, Parkinson' s and some forms of cancer.
Within the parameters set out in the Caudron report, particularly in Amendment No 22, and under strict ethical supervision, including that of parliaments, we are of the view that it must be possible to finance stem cell research within the Member States' legal framework.
It is of the utmost importance for us to outline this ethical framework and for the European Parliament and the Member State parliaments to follow the developments in this field, for we must avoid at all cost that everything is allowed for some, as long as it is commercially viable, while nothing is allowed for others.
We must be led by our conscience to jointly outline this framework, even if we fail to see eye to eye on this matter.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the Italian radical members unreservedly support the Caudron report and congratulate the rapporteur on bringing such a difficult and significant task to a successful conclusion. The task is significant because it opens new horizons for European research.
This is sorely needed, because our research is stagnating, our continent and our Union are not at the cutting edge. By this, I mean scientific research and research in many other essential fields, not only scientific progress, but also employment, which are beneficial to the economy and to the progress of human kind.
From this perspective, we are particularly pleased with the position adopted by the Committee on Industry regarding research into human genetics. Tremendous progress has been made everywhere and more is being achieved every day.
Researchers and scientists are working away in laboratories. They are responsible individuals, not at all unbalanced, as many believe.
They hope very soon to make it possible for untold millions of human beings to escape a dreadful fate. These people would then be able to resume a normal life and regain their dignity as human beings.
Diseases such as Alzheimer' s, Parkinson' s, diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease constitute vast research areas still to be explored. I have in mind stem cell research in particular.
The Caudron report presents us with this new challenge, which is dealt with in depth.
Since Galileo, ever since time began in fact, scientific progress has always challenged the established order. Indeed, given that it ushers in a new order, the one previously in place is bound to collapse.
Nonetheless, certain Members of this House have voiced their opposition to all this. They are trying to prevent what I believe is obvious progress.
In any case, even if Parliament rules against the report, progress will continue.
Clearly, millions and millions of human beings are at risk and threatened with death. There is, however, a strong chance that these new technologies could produce cures or improved treatments.
This is why I say yes to the Caudron report, yes to the hope that European research may rise to the challenge presented by the United States and other world economies. With this in mind, we should invest in European research capable of taking our values to even greater heights.
Our scientists must be allowed to work in the most promising domain possible, namely embryo stem cell research. Frankly speaking, this is the issue which will very shortly highlight the rift between us.
Ladies and gentlemen, the future is at stake here.
It cannot be held up because it is already upon us.
Sooner or later it will overcome.
Mr President, I want first to express my thanks for the exciting, inspiring and business-like work in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
It has been a delight to participate in the work on the framework programme.
I also want to thank Commissioner Busquin for the way in which he began the discussion with new ideas about the European Research Area.
I have seen how the ideas floated by the Commissioner have taken root in the countries of the EU and created a new dynamic of a kind we had not known before and which I would to a large extent ascribe to the Commissioner' s initiative.
I am very pleased about the opportunities under the framework programme also to involve countries which do not directly receive aid from the European Union, for example, even Iran and Taiwan can participate, to cite two extremes, if the countries themselves pay and if we find that they add value to the programmes.
That means exchanges involving young people in areas that are important for the future.
It provides the opportunity for new creativity and new understanding within research, something that will be very valuable, especially in the world of today.
With regard to nuclear research, I believe that Europe should promote this in areas which can contribute to our actively participating in the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, weapons grade plutonium, etc.
We have facilities. We have knowledge that can be made use of.
The international mood today is such that there is now a possibility of having these things destroyed.
Let us make sure that they are destroyed, and allow Europe to take part in their destruction.
Finally, I hope that the Commissioner, together with his Director-General, will take the lead when it comes to the simplification that is necessary if small and medium-sized companies, together with university departments, are happily able to participate in the programme without experiencing financial difficulties.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for the Sixth Research Framework Programme is an ethical minefield.
Amendment No 22, providing for Community funds for embryo research, is utterly unacceptable, being a flagrant offence against human dignity.
Embryos must not be degraded to the level of being research material.
Embryo research is banned in four Member States, including Germany.
We must not permit the use of Community funds to finance something that is punishable in these Member States.
Even research on embryo stem cells would offer an incentive to create even more surplus embryos, and we decisively reject it for that reason.
The proposal even offers support to germline therapy.
This would mean the European Parliament distancing itself, politically and scientifically, from the rest of the world, for nobody in the scientific community is demanding or promoting germline therapy, far from it, they are calling for it to be outlawed.
So I ask you to let us clear these ethical mines from the research framework programme and make the programme we adopt a responsible one.
Mr President, first of all I too should like to thank Commissioner Busquin and the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, for the excellent work that has been done with a view to the approval of this Sixth Research Framework Programme.
This document is, I believe, so excellent and innovative that it is almost a sin that the debate in Parliament should concentrate on ethics and the use of stem cells, important though that issue may be, while losing sight of all the novel, highly significant elements present in this Sixth Framework Programme.
I believe that identifying the eight priority thematic areas for research is an innovative, important and positive idea; there is, however, a danger that small and medium-sized European enterprises might be excluded from the identification of areas structurally more suited to large businesses.
Mr Caudron' s proposal of the instrument of the stairways of excellence seems to me to be a valid compromise, and I therefore agree with it, although I still ask the Commission and the Commissioner always to pay the greatest attention to the requirements of small and medium-sized enterprises.
The danger that European research funds might end up being monopolised by large companies, which, by definition, are those that perhaps need them least since they patently already have the capacity to propose and run research programmes, is still very real.
If, however, we wish to build that knowledge-based society that was sketched out in Lisbon, research must permeate our whole society and therefore impinge, first of all, on small and medium-sized European enterprises.
Lastly, to conclude, a remark on the Euratom programme: I agree with the appropriations proposed in the report; we need to give the green light to the ITER project, which must not, however, be confused with the nuclear power schemes we know today.
Here we are talking about research and the future of clean energy.
Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Commissioner Busquin for his extraordinary commitment and for the enthusiasm he has managed to raise in the European Parliament for the creation of a European Research Area.
I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Van Velzen and Mrs McNally, for their contributions and the respect they have shown towards those individual Members who have sought to improve this framework programme with their amendments.
The text originally proposed by the Commission has been considerably supplemented and rejigged, now both specifying more clearly the research priorities in Europe in the various sectors and rejigging the initial financial architecture.
With regard to the biomedical sector, I must express my satisfaction with the EUR 500 million increase given to biomedicine, not just for genome and post-genome research but for all research aimed at adding to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms at the basis of diseases as well.
I should like once again to affirm a fundamental idea already expressed by Mr Trakatellis, which is that no research in Europe can be more important or deserve greater priority than that which concerns people' s health and their physical and mental suffering.
That is why I now ask Commissioner Busquin, on behalf of the whole scientific community and of a number of Nobel prize-winners, such as my friend Renato Dulbecco, Rita Levi Montalcini and John Vane, to maintain this increase in funding for biomedical research for the next five years.
Through scientific research we can at last, thanks to new technologies, combat terrible, hitherto incurable diseases such as cancer, AIDS, Alzheimer' s, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, heart disease and so on, not least by using advanced technologies, as specified, for instance, in the Trakatellis, Purvis and Nisticò amendment, which embodies a good balance that should gain the consensus of the whole House.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking Gérard Caudron for his difficult work.
As we might say in German, it is easier to guard a sack of fleas than draw together the different interests in this House, and I would therefore like to express my sincere thanks for his successful efforts in this regard.
With the research framework programme, we want to make a contribution to enhancing the competitiveness of European industry.
We want to underpin and support our European policies through research.
However, we also want to bring research closer to citizens.
I am pleased, therefore, that in this latter area, we have been able to make some improvement to the Commission's proposal through three important steps.
As part of this process, it is important, in my view, for us to ensure that research complies with the principle of sustainable development as set out in Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Gothenburg Council Conclusions.
We must bring ecological criteria into line with social and economic criteria, and so it is only right and proper that research should be subject to this principle too.
This is reflected in a number of the amendments relating to energy and sustainable transport.
I also think it is important, and necessary, to interconnect research and society, firstly by examining every research project to determine the effect of research on society: in other words, by carrying out technology impact assessments, and secondly, by actively including citizens in the research dialogue and strengthening this dialogue between research and society.
It is only right and proper, in my view, for us to increase the available resources in this area.
The third building block to bring research closer to citizens is undoubtedly to enhance the opportunities available to SMEs, universities and small research institutions for participation in this process, as they, of course, offer great potential for innovation, and many people, many Europeans, are involved.
We must therefore ensure that the processes are simple, transparent and speedy, and above all, that those who are rejected also receive a response which signals that researchers are taken seriously.
If we are able to realise these three dimensions: sustainability, dialogue between research and society, and an effective approach to SMEs, then, I am sure, research will find a place not only in the minds of Europeans, but also in their hearts.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to begin by thanking the Commissioner for his outstanding work.
Of course, I would also like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Caudron, for his two excellent reports.
I would like to express my appreciation of the positive and constructive cooperation within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy as well.
I too found this a very enjoyable experience, thanks, not least, to the sterling work carried out by our shadow rapporteur.
I would like to raise two issues.
Firstly, genetic research: genetic and biotechnology offer great opportunities in medicine and the environment, and it is certainly right to give massive support to these areas at European level.
However, as soon as human embryos become the subject of research, I believe that for ethical reasons, clear limits must be set.
Some Member States, including Germany, have banned the use of human embryos for research purposes, and this naturally includes associated activities such as the cloning of human life.
I think that our consideration and respect for other Member States make it incumbent on us to exclude activities which obviously raise serious issues of ethical responsibility from joint European research funding, and I therefore urge this House to vote for Mr Posselt's Amendment No 334 or Mr Liese's Amendment No 332.
The second issue which I would like to address briefly is fusion research.
I wish to voice my clear support for the funding of fusion research.
I believe that nuclear fusion can be developed as a future-proof technology.
It produces virtually no carbon dioxide emissions which impact on climate.
It also produces very little in the way of radioactive waste, and in particular, in contrast to nuclear fission, has no significant harmful effects over the long term.
In this respect, we Europeans should take the opportunity afforded in this area, in which we have a unique status worldwide - to continue appropriate research. We should not cut the budget but leave it, at least, at the level originally proposed.
Mr President, as someone who suffers from a neurological complaint, to wit Parkinson's disease, I am naturally biased in this matter, but I am a little shocked by the frequent use of terms like 'unacceptable' and 'dignity' applied to people who wish to find a solution through medical research to the terrible problems facing those who suffer from neurological disease, such as Alzheimer's, motor neurone and Parkinson's.
There is no dignity in dying of motor neurone disease and there is precious little dignity in suffering from Parkinson's either.
So I want to commend to the House the view of the sufferer as well as the view - if there is to be one - of the person who is concerned above all about preserving the embryo.
If I thought that an embryo had the same human rights as a child or an adult human being, I would not, of course, not be in favour of anything that meant the destruction of human life.
But the laws of our Member States by and large accept that there is a difference between an embryo, a fertilised egg and an adult or child who is already a human being.
The human rights of the one are not quite the same as the human rights of the other.
That is what the law says in most of our Member States.
I do not believe that the founder of the Christian religion, who set great store by healing the sick, would inhibit those who simply want to cure sick people.
I cannot believe that this is the intention of the Christian ethic.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin, of course, by congratulating the rapporteur Mr Caudron.
I know from experience how much work is involved in bringing a framework programme to a conclusion, at least in draft form.
We will now formally adopt this programme today or tomorrow.
It is a time for great words, and great words are needed.
I would also like to take this opportunity to express my thanks for the cooperation with the Commission.
Paper does not blush, however.
We will have a good programme, but the work is only just beginning.
What are we going to do with all these objectives set out on paper?
How will we achieve these goals?
At the moment, this is written not so much in the stars as in the heads of the civil servants or, indeed, the Commissioner.
We therefore urgently need more precise details of this entire project.
We urgently need the specific programmes.
That is the first point.
We also urgently need further cooperation with the Commission if these specific programmes have to be amended by this House.
The second point is this: there is no sense in allocating EUR 17, 18, 16 billion - the figure has not yet been finally decided - if these funds are not used where they are most needed, that is, in the universities, in industry, and in the SMEs.
It is therefore vital to ensure that the rules governing participation in this framework programme are practicable, in line with the realities of the research world, and meet the needs of companies seeking to develop their innovations on the basis of this funding.
After all, we should not forget that research and innovation are not ends in themselves.
The purpose of research and innovation is to bring products to market and improve our competitiveness.
This can only be achieved if there are significant levels of participation, if the allocation instruments are transparent, and if everyone, from Finland to Sicily and Greece, knows what his or her position is.
The real work therefore starts here, not only for the Commission staff but also for us.
After the framework programme means before the next framework programme, but, above all, it means during implementation.
This House must therefore look very closely to determine how much continuity exists between the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programmes, how reliable the instruments used by the Commission are, and how this money is spent.
We will also carry out an ex post audit.
Thank you very much. I look forward to further years of cooperation.
Mr President, I am in favour of research.
We all want to find cures for illness and I am sure that in each of our families we have personally experienced the sadness of incurable disease.
Over the past year in the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics and Other New Technologies we discussed various ways of finding answers to these medical problems.
We voted last week to support the funding of uncontroversial stem-cell research using placenta, umbilical cord and adult stem cells.
We voted with cross-party support to ban funding of research resulting in the destruction of human embryos, any kind of cloning, the use of surplus embryos and germline intervention.
The majority, therefore, in the temporary committee, whose aim it was to draw up ethical guidelines for the European Union, rejects the research funding suggested in the Caudron report.
EU funding should not be promoted for controversial research, banned in four Member States, my own country included.
Respect for the dignity of the human person is a fundamental principle upheld in all European and international agreements.
I urge that we do not desert this principle.
Many citizens, myself included, believe that there is a more acceptable, ethical and moral way forward than the one which leads us to destroy one innocent human life in order to cure another.
I urge you to reject the funding suggested in the Caudron report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, research policy is one of the areas in which we clearly need more involvement by Europe.
Munich is one of the most modern locations for research in the European Union, and Franz Josef Strauss set a course 30 years ago which has ensured that there is still an aerospace industry today.
As a location for research, Munich has never suffered from the fact that research policy has always set clear ethical limits.
On the contrary, these clear ethical limits include banning research on embryo stem cells, the import of embryo stem cells and the creation of embryos for research purposes, for such techniques are nothing but cannibalism.
Even if human life is saved through the killing of other human life, I believe this is ethically unacceptable.
It is cannibalism.
I am delighted that in all its decisions since 1988, since the Ghergo report, the European Parliament has adhered to this position by a clear majority and that the German Bundestag's Study Commission adopted this line, also with a clear majority, on Monday evening, referring in this context to the Fiori report which we adopted last week by a substantial majority in our Committee on Human Genetics.
I think it would be most regrettable if this important, high-quality research framework programme were associated with any attempt to undermine the European Parliament's clear ethical line on embryo protection and the protection of human life.
I urge to you to vote for the Scallon/Posselt amendment, and if this is not adopted, to support the Liese/Fiori compromise amendment and reject all the other amendments on this issue.
The European Parliament's reputation is at stake: a reputation associated with its position, for more than 10 years, at the forefront of those who strive to protect human life.
Mr President, the sixth framework research programme is a serious and fundamental attempt by the European Union to achieve its strategic objectives, that is, to become the most competitive knowledge-economy based area in the world over the next ten years.
It will also help it to benefit from progress being made in other corners of the world, while helping it to contribute towards the development of mankind.
We all have to meet this challenge, at both European and national level.
This means bold funding for research in all sectors, coordinating research at European level, in contrast to the current fragmentary approach, and disseminating it throughout the economic and social fabric.
Our success in achieving our political and development objectives will depend directly on how we use the results of research for the benefit of the health and quality of life of our citizens, full employment and social cohesion.
I should like to focus on the need for research in the social sector.
Our development depends first and foremost on the viability of our social model.
The social agenda which we have adopted and are currently applying is the basis for this policy.
Economic and social change has led our economy and society into an impasse.
Ageing, widespread poverty and social exclusion, large numbers of accidents at work, the need to successfully integrate large groups of citizens such as the Roma, the need to integrate the disabled into the job market, the constant need to help women enter the job market, new risks to employees' health and our increasingly multicultural society in Europe are such that we need scientific research on which to base our policy over coming years.
This will encourage European countries with no tradition of social research, which are the very countries which face the worst development problems.
Finally, I should like to stress the need for public information and consultation on all our research objectives.
Research in all sectors, from biotechnology to social research, is carried out a long way from the ground, in closed laboratories or study firms.
Our citizens are unable to read the articles not just in scientific journals, but also in the broadsheets.
We need to make an effort to ensure that information is provided on a systematic basis.
Mr President, the report and the framework programme have been extensively modified since they were first presented to this Parliament.
Citizens should be aware of this extensive transformation, so that they can see the good cooperation between the institutions.
I think that this is due, to a large extent, to Mr Caudron' s flexibility and capacity to listen, and this is also true of rapporteurs from other political parties, such as Mr Van Velzen, who has been listening throughout and welcoming the amendments and various suggestions from all Members.
I have never worked in a committee where all requests have been treated in this way and incorporated.
I would like this spirit to be maintained throughout the implementation process, because it is clear that this is a European project that needs to continue growing and expanding.
I also have to say that this journey has been carried out on the basis of a policy that aims to reduce work, reduce the work of the committee and to create fewer projects, but larger ones, and Parliament has been able to break down this centrality with regard to large projects, large companies and various research programmes that are essentially covering work that on many occasions is quasi-public with regard to the large research centres or large industries, such as the aeronautical industry.
Parliament has been able to open this project up in more directions, extending its range of priorities to territories that, up until now, were not covered or that were not considered important.
There are various innovations which citizens should be aware of: one of these, the most important one in my opinion, is the introduction of a fourth instrument.
Introducing a fourth instrument means opening the door to smaller projects, facilitating the entry of SMEs and making the European Research Area a possibility, for Europe comprises many small States and Research Centres.
The average European team has no more than six people, whilst an American team consists of 24 people.
Europe needs protection measures and incentives that are suited to its dimensions.
Europe is still a collection of individual initiatives.
For this very reason, the escalier d' excellence seems to be very effectively set out in Amendment No 305.
We have also introduced important aspects of relevance to culture.
Cultural heritage belongs to the world of non-renewable resources.
When the tomb of a mediaeval King disappears, with its costumes and clothing, or when we lose track of a wrecked ship at the bottom of the sea, new technologies have to be used to recover these relics.
Architecture, engineering, the structure of buildings, are all in the realm of science.
We have supported the safeguarding of cultural heritage and we think that the European Union should also continue to do so.
Thank you for your speech, Commissioner Busquin.
I believe everybody here would like to thank you just as warmly for the very proper manner in which you have conducted your relations with our institution.

Mr President, since the Commissioner has now indicated that he will be adopting so many of Parliament' s amendments, I have one pertinent question for the Commissioner. Does that also mean that you will now first be fine-tuning the specific programmes which you have drafted earlier before they can be discussed in Parliament?
Obviously, it follows that in the next few days specific programmes will be adjusted to bring them into line with any amendments adopted.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
EU/Latin America relations
The next item is the report (A5-0336/2001) by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on a global partnership and a common strategy for relations between the European Union and Latin America [2000/2249(INI)].
Mr President, on a point of order, I would like to bring to your attention, and I hope this will not take up part of my speaking time, that I have received no news relating to the absence of the Commissioner responsible, Mr Patten.
I was wondering whether the presidency had received any news of his absence and if it could provide any information.
I cannot see the Commissioner here, which is very strange because he always comes to debates on foreign policy when he can.
I would like to know whether the presidency or the Commission have any information that justifies, as will surely be the case, the absence of the Commissioner responsible, Mr Patten.
Mr Salafranca, from the point of view of the presidency I cannot answer your question.
The Commission is, however, present in the person of Commissioner Bolkenstein, who will, of course, speak on behalf of the Commission at the end of the debate.
I do not know whether Commissioner Bolkenstein intends to answer your question straight away.
Commissioner.
Mr President, my colleague, Mr Patten, is at present in New York attending the General Assembly of the United Nations.
I hope that Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra will take this as sufficient apology for his absence and that he will be happy with the answers I give him and other Members in the debate that follows.
I shall certainly do my best.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkenstein.
I think Mr Salafranca, like the rest of us, has been given a clear and satisfactory answer.

Mr President, I would like to thank both yourself and also Mr Bolkestein for his kindness and his cooperation. I naturally understand the reasons he has given for Mr Patten' s absence.
As you all know, the Heads of State and Government of the European Union, some time ago, in June 1999, decided to form a strategic global partnership between the European Union and Latin America.
More than two years have passed since that date and the truth of the matter is that we have to admit that no great progress has been made in reaching this objective set by the Heads of State and Government.
This, Mr President, is precisely the reason why the European Parliament has wanted not only to discuss, but also to adopt an own-initiative report in order to add fuel to the debate on the next summit, the second of the Heads of State and Government, which will take place next spring, and present a document that could offer a strategic vision with regard to these relations, in order that the European Union will not arrive at this summit empty handed, at least with regard to the responsibility of our institution.
I would like, in the first instance, to praise the spirit of cooperation that the political groups have shown me during the production of this report, which has been approved by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy by an overwhelming majority (48 votes for, 0 against and 2 abstentions).
I would also like to thank the committees who were asked to give their opinion for their cooperation.
In this report, Mr President, we are asking for something of fundamental importance: that is that, just as the European Union has a common strategy for relations with Russia, with the Balkans, with non-EU countries in the Mediterranean or with the Ukraine, it should also have a common strategy for relations with the countries of Latin America.
This strategy, Mr President, in my opinion, should involve three aspects: in the political sphere, a revision and updating of the biregional agenda; secondly, a renewal and updating of political dialogue at ministerial level; and thirdly, the constitution of a transatlantic, Euro-Latin American assembly, through the signing of a Euro-Latin American charter for peace and the implementation of a Euro-Latin American political and security partnership.
In the economic, financial and commercial field, Mr President, we think that the European Union should complete the agreements that are currently under negotiation with Mercosur and Chile.
These agreements need to be concluded in a balanced fashion and, naturally, as quickly as possible, depending on their own merits.
We think that there can be no distinction, at least from the European Union' s point of view, between first- or second-class countries or groups of countries.
For this reason, we are asking the Commission, in the medium term, to put forward some negotiation guidelines with the aim of reaching new agreements with the Andean Community and with the countries in Central America.
I am talking, Commissioner, about the short and medium term, given that in the short term we believe, here in the European Parliament, that the facilities granted by the Community Generalised System of Preferences have to be maintained.
In the same respect, Mr President, we are asking for the implementation of a global interregional association agreement that can give institutional support and total geographical coverage in relations with the subcontinent, in order, amongst other things, not to be second rate when compared with the developments that are being made in the United States.
We are also requesting the creation of an area of shared prosperity through the strengthening of regional markets between now and the year 2010.
I would like to add, Mr President, that it is a shame that there should only be one country in Latin America which, although we have diplomatic relations with it and apply the Community Generalised System of Preferences to it, is not linked to the European Union by means of an agreement.
I am, naturally, referring to Cuba.
For this reason I think that - in the spirit of the doctrine of the European Union in general and in the spirit previously adopted by this Parliament in the Newens report in particular, we should seek a formula which, within the framework of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, would allow us to progress in order to find an institutional formula in our relations with this country.
In the social and cultural field, Mr President, we are proposing an emphatic and ambitious development cooperation policy in the social, culture, education, emigration, internal affairs and justice fields, with a whole series of concrete initiatives, that I will not explain here right now for lack of time.
Mr President, I believe, and I think that my fellow Members believe the same, that the commitments made at the Rio Summit and the whole strategy formulated around the new commitment with Latin America should take shape as quickly as possible and give a strong impetus to relations with this region, although this should not be done to the detriment of economic sectors and the civil society.
The next summit of Heads of State and Government will have to result, in our opinion, in a palpable success, sending a clear message with regard to this new European commitment with Latin America.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra on his clear and comprehensive report.
It is indeed time for the European Union to revise its strategy on relations with Latin America.
There is still a great deal of room for improvement, especially in the field of economic cooperation, and for us Socialists, this also includes Cuba, a country with which we must finally commence negotiations on a framework agreement, without any preconditions.
Economic cooperation must include and take account of appropriate social and ecological minimum standards; after all, we do not want to worsen the social inequalities in Latin America but help to defuse them, for these countries are still marked by massive variations in social conditions.
There are wealthy industrialised enclaves surrounded by regions with crippling poverty.
We therefore also call, in the field of structural development, for measures to achieve sustainable economic development which promote SMEs in particular.
Above all, wherever it is necessary and appropriate, the groups concerned and civil society, especially indigenous ethnic groups, must be included from the planning stage onwards.
This applies especially to the Puebla Panama project.
The European Union should only participate in this project on the basis of clearly defined substantive agreements.
Technology and knowledge transfer, but also the opening of the European market to the partner countries' products, are further steps which must be taken quickly.
This House wants an equal economic partnership with the citizens of Latin America, not just with a handful of major corporations.
Mr President, the terrorist attacks of 11 September have finally brought it home to us that global crises have global consequences and that the European Union can no longer afford any eurocentrism.
This does not mean downgrading the importance of EU enlargement and the stabilisation of the Balkans; it simply means that the Rio process must not suffer the same fate as the Barcelona process or the policies on the Mediterranean.
It should not take a terrorist attack for us to give relations with these marginal areas of Europe or the Latin American region, a region which has strong historical and demographic links with Europe, the attention they deserve.
The European Parliament's own-initiative report by Mr Salafranca is therefore timely, coming as it does in advance of the Rio follow-up summit in Madrid in May next year.
We need to develop a strategy and give greater priority to our policies on Latin America at every level in order to combat poverty on this continent, consolidate democracy, tackle organised crime and drug trafficking, and, finally, to protect our economic interests.
The conclusion of the association agreement with Mexico has had a positive impact on the European business presence in that country, which has benefited both sides.
The association agreement with Chile will, we hope, be signed in Madrid in May.
Unfortunately, the negotiations with Mercosur are not progressing as smoothly. I hope that in this context, the Commission and the European Parliament will do their utmost to overcome the hurdles concerning Argentina and Brazil.
Free trade is not a one-way street, and more or less concealed protectionism should be a thing of the past.
We must also increase awareness of the Latin American region.
The establishment of a Centre for European and Latin American Studies would be a welcome step.
What Latin America needs, however, are not only association agreements but general strategies to promote an investment-friendly climate, and this can only be achieved if there is political stability and an end to capital flight.
Not every dollar earned should be transferred directly to Miami.
Mr President, the Salafranca report comes at an opportune moment.
The implementation of a global partnership and common strategy with Latin America, driven by Europe, is something that has always been worthwhile, but now more than ever, since 11 September, when international relations are clearly in a state of upheaval.
This strategy and partnership driven by Europe comes at a time when a partner, in a different region, is going through difficult times, of which we are all aware.
However, as Europeans, we should have clearly defined ideas.
The partner to which I am referring will get through its bad patch over time and will once again turn its attention to Latin America.
It has a right to do this, but Europe has values and interests that are not always the same as those of the United States.
We only have to mention the mere existence of Mercosur or Alca or, simply, the different positions we maintain with regard to areas such as the death penalty or the Permanent Court of International Justice.
With regard to the objectives of the common strategy that have been mentioned, it is laudable, of course, to aim for the implementation of a Euro-Latin American area of peace and stability, in addition to the signing of a peace charter, a task that in my opinion would be difficult to achieve, but not as difficult as reaching equivalent objectives, such as those sought by the Barcelona process for Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, whose execution has not so far made it possible to solve the Middle East conflict.
On the other hand, I applaud the intention of sharing prosperity through the creation of a free trade area by 2010, or thereabouts.
However, I would like to allude once more to the Barcelona process in order to warn that the process that we are hoping to achieve for Latin America should take account of inequalities, that is to say, the different economic weight of the partners, because this could lead to trade being free for all, in theory, but, in practice, being subjected to the most onerous of burdens, that is to say, true inequality that as we all know can be widespread throughout Latin America.
This could mean that our supposed free trade will become nothing more than a slogan.
So, if our intention is to create a partnership between members who are supposed to be equal, when it is obvious that they are not, it is important that we can resort to a fundamental instrument.
I am referring to a genuine development cooperation policy, which is the only thing that can minimise, although I fear this will not happen before 2010, the enormous socioeconomic differences that exist today between the European Union and Latin America and even between Latin American partners themselves.
Lastly, I would like to remind the ultra-liberals that not only is development aid compatible with free trade, but that it requires it, except when free trade is understood to be solely based upon cynical and even cruel inequalities.
On occasions, decent trade is not possible without efficient and transparent development cooperation providing the basis for a free, but fair, game.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only express my hearty congratulations to Mr Salafranca on the thorough work he has done.
It is true that to give real substance to all that was decided in Rio de Janeiro by the first Summit between Heads of State and Government of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, the solemn declarations must be made concrete by transforming them into facts, strategies and opportunities that can give new life to the dialogue between the European Union and Latin America.
We should not be surprised, then, that the Salafranca report states firmly that the only way the European Union can establish a genuine, bi-regional strategic partnership is to launch a new joint strategy with force and determination, and that the best time to do so may be precisely at the Madrid Summit in May 2002.
It is right, therefore, to lay the foundations straight away and to find the simplest instruments that can be most readily understood by the citizens of both the European Union and South America.
The creation of a single EU-Latin American Transatlantic Assembly will be most welcome; it must have the broadest remit, including, particularly, the fight against poverty and social exclusion, and the fight against drugs and organised crime, and it must also focus greatly on the basic sector of education, culture and free trade which, as the previous speaker pointed out, must come about without generating inequalities.
The strategy, as the rapporteur suggests, could be one of a single bi-regional solidarity fund, clearly identified and thus more easily controlled.
But apart from the technical financial instruments, what is fundamental is that there should be clear political will, that we should take on a greater burden, that the Union can and must commit itself to implementing a strong development cooperation policy.
The historical, cultural and blood ties that link so many Europeans to Latin America mean that whenever one of us is in Latin America, Mr President, we feel at home.
These ties impose a moral as well as a political obligation on us to continue to uphold with renewed vigour the specific nature of Europe' s role, which is based on the strength of those values that have been at the root of our project for integration.
It is also for these reasons that, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, I confirm our full support for this report.
Mr President, the common strategy on Latin America is a strategy that may contain highly novel elements for Europe in this ever more complicated world.
This novelty will be seen in the way the relations between Europe and Latin America are to be organised around three themes: the first is the debate on the rules of the game in the process of globalisation and, particularly, the question of democracy and the reduction of poverty; the second is the question of regional political integration; and the third is the joint management of major environmental crises.
In this sense, although we in our group support the general approach taken by the Salafranca report, it contains a few elements which we believe still reflect a view that does not give enough attention precisely to the novelty of the issues we should be responding to.
In particular, my group strongly questions the emphasis placed on the commercial dimension of relations between Europe and Latin America, especially the need for them to be subject to the current rules of the World Trade Organisation, rules which are widely challenged not only in Latin America but in Europe too.
Secondly, we do not agree with the a priori positive assessment of the Puebla-Panama plan, which is a plan for large infrastructure works which will have considerable social and environmental impact.
Before the European Union joins the financial community in contributing to the success of this plan, as called for in the report, I think we should carefully assess this impact.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate and thank Mr Salafranca for his report, which is very comprehensive, well-written and apt, because it is only when the enlargement process has been completed on paper, that we realise that there are still two issues that have yet to be resolved: Euro-Mediterranean strategy and this matter of Latin America.
And it is precisely Latin America, with its growing organisational process, that offers more possibilities and at the same time has international repercussions that we should view positively.
The influence of the European Union on Latin America within the United Nations in terms of finding peaceful solutions for conflicts, is, my view, a cause for hope, when compared with the militarisation and aggressive use of force practised by the United States at this time.
I think that this issue is both important and appropriate, and Parliament is showing us that we are working in real time.
For this reason and without reservations, our group will be supporting Mr Salafranca' s report.
We do not agree upon certain, very specific, issues, but we will deal with these when the time is right.
We are thinking here of the inclusion of Cuba, which for us is of fundamental importance, and also the choice of a peaceful solution of the Colombian conflict, which is what the European Union wants to see.
Mr President, the countries of Latin America and the European Union have a cultural basis in common, which greatly facilitates the mutual relations between our peoples.
Despite, however, certain promising prospects opened up by the first EU-Latin America-Caribbean Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in 1999, along the lines of a strategic partnership on an economic, social and ecological level, the concrete results so far achieved have been far from satisfactory.
The reasons for this shortcoming are varied in origin and responsibility for it lies in different places.
For the part that lies with us, there seems at times to be a kind of European self-inhibition, perhaps due even to the geo-strategic primacy, and not only that, of the United States throughout the American continent.
As we know, the countries of Latin America are confronted with joining the American free trade area, which may happen from 2005 onwards (so we are nearly there!).
Now that there is a clear need to establish strong partnerships on the international scene, now more than ever, since the end of the Cold War, the European Union must not shirk any of its responsibilities or the challenges placed before it.
One of the most important is precisely that of being able to define coherent joint strategies and endow them with effective political content.
Thus the proposals presented in this own-initiative report by Mr Salafranca, whom we congratulate on his excellent work, deserve all our support. Not only because they explain and list practically all the aspects that have to be taken into consideration in a joint strategy to intensify EU-Latin American relations, but they also deserve our support because they come at just the right time, prior to the preparations for the second Heads of State and Government Summit to be held next May.
Mr President, it seems to me that something is sorely missing from the report we have before us.
I refer of course to the Native Americans, and by that I mean the indigenous peoples of this subcontinent. We tend to overlook them all too often, because they prick our conscience somewhat.
How can we discuss relations with that part of 'Latin' America and fail to refer to these people?
Where it did not wipe them out, our so-called civilisation reduced most of them to poverty.
In its opinion, the Committee on Development and Cooperation has, quite rightly, highlighted this omission.
To take an example, item 50 of paragraph g of the report envisages a financial contribution by the Union to the Puebla Panama plan.
How can such an idea be entertained when the plan covers areas with a majority Native American population, in Chiapas and Guatemala, yet the American Indians have not been consulted?
I would be hard put to vote in favour of this report.
Mr President, the establishment of a common strategy between the European Union and Latin America, as decided in Rio de Janeiro in 1999, is a matter of justice that will finally give the appropriate dimension to interregional relationships that have historically been undervalued.
The Socialist Group in the Committee on Development and Cooperation agrees with the objectives set out in the resolution proposed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, for which I would like to congratulate Mr Salafranca.
In our opinion, we need to increase the content of the political agenda and deepen dialogue at all political and institutional levels, within the framework of a true partnership.
We think that the signing of association agreements with the Andean Community and Central America is necessary, with the aim of creating a Euro-Latin American free trade area.
We also consider, however, that we need to give priority to the resolution of development problems in many Latin American countries, where there are 200 million poor people.
We are particularly concerned about the Andean area, Central America and the Caribbean.
In the Andean area, instability, institutional violence, problems of drug trafficking and the management of migratory flows have to be dealt with from a global perspective, that integrates development cooperation, trade liberalisation, institutional transformation, human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples in particular.
The creation of a Euro-Latin American area of peace and stability has to be founded upon the principles of human rights, democracy and the fight against drug trafficking.
In Central America, aid to social development and the fight against poverty have to take precedence over any other initiative, such as the information society.
To do otherwise would be to put the cart before the horse.
I would also like to make a special reference to the Caribbean and, specifically, to Cuba, as have other Members this morning.
Cuba is not part of the Cotonu Agreement nor does it have an institutionalised relationship with the European Union.
We think that development potential in Cuba, where, for some time, European companies have been investing, and the situation of its people merit treatment from the European Union that goes much further than the indifference it has shown to this country until now.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Salafranca on his magnificent report and also Mr Kreissl-Dörfler for his opinion, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on this subject.
The Salafranca report is, generally speaking, very comprehensive and quite ambitious.
I am only going to make one point, relating to paragraph 60, referring to the need for the Commission and the Council to provide adequate funding; and I would like to relate it to the report presented to us yesterday by the President of the Court of Auditors on economic management in the year 2000.
In this report, in paragraph 5.5.8, something very serious is pointed out: that more than 25% of commitment appropriations allocated to Latin America in the year 2000 could not be used, because of administrative shortcomings.
It was not made very clear in the Court of Auditors report whether administrative shortcomings were restricted to those countries receiving Community aid or the Community' s administration itself.
In response to the Commission, a series of measures have been referred to which would prevent this taking place this year or next, and Mr Salafranca himself refers to another issue, which is the need for extra personnel in the Directorate-General for Latin America.
Some time ago the Director of this Directorate-General told me personally, and I am talking about more than ten years ago, that the Directorate did not need more money, but more staff.
I still have no idea whether this particular bottleneck has yet been resolved.
Finally, one of the proposals put forward by the Commission is to strengthen delegations' decentralisation functions.
I would also like to insist upon something Mr Salafranca has also stressed, which is that a very large country in Latin America with which we have a privileged relationship, Ecuador, still has no delegation, despite previous agreements and commitments made by this Parliament and the Commission itself.
Mr President, in the time available, as Mr Salafranca will understand, I would like to concentrate on paragraph 7 of the resolution on the urgent and overriding need to keep support for the peace process in Colombia as a priority within this strategy.
In particular I want to state two points.
First, that the pledge made by President Pastrana personally to this Parliament on the dismantling of paramilitary groups has not been, and is not being, honoured.
So say the UN special representative on human rights, the Mexican observer commission and the relations of ten fishermen killed in Santa Marta, and of the 18 people forced face down on to the ground and shot dead by paramilitaries in Buga within the last month alone.
This is a continued gross abuse of human rights and, as my own UK ambassador has said, in these troubled times the guerrillas and the paramilitaries are both terrorist groups and should be combated through all means as part of the current anti-terrorist programme.
We feel that particularly due to the killing of the British backpacker Jeremy Parks on 28 October.
The Belgian Presidency rightly included action against paramilitaries as one of its four priorities in Colombia, in August of this year.
Could the Commissioner please tell us in his reply what progress is being made as a result of the pressure that is being applied.
Secondly, we support Commissioner Patten's proposal for a peace laboratory at Magdalena Medio.
It is a major contribution towards the peace process, in contrast to the American military aid in Plan Colombia, which we have roundly condemned.
But this Magdalena Medio region has been subject to an incursion by those same guerrillas.
They are there, threatening campesinos that they must plant coca or they will die.
They are there running their own businesses, having their own taxes and they want to co-opt NGOs to ensure that our European money goes to them to undermine the peace process rather than to support it.
I call on the Commissioner now to show how he will introduce control and verification mechanisms so that our European money will achieve progress in the peace process, and not be abused by the paramilitaries to undermine our very aims.
Welcome
I should like to extend a welcome to a delegation from the Mercosur joint parliamentary commission.
The delegation, headed by its acting president, Mr Washington Abdala, is composed of twelve members of the upper and lower houses of Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil.
During this visit, the delegation members will take part in the fourth interparliamentary meeting between this joint parliamentary commission from Mercosur and the delegation for relations with the countries of South America and Mercosur.
These meetings began in 1996.
Relations between Mercosur and the EU are going through a very important period, since the negotiations for a free trade area have reached their sixth round and are proceeding at a fast pace.
On behalf of the European Parliament, therefore, I welcome this delegation and express this Institution' s support for a profitable outcome to the negotiations.
EU/Latin America relations (continuation)
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra for his excellent report. I should like to express my recognition of the arduous task that he has undertaken, namely to synthesise the different aspects of our relations with Latin America.
This report looks forward in an ambitious effort to give more vitality and further impetus to our already intense relationship with Latin America.
The report takes a comprehensive approach to the objectives that should be pursued within the wider scope of our relations and the Commission completely shares this focus.
Political, economic and cooperation aspects cannot be dissociated from each other if we want our relationships to develop in a balanced way.
In this context, one of the major advances in recent years has been the establishment of a strategic bi-regional association, agreed upon at the first summit for Heads of State and Government of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean.
The report underlines the importance of the priorities decided upon at the summit and uses them as a springboard to propose specific objectives in the political, economic, social and cultural fields.
In the political field, we support and share the desire to enlarge our bi-regional political agenda and to update the ministerial political dialogue.
Political dialogue is the central instrument for structuring and giving content to the strategic association.
This strategic association builds on common values which include diversity, tolerance, humanism and solidarity; it should allow both regions to assert their common positions and converging interests on international and multilateral issues of great transcendence.
Many of these issues are addressed in the report and some of them, such as the prevention of conflicts and the fight against terrorism, have just taken on a new meaning.
In the economic, financial and commercial field, I cannot but share your wish that the negotiations in progress with Chile and the Mercosur conclude with success as soon as possible.
The entry into force of the agreement concluded with Mexico is already having a very positive impact on our commercial relations and on our investment.
But I believe that we should be careful about using the same schemes that we are applying to Mercosur, Chile and Mexico for other regions of Latin America.
We should always take into account the particular characteristics of each region, its level of economic development, the structure of its commerce and the level of regional integration which it has reached.
For this reason, we have undertaken a thorough study of our present and future commercial relations with Central America and the Andean Community.
On the basis of that study we shall be able to decide how to continue developing our economic and commercial relations with those regions.
Turning now to the cooperation issues dealt with in the report, I should start by mentioning the positive impact that the implementation of the external aid management reform will have.
The new programming and management mechanisms will increase the coherence, complementarity and efficiency of cooperation programmes.
I should also like to make it clear that the emphasis on social aspects - in particular health, education and the fight against poverty - is a priority for the Commission too.
We are currently promoting a forum for an exchange of ideas between the different actors in civil society on issues relative to social equity, so that its conclusions may be submitted to the Madrid Summit.
Social equity should be central to the dialogue between Heads of State and concrete initiatives in that field ought to come out of this summit.
I am grateful for the support given to Commission initiatives in the fields of education and culture.
Before the end of the year, the Commission intends to adopt an ambitious scholarship programme so that postgraduate Latin American students can complete their studies in Europe.
I am equally grateful for the support of the rapporteur and this Parliament for the programme aimed at enhancing the participation of Latin America in the information society.
I hope I have made it clear that the Commission shares the majority of the objectives set out in the report and that we very much appreciate the quality and ambitious nature of the proposal it contains.
I nonetheless wonder whether it is necessary to adopt a common strategy to achieve those objectives.
We must bear in mind the dynamic nature of our relations.
That dynamism results to a large extent from the vast array of regional and sub-regional mechanisms available to us.
These allow us to develop a flexible political dialogue which is easily adaptable to current circumstances and priorities.
The vitality of our relations is largely the result of our decision to move forward on the basis of a strategic association built upon a relationship between equals.
The priorities of that strategic association are defined by the Heads of State and Government of both regions.
I therefore believe that before launching any new initiatives we should ensure that the process we have just started continues to develop and builds progressively on the present dialogue and association relationship.
I should like to thank Parliament for this valuable contribution.
With reports such as this, Parliament continues to present a clear vision of what our relations should be with a region which is developing closer political and economic links with the European Union.
Finally, I am fully aware that some questions were addressed to Mr Patten.
I am sure he would like to provide written answers to the questions from Mr Medina Ortega in particular, but also to those from other speakers, and I assure Parliament that it will receive a full reply within the next few weeks.
Mr President, my sense of nobility obliges me to respond to the positive and constructive speech by Mr Bolkestein.
As rapporteur, I would say to him that I almost did not miss Mr Patten' s absence.
I would also like to express my thanks to all of my fellow Members.
For reasons of accuracy, I would like to refer to a point that has been made in this debate that the great omission from this report was the failure to mention indigenous peoples.
I would like to quote directly from paragraph 27, which "calls for the new common strategy to make education, health and culture its priorities and to provide for targeted measures in support of those Latin American countries which require them, with particular attention paid to ethnic minorities and indigenous groups".
Therefore, to say that there has been an omission, when we are asking that the maximum priority within the new common strategy be given to indigenous peoples, seems to me to be a clear contradiction, although, naturally, I respect the opinion of all my fellow Members.
Thank you, Mr Salafranca.
I am afraid the Member who made this observation is not present and was therefore unable to hear what you said, but he will certainly be informed.
Shipbuilding
The next item is the report (A5-0373/2001) by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a temporary defensive mechanism for shipbuilding [COM(2001) 401 - C5-0393/2001 - 2001/0153(CNS)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning a temporary defensive mechanism for shipbuilding is extremely important, for shipbuilding is a strategically significant sector in the European Union.
I would like to take this opportunity to present the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which, regrettably, does not coincide with that of the rapporteur.
I wish to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, for her outstanding work, especially in view of the very short time available to her.
I would therefore like to thank her, even though she has difficulty in accepting the legality of this proposal.
Naturally, my Committee has examined this issue and concludes that the right legal basis has been selected and that the concerns regarding the proposal's legality are unfounded.
I therefore wish to comment briefly on the content of the proposal and the report.
It would be remiss of me, however, if I omitted to mention the constructive cooperation with the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
I think we have put forward a sound proposal.
I very much hope, too, that the Commission will adopt the amendments proposed by this House.
The conclusions of the Industry and Energy Council of 5 December 2000, in accordance with the 1998 Council decision, confirmed the ending of operating aid for shipbuilding from 1 January 2001.
However, it was pointed out at the time that if the negotiations with Korea failed, the Commission could adopt a different position after a review.
We must recognise that Korea has failed to honour the 2000 agreement in terms of price discipline and subsidies.
The Commission therefore had to examine whether, in the event of the failure of negotiations with Korea, which continues to violate current trade agreements by granting state subsidies, a temporary defensive mechanism should be proposed for European shipbuilding.
The proposal has now been submitted because the negotiations failed, and the proposed defensive mechanism must be evaluated.
From the Committee's point of view, the proposal is inadequate, as it is restricted solely to container ships and tankers for transporting petroleum products and chemicals (excluding stainless steel tankers).
The proposal allows operating aid of 6% and, in special cases, of up to 14%.
A dispute settlement procedure is also to be initiated before the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
These aid measures are to be applicable only until the conclusion of proceedings, that is, until 31 December 2002 at the latest.
We believe that the European Parliament should maintain its position that a dispute settlement procedure should be initiated.
However, this proposal on a temporary defensive mechanism is in need of improvement, since the three segments referred to only account for 20% of European shipbuilding.
Yet almost every segment in the European Union is affected by Korea's unfair competition practices.
In particular, those categories of ships which will also be the subject of the complaint to the WTO must be included.
Only then will our message to Korea be clear and convincing.
In this respect, Commissioner, I believe that your support for Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 is essential.
The duration envisaged is also inadequate, in our view.
We therefore propose that the defensive mechanism should be applicable at least for the duration of the current Regulation on aid to shipbuilding, Regulation 1540/98, which expires on 31 December 2003, or possibly until the conclusion of the WTO proceedings.
As the European Parliament, and as the European Union, we must not allow unfair trade practices to damage European business and put jobs at risk. Otherwise, these unfair practices will emerge in other sectors too, impeding growth and threatening jobs.
At the same time, however, we must strike a careful balance between justified defensive mechanisms and anti-market protectionism benefiting certain sectors through State aid, which impedes fair competition.
I believe that the Committee's proposal takes account of these concerns. I would ask you to support the draft report, and I appeal to the Commission to state its willingness to adopt the amendments.
Mr President, I speak on behalf of the draftsman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mr Valdivielso de Cué, not because he does not support the report, but because he cannot be here today.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy supported the proposals put forward by Ms Randzio-Plath by a very substantial majority: 39 votes in favour to 9 votes against.
The intention is to send out a clear signal against South Korea's dumping policies, which in recent decades have driven European shipbuilding to the brink of collapse by maintaining subsidies and benefits for companies in receivership.
For a year now, we have pursued a policy which aimed to reach agreement with South Korea.
A protocol to this effect was drawn up on 5 June 2000.
South Korea did not honour it.
In December 2000, we agreed to appeal to the WTO panel.
South Korea did not respond.
For this reason, the Commission quite rightly decided in July that temporary assistance of up to 14% may be paid by the national authorities, not from the European purse, for a specific number of ships until the end of 2002.
This is the issue today.
In line with Ms Randzio-Plath's proposals, we want to extend the categories of ships to include ferries for trains, persons and road vehicles, as well as natural gas and petroleum gas tankers, and we want to extend the term until 2003; in other words, we are in favour of a two-year period.
We ask you to endorse this draft report and clearly reject the Liberals' motion which calls for the entire draft report to be dismissed.
South Korea has the solution in its hand.
None of us wants long-term subsidies.
However, this is our only opportunity to exert pressure on behalf of the European shipbuilding industry on this difficult issue.
The debate is now suspended and will be resumed this afternoon at about 4.45 p.m., after the debate on the international situation in which the Commission will take part.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Vote
The next item is the vote.
Procedure without debate:
Recommendation for second reading on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 70/220/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on measures to be taken against air pollution by emissions from motor vehicles (11253/1/2001 - C5-0474/2001 - 2000/0211(COD)).
(The President declared the common position approved)
Report (A5-0364/2001) by Erik Meijer, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on action by Member States concerning public service requirements and the award of public service contracts in passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterway (COM(2000) 7 - C5-0326/2000 - 2000/0212(COD))
Mr President, I have an oral amendment to Amendment No 75.
After the vote on Amendment No 130: President.
Unfortunately Mr Fatuzzo, that means that Amendment No 75 falls.
Mr President, it is not 'unfortunately' , because what I wanted is contained in that amendment - it concerns pensioners.
(Laughter and applause)
We aim to please.
Before the vote on the draft legislative resolution:
Mr President, I should like to ask you to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution further to yesterday' s communication by Commissioner de Palacio that she would not accept what is now being decided upon by a large majority in Parliament.
In my opinion, we should set aside some time to consult further with Mrs de Palacio on this matter, because if we do not, although she may present a draft regulation in a few months' time, the regulation will be in a form different from that which has now been accepted by Parliament.
That is why I propose postponing the vote on the legislative resolution.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my side has admittedly lost in a key vote, but the process must continue.
We must now ensure that the Council forms an opinion.
If we prevaricate and postpone this issue, the Council can continue to hide behind its inaction.
I therefore propose that we reject the rapporteur's motion and now hold the final vote so that the ball is the Council's court.
We still have the second reading and the mediation process.
A delay at this point will not help: we want to move forward on this issue, and so I ask you to reject Mr Meijer's motion.
Mr President, I wish to endorse Mr Jarzembowski's remarks for another reason.
The plenary has substantively amended a Commission item by a large majority.
The Commission must also accept, for once, that this House may substantively amend a Commission item.
I am therefore in favour of continuing the process.
(Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
Before we move on I would like to congratulate Mr Poettering who I understand has just been re-elected leader of his group.
(Loud applause)
Report (A5-0354/2001) by Georg Jarzembowski, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on market access to port services (COM(2001) 35 - C5-0078/2001 - 2001/0047(COD))
Before the vote on Amendment No 47:
Mr President, now that we have adopted Amendments Nos 48 and 49, I would like to ask the Liberal Group whether Amendment No 47 automatically lapses.
That is my question, as we have agreed that the Commission must put forward appropriate proposals.
I assume that Amendment No 47 now lapses.
I think it lapses but if the Liberal Group wants to support me I am very happy to receive their support.
(Laughter and applause)
- (NL) Mr President, unfortunately, the rapporteur is right.
I thought that my amendment was far superior, but I accept that, as his amendment has already been adopted, it makes no sense to vote on mine.
However, I would point out that the Commission has stated that his amendment is not accurate whereas mine is.
Amendment No 47 falls.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0359/2001) by Luis Berenguer Fuster, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on insurance mediation (COM(2000) 511 - C5-0484/2000 - 2000/0213(COD))
Before the vote:
Mr President, I should like to make a point about the PPE-DE recommended voting list.
There was a mistake in Amendment No 8 as a result of a mistake in the original draft, which has now been corrected.
So Amendment No 8 should be supported by the PPE-DE Group as a recommendation.
Similarly, Amendments Nos 57, 13, 46 and 47 have a mistake in the English language translation which renders it nonsensical.
The word 'by' should be replaced by 'to' in the relevant paragraph (c).
The rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, supports me on both counts.
We will ensure that the language versions are corrected and correspond to one another.
Mr President, Amendment No 55, rather than being an oral amendment, in fact adds text that must have been forgotten, since this text does not appear.
Therefore, the following words should be added to the end of the text of Amendment No 55: 'will have to give the name of these insurance companies' .
Are there any objections to that oral amendment?
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)
Mr President, in my opinion, Amendment No 60 is not incompatible with Amendment No 41 and can be voted on as an addition.
I would like to hear the opinion of the proposing group.
Mr President, this proposed amendment works perfectly well as an addition, and can therefore be voted on as an addition.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
Colleagues, we shall only vote now on the two Caudron reports.
The remaining items will be held over to the vote tomorrow.
Mr President, we are in the middle of taking a vote.
I merely wanted to point out how absurd these foreshortened sessions are, without a Friday. It is never possible to deal satisfactorily with the agenda.
(Sustained applause)
Mr President, due to the large number of votes outstanding, I urgently request that we begin early enough with the votes tomorrow morning; otherwise, we will not be able to deal with everything.
Mr President, it was announced that Amendment No 35 would not be dealt with as it does not concern all the language versions.
However, it relates to the introduction of gender-neutral language throughout the proposal, and I would ask you to ensure that gender-neutral language is used in the entire research framework programme.
We will ensure that all the terms used are gender-neutral.
Before the vote on Amendments Nos 322 and 333:
Mr President, as I understand it, adopting the Committee' s amendment on the same issue invalidates the other two amendments.
It refers to the same paragraph.
I am sorry. I cannot agree because we are voting on additions.
Mr President, the principles included in the Caudron report are exactly identical to those in the amendments tabled by Messrs Liese, Nisticò, Fiori and Trakatellis, except that in those amendments, one more element has been added, namely the fact that we must also take account of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
That is the only point added, and I therefore hope that our socialist friends, as well as others, will vote in favour of this amendment.
Thank you for that clarification.
Do you agree, Mr Caudron?
Mr President, I agree with what Mr van Velzen has just said.
He is right about that minor addition.
We can therefore vote on it, and I vote in its favour.
Thank you.
The rest comes later, once we get to other parts of Amendments Nos 332 and 333.
All we are voting on is that section at the moment.
Mr President, I think the rapporteur wants to comment.
Mr Caudron, Mrs McNally is reading your mind.
I certainly wished to comment. When one is seated in the second row one can be seen more easily than when one is rather further away.
Concerning the three parts, the rapporteur' s opinion is to vote for the first and the second. He does however advise voting against the third part, contrary to a note sent to the presidency.
As is abundantly clear, the third part clearly states that work should concern stem cells from embryos or foetuses resulting from spontaneous miscarriages or abortions undertaken to safeguard the health of the mother.
That is outdated wording.
I am indeed sorry. It does appear that in this debate we are reworking the debate on abortion and this is causing me considerable concern.
Mr Caudron, you are possibly confusing two parts.
We are voting at the moment on part 3 - stem cells.
You have raised the issue of embryos at this point.
We are only voting on the stem cells aspect of this amendment at the moment - section 3 of the amendment.
No, Mr President, I am not mistaken.
It is indeed in Paragraph 3, in the last part of Paragraph 3. I am not referring to Paragraph 4.
To be absolutely clear, it is the words: 'to ensure the mother's health may be funded' .
Yes, Mr President, that is the part I did not wish to be voted on.
At least I am clear now.
Before the vote on amendment 330: Turmes (Verts/ALE).
Mr President, this amendment is about technology assessment.
In principle all the groups agree, but our amendment is a bit rigid on the financial implication.
It says: 'a minimum of 3%' .
So I propose an oral amendment which will read: 'activities in all thematic areas should be supported only if a certain percentage of the respective project is used for technological impact assessment' .
That is very clear.
Are there any objections to that oral amendment?
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment) Amendment No 33:
Mr President, could I perhaps invite the rapporteur to present his oral amendment to 335?
It was agreed with the rapporteur that the word 'and' would be replaced by 'or' .
That is an extremely minor oral amendment, and I know that the rapporteur is in agreement with this.
Do you mean 'fish or animal' , or is it 'new or improved' ?
Mr President, my reaction will indicate how much work I put into this report.
The draft oral amendment tabled relates to the second part of Amendment No 335, 'new or improved races' , and I feel it is indeed more appropriate to use 'or' rather than 'and' , because the human race could not really be subsumed under 'new and improved races' .
Alright, 'new or improved' .
Are there any objections to that oral amendment?
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment) Amendment No 320:
Mr President, as regards 320, I can go along with the proposed addition concerning quality as regards nutrition. I cannot however accept the deletions contained in this amendment.
If those who tabled the amendment agree, I can accept the addition to the text.
Do the Greens accept the oral amendment as an addition?
(The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance accepted the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0355/2001) by Gérard Caudron, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the multiannual framework programme 2002-2006 of the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) for research and training activities aimed at contributing towards the creation of the European Research Area (COM(2001) 94 - C5-0171/2001 - 2001/0054(CNS)).
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
Report Meijer (A5-0364/2001):
Mr President, we have approved the new regulation on action by Member States in the liberalisation of public transport services by rail, road and inland waterway, in order that this may be consolidated as a new single European market.
And, with regard to this, our Parliamentary Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled various amendments aimed at preserving aspects relating to the environment and sustainability in the transportation market, such as the rational use of energy and the fulfilment of standards on the control of emissions which contaminate the atmosphere, greenhouse gases, noise, etc, as well as giving priority to alternative forms of transport which make a better contribution to the much hoped-for reduction in traffic congestion.
We have argued for the need to defend the quality of transport services, whether these be run by public or private companies, and we have stated that social conditions with regard to the health and safety of employees in these companies should be closely linked to the quality of services offered.
We also think that liberalisation should not lead to an abandonment of the idea that passenger transportation is a social instrument and which supports the weakest groups in society, such as schoolchildren, trainees, pensioners and those living with some kind of disability, all of whom should continue to be protected through restrictions on ticket prices.
Ticket prices should be standardised in order to facilitate the integration and interoperability of different transportation methods, including cross-border transportation, where timetables and service networks also need to be coordinated.
Transport should be cheap and available throughout all regions, and should also guarantee a service to less populated and less prosperous areas at moderate prices.
Finally, it is not acceptable to liberalise urban, suburban and regional transportation whilst remaining, as some governments are, opposed to the liberalisation of state transportation, as for example the passenger railways.
Although it should be controlled, this market should be open to free competition throughout the EU.
Mr President, I express my personal satisfaction, as a Member and as the representative of the Pensioners' Party, for the approval of amendment 130 in this document, which regulates public service in transport by rail, road and inland waterway throughout Europe. Amendment 130 was tabled by the Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, whom I thank for tabling it, and voted on before the oral amendment, which, like the Greens' amendment, sought to extend the possibility of granting free travel on public transport to pensioners.
I therefore thank all the Members who voted for it, particularly the European Members of the Northern League - Mr Gobbo, Mr Borghezio, Mr Speroni - and of course above all the Members of the Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left who tabled the amendment that has been voted on, and also all those, notably including the socialists, who voted for it.
. (FR) We consider this draft regulation to be a real threat to the urban public passenger transport service in that it abolishes the freedom to manage our territorial communities.
Calling this fundamental principle into question in many Member States, possibly even going as far as constitutional recognition, is detrimental to free choice and, more importantly, to the free organisation of local public services, thus affecting service itself.
However, we can only agree with the exclusion of long-distance rail services due to the exclusive rights without compensation that apply to them.
We also approve all the amendments aiming to preserve the social clause.
However, for reasons of safety and coherent management, which would be jeopardised by the division of the lines, we consider the inclusion of local rail services within the scope of the regulation to be unacceptable.
That is why we propose that this text, which is neither acceptable nor desirable for the continuity of the local public passenger transport service, be rejected.
. (FR) For ages, governments all over Europe have been closing rail services to the benefit of private companies throughout the road transport sector, leading to the tragic accidents in the Mont Blanc and Saint-Gothard tunnels and the tremendous human and social cost of all, more 'normal' , accidents.
Today, the road networks are at saturation point, so some private investors are turning to rail in order to make new profits there, aided and abetted by both the European authorities and national governments.
Neither users nor the general population can expect to benefit from the privatisation of public services.
Nor will workers in the sector, who are denouncing and fighting privatisation and its devastating effects on employment and working conditions.
It is true that the rapporteur is concerned about the damage done by unbridled liberalisation and suggests the possibility of opposition by local communities. However, he is nonetheless among those who see privatisation as a fait accompli and the dismantling of public services as inevitable, and who are only trying to regulate the process somewhat.
As we are in favour of the development of public transport both on international routes and in regional and local networks, we do not want to support the dismantling of public services directly or indirectly, since this dismantling, even if it is regulated, is detrimental to users and to workers in the sector, and constitutes a severe social decline.
That is why we have not voted for this report, and we would say once more that public services everywhere must be designed and implemented to respond to the needs of the user, not to make money for private companies.
This report seeks to improve the Commission' s proposal, which, despite its name, effectively seeks to privatise passenger transport.
Although important proposals have been approved, and we voted for them, the fact is that the introduction of competition may jeopardise established rights for users, such as travel passes, and for staff, something that has not been sufficiently safeguarded in this report and will certainly be even less so in Commission and Council practice.
Thus, even greater obstacles to user mobility may be created, although certain proposals approved by Parliament along different lines are to be welcomed.
Furthermore, there is no proper guarantee of coordination between the various means of transport, and adequate answers are not given to those users located in less profitable areas: private companies may consider them unprofitable and then cancel services there.
Lastly, the vote against the legislative resolution is also justified on account of our fears regarding the implementation of the Commission' s position and the consequences for staff and users, which may jeopardise a quality, low-price service.
It should also be noted that, although the Commission is backing the privatisation of transport services, part of these services will continue to be supported by public money, which is unacceptable.
The proposal clearly states that its aim is to develop competition in the field of transport provision.
Contrary to what it states in several places, everything shows that within the framework of so-called 'regulated' competition, the results of opening up the market have not been positive, and nor has the efficiency of services improved.
Quite the opposite.
The overall process of liberalisation runs counter to improving the service for passengers, to improving working conditions, to respect for the environment, traffic safety and a regional planning policy that is not imposed by market restrictions.
We are stating our opposition to any liberalisation of transport, and our support for maintaining the status of transport as a public service, and for cooperation between public companies at European level.
We are against any State aid being allocated to private operators who are not, moreover, prepared to make the necessary investment in infrastructures.
What is more, we are in favour of the immediate re-nationalisation of all the private railway lines and networks in Europe and in favour of the re-nationalisation/municipalisation of urban and local transport.
The underlying problem is that it is impossible to compromise with market logic.
When it is applied, it is to the detriment of another logic, that of public service, which explains why we have voted against this report.
Report Jarzembowski (A5-0354/2001):
Mr President, open access to the port services market and equal opportunities in this field are not only appropriate but also a requirement of the Treaties on which the European Union is founded.
Regulation and control are needed in this particular field to ensure that no State provides financial assistance to its ports, since this is a serious threat to free competition between Community ports.
However, there are certain aspects which should not be exclusively regulated by the EU.
Member States and their constitutional bodies with competencies in this field should maintain their capacity to include their own specific standards for the invitation to tender for contracts for supply of port services and for the protection of workers affected.
Additionally, pilotage, mooring and the handling of cargo, including stowage and trans-shipment, since they are compulsory services, should not be included in the Community Directive liberalising port services, but their regulation should remain under the control of the Member States and their port authorities, for reasons of the safety of maritime traffic.
In an airport, there would be chaos if there were more than one company providing air traffic control.
In a port, there should only be one authority for pilotage and one for mooring, for the same reason.
As you know, Mr President, I was born in Genoa and lived in Genoa until I was 21.
I admired the port of Genoa every morning when I looked out over the city, since I lived in a very well-known district up high, from where I could enjoy precisely this beautiful view over the port of Genoa, which is nonetheless a very busy port, like so many in the European Union.
Well, in this document, which regulates the organisation of the port, port services and safety, I would like to have found greater commitment and greater financial involvement by the European Union so that all the ports in Europe without distinction, northern European ports and Mediterranean ports, could be financially supported just as our competitors in South Korea do with the shipyards in their country.
We, too, should help our ports and our shipping.
Opening up port services to competition, at least in the way proposed by the Commission, will have a number of serious, adverse repercussions:
a) on the quality of port services and the standards applied, because they will have to compete and will recruit unskilled staff;
b) on working conditions and the employment prospects of port workers, thereby jeopardising their health and safety, curtailing their vocational training and undermining their skills;
c) on the safety of transport by sea and the environment, due to the generally lower standard of services provided.
Although the Committee on Transport's motion represents an improvement, with the amendments adopted, it is still thinking along the same lines as the Commission and has even reduced the scope for public-sector controls, which is why I voted against it.
The generally-worded title of the Community directive before us conceals an important step towards the privatisation of ports, especially the services which they provide, such as pilotage, towing and docking ships, loading and unloading and storing goods and moving passengers.
The aim is not to improve the port services provided; it is to sell off yet another publicly owned sector to big business and hand a complete infrastructure over to the private monopolies so that they can make use of and profit from it.
The unavoidable consequences will be a reversal in labour relations and rights and a tragic drop in safety standards for workers, for passengers on board ships and in the services provided.
We want to stress from the outset that we are opposed and completely reject both the directive and the Jarzembowski report.
We refuse to be party to a line of thinking that accepts privatisation as inevitable and endeavours to rescue a few individual services.
On the contrary, we steadfastly support the argument for public port services and ports whose operations are integrated into an overall development plan which develops the potential of each country, supports the economy and employment and guarantees the safety of human life in port and at sea.
These are highly sensitive issues for Greece, with its large number of island complexes and its sovereignty in the Aegean, a sensitive area from the economic, social and national security standpoints.
We would also point out that multipurpose ports such as Piraeus, which support and serve the shipbuilding and repair industry, can only do their job efficiently if they remain in the public sector.
This endeavour is more than infuriating or provocative.
It is an attempt to intervene in the operational unit itself, that is, the port, and to prohibit it from doing what any enterprise does, that is, from operating as a single entity.
It breaks up and imposes internal competition between services provided by the same service provider.
At the same time, the directive talks about prerequisites for 'public services' but leaves them at the mercy of the private sector.
The Communist Party of Greece is fighting, alongside the workers, for uniform, 100% public-sector port services, so that they are able to operate, develop and connect with other sectors of the economy.
If we want properly operating ports, safety, coordination and development, we need to support a single, vertically-integrated service, with each activity helping and supporting the other.
Otherwise, the smooth and efficient operation of the sector will be at risk, any attempt at coordination will be doomed to failure and safety will be thrown to the winds because it will be subject to the laws of profit and competition and will have to rely upon the goodwill of the enterprises.
That is why we voted against the Jarzembowski report.
The draft report presented to us is unacceptable in its current form.
First, because it provides a confused response to the fundamental questions of competition between European ports and financial transparency in the allocation of grants to these ports.
But also, and in particular, because the indiscriminate liberalisation of all port services constitutes a dangerous threat to safety, the environment and employment.
To safety, because opening up to competition highly specialised services such as piloting, requiring specific skills adapted to each port, carries the potential risk of seriously jeopardising the safety conditions in which these professions are exercised.
To the environment, because liberalisation does not allow it to be taken into consideration sufficiently.
On these two points, the report and the directive contradict the 'maritime safety' and environmental risk reduction reinforcement policy launched by the European Union following the Erika disaster.
Lastly, such liberalisation poses a threat to employment, because opening up port services to competition, in particular those employing the most staff, such as freight handling, carries the risk of plunging the European ports into a dangerous downward spiral with regard to social benefits.
This tendency would be unsustainable in areas that are often vulnerable or in labour market areas that are already severely affected by industrial restructuring.
I cannot, therefore, approve all the provisions that would lead to port services being opened up to competition with no compensation or safeguards.
That is why I voted for all the amendments aiming to exclude port services such as piloting, mooring and freight handling from the scope of the liberalisation proposed by the directive.
As these amendments have not been adopted, I voted against the report.
. (FR) First of all, I would like to thank both our rapporteur for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr Georg Jarzembowski, and the Committee as a whole for the high quality of their work.
I have several reasons for voting against this report.
To me, voting against this report means first of all rejecting the liberalisation of intra-port services, that is to say going against the obligatory privatisation of handling and mooring services.
As piloting is the only intra-port service to have been recognised as an obligatory public service and as an activity requiring great care with regard to safety, it is the only intra-port service that will continue to be controlled by the Member States, and that will, therefore, be excluded from the scope of the directive.
I simply cannot comprehend, however, that mooring service providers, who provide an internationally recognised service of general interest by providing indispensable assistance both with regard to prevention in the field of environmental protection and in implementing the best possible level of safety, will from now on be subject to competition.
To me, voting against this report also means rejecting liberalisation between ports, that is to say, rejecting competition between ports, competition which can only have disastrous and harmful effects, with regard to both the quality of services rendered and the working conditions themselves.
Voting against this report therefore means arguing for increased cooperation between ports, recognising that ports are a full and complete factor in regional planning and that as such, they must not be subjected to competition that could lead to their eradication.
These, in short, are the two main reasons that have led me not to deliver a final vote in favour of this report.
. (FR) This proposal to liberalise port services is of immediate concern to us due to its potential practical consequences.
We feel it is completely inappropriate to seek to open up all port services to competition regardless of their type, given that some of them, due to their specific obligations, are of a public service nature.
Apart from national differences regarding the very concept of public service as applied to port services, optimum safety must be ensured in all Member States. They alone can define and control this by means of public service tasks, professional qualifications, restrictions or the definition of their activities.
The economic logic in favour of users must never take priority over safety in the widest meaning of the word: personal, environmental or material.
Therefore, we consider that this proposal must exclude all services that are of a public service nature according to the standards of each Member State, be they piloting, mooring or other services.
This is not the case, so we are voting against this text.
. (PT) Our vote reflects our position on a deeply controversial report, which has not been accepted by any sector of port services.
As we know, the Commission proposal seeks to open up major areas concerned with port safety to competition and does not guarantee workers' rights.
Although the report itself contains some positive references, it retains negative aspects that give some backing to the Commission' s position.
For countries like Portugal, this proposal could have highly detrimental effects on a sector that has already been affected by other, equally detrimental measures, and we have therefore voted against it.
. (FR) Having attacked public rail transport, Mr Jarzembowski, the rapporteur, is now attacking port services.
The logic behind this, which is still the same, is a direct result of the process of liberalising telecommunications, transport, energy and postal services.
This involves placing the organising bodies, infrastructures and professionals carrying out public service tasks, often in a public context, under the yoke of the market.
Three hundred European Union ports and all port services such as freight handling, piloting, towage, mooring, embarkation and disembarkation services would be affected by this directive.
However, a recent opinion poll confirmed by the success of the European dockers' strike of 6 November shows that these proposals meet with the mass rejection of port service workers.
The long amendment war that took place within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism may have meant for now that competition will no longer be within ports but between them, but these results are not satisfactory.
Moreover, because we demand that public service obligations regarding safety, regularity, continuity, quality, price and harmonisation with the system that is most favourable in terms of social protection for port workers and respect for the environment, be fulfilled, we have rejected the Jarzembowski report.
. The majority of British ports are well run and prosper because private operators have taken over from cash-strapped local authorities and are running the ports as successful businesses.
The proposed European Commission directive to increase competition in port services in the EU threatens to reverse this.
It would leave British ports vulnerable to takeovers similar to the takeover of various electricity firms by Electricité de France.
It would impose unnecessary bureaucracy on an already highly competitive and successful UK ports market.
It would threaten the independent, commercially based and subsidy free nature of British ports.
I would like to see private operators exempted from the scope of this directive.
. (FR) Mooring services are a general interest service as recognised by the judgment of the Court of Luxembourg of 18 June 1998.
Within this context, the port authority may require mooring services to handle any safety problems with no obligation for remuneration.
Mooring services provide all ships with the same quality of service, due to an extremely extensive knowledge of the port in which the service is provided.
The permanent nature of the service, the professional qualifications of the workers, their knowledge of the specific local features and the essential role played by mooring services in port and maritime safety make this activity an essential determining factor in environmental protection.
The deterioration of the merchant fleet as a whole and the increasing over-use of frequently faulty boats and equipment show the extent of the essential role to be played by mooring service providers in years to come, due to their technical skills and wide knowledge of their place of work.
Mooring services, like piloting, must therefore be excluded from the European directive, and that is why the group of the Greens has voted in favour of Amendments No 66 and 67 of this report.
), in writing.
(NL) Mr President, the introduction of the port package has clearly given European port policy a new lease of life.
The report on market access to port services has caused a great stir in the European Parliament, not least because the European Commission proposal predominantly deals with competition within ports.
The wish from the EP, dating back to 1997, to reach a Regulation on competition among ports has been completely overlooked.
In this connection, a request has been made for clear rules on financial transparency and State aid in the port sector.
The Dutch People' s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) within the ELDR Group wants to guarantee more transparency for government funding and has asked the European Commission to present a proposal to this effect prior to the entry into force of the present directive.
Otherwise, we would start to question the directive' s added value for European ports and their users.
Opinions in my group are divided as to which services should fall within the scope of the directive and which should not.
The VVD backs the rapporteur where he wants to limit the directive to the technical-nautical services.
However, in our view, pilotage services should be included in the directive.
Cargo handling services are by their very nature land-based and do not belong in this directive.
Furthermore, port authorities and users are required to make relatively sizeable investments in infrastructure and superstructure.
The tendering of the cargo handling aspect will mainly lead to red tape.
This administrative burden is not proportionate to the result and creates uncertainty within investing authorities.
It also creates an obstruction for urban planning authorities of the local councils, to which most ports in the Netherlands still belong.
The VVD is against including the cargo handling services in this directive.
. (FR) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work on this highly sensitive dossier.
Unusually, the division here has not been political but national, and the compromise brokered is generally positive.
This directive was necessary because port services must be opened up to competition and European ports require European legislation on port services.
If competition is encouraged, it is essential that it be organised by an appropriate framework. However, account must be taken of the specific nature of each activity.
I am thinking of piloting and mooring services in particular, since these, for safety reasons, must continue to be governed by the port authorities.
This method of management works very well in France and even if these activities are open to competition in other European countries, I am in favour of their current exclusion from the scope of the directive.
These are port services of general interest.
If these services are kept within the scope of the directive, the concept of port authority loses all meaning.
On the other hand, I approve of the liberalisation of freight handling, since this is a commercial service and opening it up to competition should be synonymous with increased employment.
Lastly, I have supported the provisions in favour of greater transparency in financial relations between ports and Member States.
In the name of legal certainty and fair competition between European ports, it must be possible to subject grants paid by national authorities to detailed inspections.
Report Berenguer Fuster (A5-0359/2001):
Mr President, I voted for the regulation of insurance mediation.
I take the opportunity to hope that the European Union will also soon regulate the mediation of public insurance.
'What is public insurance?' you will ask, Mr President.
Naturally it means social security and sickness benefit.
In this area too, citizens have the right to be properly informed about what the public sector offers them for their future lives as pensioners, and how much they must pay now, as workers, in order to have a pension tomorrow.
Moreover, the information service for workers and pensioners about their right to a pension should be regulated throughout Europe, to enhance it in every possible way.
Cross-border insurance mediation will increase consumers' options to choose between various insurance providers.
The directive proposal we have in front of us now allows insurance intermediaries to operate also in other Member States.
When making choices between various providers, EU citizens must nevertheless be confident that we, as European legislators, guarantee consumer protection by making sure that persons practising insurance mediation are highly qualified.
The report on the insurance mediation directive, which we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have been working on, is generally satisfactory.
We ensure that insurance intermediaries have the necessary professional competence, liability insurance or other equivalent insurance as well as adequate financial capacity.
Any insurance intermediary must also be a person of good repute, who has not been made bankrupt.
Simultaneously, however, we must ensure that EC regulations do not cause any unnecessary bureaucracy.
Our committee has made several amendments, which according to the opinion of expert advisors clearly make the directive more sensible and give Member States the option to make decisions in consideration of national circumstances.
We have achieved compromises, which the majority of Member States in the Council seem to be inclined to support.
It is important not to apply the directive to any persons whose principal professional activity is other than insurance mediation.
By this I mean in particular, travel agencies, who also offer their customers travel insurance as part of a travel package.
They make the customer' s life considerably easier and in Finland, for example, they are under the supervision of the authorities.
In connection with travel insurance accident insurance is also often sold, which include provision for compensations in the event of death.
It has been very beneficial to specify that these are not life insurances referred to in this directive.
It would also have been more beneficial not to apply the directive to intermediaries, who work under the responsibility of their insurance company, or for whose activities the company is responsible on the basis of international legislation and for whom the company also provides appropriate training.
As it unfortunately has been impossible to allow part-time agents, who act under the responsibility of their company, to be totally excluded from the directive, it nevertheless is good to relax the registration liability in the way our committee has proposed.
The relationship of Amendment Nos 14 to Amendment Nos 13 and 6 remains unclear, because Amendment No 14 allows for example travel and animal insurances to be totally excluded from the directive, while in other sections intermediaries providing those insurances are excluded from registration liability only.
If further amendments are still allowed, I would like to propose that Amendment Nos 18 and 22 be removed.
Insurance mediation by banks is no different from the rest of the mediation activity, and would not need regulation of its own.
Report Caudron (A5-0376/2001):
Mr President, what is this subsidiarity that is talked about so much in the European Union?
Subsidiarity, you tell me, Mr President, means that one should act at a European level when that gives the greatest advantage and the greatest benefit to all the citizens of Europe.
So how should we carry out scientific research in Europe?
With fifteen different projects from fifteen different States, which tomorrow will be fifteen plus the twelve that are joining, which makes twenty-seven, or would it not be better to have a single research fund?
Is it better to make a single decision on how to spend the money of all twenty-seven European Union Member States, the 15 current ones plus the 12 candidate countries, or to leave twenty-seven different chapters of the budget?
We should decide to have a single European research fund.
Mr President, I voted against the report, as some of the outcomes of the vote are incompatible with my own ethical and moral views.
Furthermore, I cannot understand why only marginal approaches exist for research in agriculture and forestry even though it is vital, for the future of agriculture and forestry, to set the necessary research priorities in this area in particular.
. (FR) This report is completely in line with the policy of the European institutions, where it emphasises aid to employers under the pretext of research and where it aims to strengthen the link between research and private interests, even if it sometimes cloaks this link in ecological or regionalist attire, according to fashion.
Nor is this report free of concessions to certain obscurantist ideas, whether religious or otherwise.
As for the budget for the Sixth Framework Programme, this penalises, in financial terms, research units whose work has been judged not to be a priority as it has little potential for profitable use by the private sector in the short or medium term.
The only reason we have voted in favour of this report is that we do not want to prejudice certain research strands supported by the report, which are seeking to make scientific, medical or technological progress, and nor do we want to risk depriving researchers in the public sector of the funding they need.
We have also adopted all the amendments that could represent progress in relation to the current situation.
. (PT) Despite the efforts of the rapporteur and most of the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, there is no guarantee that there will be no discrimination against countries and regions whose business structure does not have the economic ability to take part in programmes aiming at the rapid transfer of knowledge in technological innovation, even though there may be scientific resources.
Thus the efforts to ensure cohesion enshrined in the Treaty will not be enough to combat the loss of competitiveness that this will entail.
The assumption behind the aims of the Lisbon strategy was full employment and exclusion, and not the opposite.
Without being able to share in knowledge and take part in programmes, the less favoured regions will be left a long way from economic and social convergence.
. (FR) I voted in favour of this report.
I am a long-time supporter of research work at European level.
I am also pleased by Parliament' s stated desire to create and develop this interdisciplinary Community area.
In France, in particular, we are seeing a worrying drop in the number of researchers.
As a result of disappointing national policies, the most talented researchers often go abroad and only too rarely return.
The measure included in this report on the mobility of researchers and assistance with returning home will also, I hope, help to compensate for the shortcomings of some governments.
Stimulating research also means ensuring an independent training policy based on existing competences at European level.
Although the task of the legislator may be to provide a framework for research, there is a risk that this will be too restricted.
A Europe of discovery must also be fostered and work on biotechnologies, which represent the future, should be encouraged.
Similarly, the fundamental European research at the heart of the competitiveness of our industries and the substantial work undertaken by small and medium-sized enterprises and industries, whose input we know to be necessary to discovery and innovation, must also be supported.
Research also affects the everyday life of all Europeans and priority areas, such as food safety, the fight against the major serious diseases and improving public health, show the desire to associate research and wellbeing.
I am also pleased to note the support that is proposed for the development of research into childhood illnesses, a field in which national policies have often failed.
That is why I call on the Commission to publish proposals on paediatric medicines.
Research and development are of crucial importance if Europe is to become a continent characterised by economic growth and sound welfare.
International competition, especially from the United States, increases the need for new and intensified research efforts.
In its proposal in connection with the Sixth Framework Programme, the Commission has identified several important problems and research areas which Europe needs to concentrate on.
Obviously, it is important that Europe' s researchers cooperate and that research efforts are coordinated to some degree.
It is also very important that we should not only make it easier for researchers to travel but also facilitate the distribution of research results.
What worries us is that the framework programme involves a very considerable centralisation of research.
Major resources are being invested in a small number of selected areas.
Research is thus being directed in an unfortunate way because the Member States' own research routes will be governed by the Commission' s priorities.
For small countries with limited research budgets, the EU is thus in danger of becoming one of the main bodies that funds research, something which would give rise to an unfortunate degree of centralisation.
As liberals, we applaud the principle of independent research.
From the point of view of efficiency, independent research has shown itself to be far superior to politically directed research.
In the long run, societies which provide researchers with large room for manoeuvre when it comes to choosing subjects and methods achieve better results than societies in which the politicians determine the direction to be taken by research.
The principle of the independent pursuit of knowledge has, for centuries, strongly characterised research in Europe.
Universities and other institutions of higher learning have an important role to play in cooperating with industry and the public sector, but their most important task must not become that of taking orders from the latter.
We believe that the Sixth Framework Programme would give rise to undue centralisation of independent research.
We have therefore chosen to abstain from voting on the Caudron report.
- (FR) As a member of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and of the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics ( 'Bioethics' ), I have attached particular importance to this report, in its two main aspects:
the conditions for support granted to research in Europe, and
the ethical framework within which the European Parliament plans to conduct it.
As the amendments show, the essence of the debate concerned the part relating to 'ethics' applied to biotechnologies.
Insofar as the majority of votes approved the instrumentalisation of humans by authorising the use of human embryos, in this case conceived within the context of the treatment of infertility by in vitro fertilisation, to the detriment of the promotion of human dignity and integrity, I consider that the ethical framework adopted by a majority at first reading gives a negative tone to the report as a whole, including the technical provisions.
In conclusion, despite good technical provisions, the supposedly 'ethical' provisions mar the report as a whole by failing to respect human life.
Various Dutch fellow MEPs have made statements in the media to the effect that the Liberal Group refuses to prescribe ethical limits for scientific research.
Our voting behaviour has proved that this is nonsense.
First of all, adopted Amendment No 41 has a liberal pedigree.
It demands that both during the implementation of the programme and for the results, the ethical basic principles, such as protection of human dignity, data and privacy are adhered to.
Additionally, with regard to stem cell research, the guidelines drawn up by the ESF ethical committee must be observed.
Furthermore, our group wanted to adopt Amendment No 22 of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which prevents funding being channelled into research activity aiming at human cloning for reproductive purposes, the creation of embryos for research purposes and eugenic modifications in the genetic heritage.
Unfortunately, the restrictive text of Amendment No 322 has been adopted in which therapeutic cloning has been ruled out.
We regret this, precisely because therapeutic cloning offers genuine opportunities for patients suffering from Alzheimer' s, Parkinson' s, AIDS or diabetes.
We have therefore abstained from the final vote.
Report Caudron (A5-0355/2001):
Mr President, I was very young, I must have been ten or eleven, when someone gave me a beautifully illustrated Walt Disney book.
Its title was 'Our friend the atom' , and it was illustrated in that marvellous way that Walt Disney used to illustrate his universally famous works, as we might call them.
I was fascinated by that science book, which was so well explained to a young person like me.
Since then I have been in favour of nuclear energy and so I have voted for this document, especially because it promotes study and research into the nuclear sector in Europe, which, in my view, we should increase further.
Mr President, I view the expiry of the Euratom Treaty as an opportunity for Europe to phase out nuclear energy.
Yet today's vote on the Euratom programme has endorsed follow-up funding for nuclear research.
This is set out in Amendment No 12, for example, which provides funding for research into the safety of existing reactors (with priority for reactors in the candidate countries), as well as reactors of the new generation.
In other words, it safeguards future nuclear power plants.
Yet research should be targeting non-nuclear energies, especially renewable energies, in order to make a contribution to the progressive phasing-out of nuclear energy in Europe.
This is why we rejected not only Amendment No 12 but also the entire Euratom programme in today's vote.
. I warmly welcome this report by Gerard Caudron, which recommends changes in the allocation of spending to the Commission's proposal for the EUR 16 bn research budget.
It is high time that the programme's health research agenda was broadened to include more common diseases: most people have had contact, close or otherwise, with diseases such as cancer, degenerative diseases and cardiovascular diseases.
By allocating money to research these illnesses, the EU would be seen to be working for real causes that affect real people's lives.
The ethical, legal and social aspects of research issues are increasingly important, if not as important as actual research.
Therefore, by calling for the funding in these areas, the committee is showing an awareness of the importance of these modern-day issues.
The call to allocate money to the information society demonstrates a real commitment to substantiate the Union's stated ambitions laid out at the Lisbon so-called dot-com summit, to make the EU one of the most competitive and dynamic economies in the world.
There is no other option: if the EU wants to become a credible global player in the new economy and the information society, substantive amounts of money should be invested in this domain as soon as possible.
Finally, the allocation of money for research should always be informed by a consideration for the environment.
By funding research into renewable energies, this report shows itself to be balanced and environmentally sound.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.51 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Madam President, during this afternoon' s vote, there was unfortunately some confusion with regard to the Jarzembowski report.
The view adopted by my group was that if cargo handling was not included in the directive, we would vote against it.
We thought that that was the case, but that appeared not so.
Hence the confusion.
It was our group' s intention at the end, during the final vote, to vote in favour and not against, as we did, and I should like to have this minuted.
Mr Sterckx, we gladly note your group' s wishes.
International situation
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the international situation.
Mrs Durant, President-in-Office of the Council, now has the floor.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, since the attacks on 11 September the international situation has entered a serious crisis.
The purpose of my statement is to update you on the crisis and inform you of the initiatives that the Council has taken and will take further.
I will therefore concentrate on the question of Afghanistan, which lies at the heart of the current crisis, after which I will also discuss the situation in the Middle East.
With regard to Afghanistan, when the Council found itself faced with an emergency situation it reacted with determination and clarity.
At its meetings of 21 September and 19 October, the European Council defined the framework of the European Union's action, which comprises two main elements.
The first is solidarity with the United States and support for the actions taken as part of its legitimate defence and in compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1368, on the understanding that these actions must be targeted and endeavour to spare the civilian population.
The second is to contribute to the anti-terrorist coalition formed under the aegis of the United Nations.
In late September, the troika visited Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt, where it had in fact met the Arab League leaders.
Recently, it visited countries in Central Asia.
The EU-Russia Summit of 3 October and the European Conference of 20 October were an opportunity to discuss the action to be taken at international level.
The November meeting of the General Assembly will offer a further opportunity to reinforce this coalition.
In concrete terms, the European Union's strategy towards Afghanistan follows five broad lines: attaching priority to emergency humanitarian aid, the central role of the UN, the quest for a just and lasting internal political settlement, the importance of a reconstruction plan for the country and, lastly, the need to give the stabilisation plan a regional dimension.
It should be noted that the General Affairs Council of 17 October in Luxembourg and the informal summit of 19 October in Ghent clearly approved these five strategy lines.
With regard to emergency humanitarian aid, to date we have mobilised some EUR 320 million to deal with the crisis of the refugees and displaced people and with the effects of the famine.
The main difficulty is access to the people in need, which requires full cooperation from Afghanistan's neighbouring states.
The presidency has taken various steps to that end.
With regard to the release and distribution of the aid, there is close cooperation between the Member States' cooperation agencies, ECHO and the various international humanitarian organisations, such as the HCR, the World Food Programme, the ICRC and the many NGOs.
The second strategy line is the central role of the UN.
The European Union recognises the United Nations as the sole body with the international legitimacy to seek an internal political solution.
The United Nations will also have a determining role to play in the implementation of a reconstruction plan for the country.
The European Union therefore supports the UN Secretary-General and his representative for Afghanistan in their efforts.
It is also most interested in the plan that has just been submitted by Mr Brahimi, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative.
The Council is coordinating its efforts with a view to deciding how best it can contribute to the implementation of this plan.
On the question of an internal political settlement, the European Union believes it is important for the future Afghan authorities to be elected by the Afghans, for them to be representative of the ethnic groups on the ground and for them to respect and promote human rights, humanitarian rights and the rule of law in general; finally, they must refuse to cooperate in any way with terrorism and maintain harmonious relations with neighbouring states, thereby contributing to general stabilisation.
For the time being, the European Union prefers not to openly advocate any one solution over another, leaving this to the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General and to the Afghans themselves.
Regarding the reconstruction plan, in the light of internal political developments in Afghanistan, the European Union believes it is urgently necessary to draw up a reconstruction plan for the country.
It wishes to be involved, together with many other actors, including the donor countries and international organisations.
It also believes that this will be a long-term undertaking that will require a long-term commitment by those participating in the plan.
With regard to regional strategy, the European Union believes there can be no lasting peace in Afghanistan unless a regional approach is taken.
In other words, Afghanistan's neighbours, together with certain other powers in the region, must be convinced that peace in Afghanistan will also be to their advantage.
Legitimate account must also be taken of these states' security concerns, so as to avoid any further repetition of the foreign interference that has so often undermined Afghanistan and fuelled its internal conflicts.
The European Union regards the following countries and international organisations as having an essential role to play in any regional strategy with regard to the Afghan question: Pakistan, Iran, India, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, China, Russia and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference.
Obviously we cannot discuss the latest developments.
Events have speeded up over the last few days with the capture of Mazar-I-Sharif and Kabul.
These events show that the Taliban regime and the terrorist networks are gradually losing control of Afghanistan.
They represent another step towards achieving the international coalition's objectives, namely to root out the terrorist networks.
During these crucial hours for Afghanistan's future, Mr Verhofstadt, the President-in-Office of the European Council, reiterated the Council's position yesterday, namely that there will be no stability in Afghanistan until a government can be established that is stable, legitimate, democratic and representative of all ethnic groups.
This government will also have to adhere fully to the principles of human rights.
He also pointed out that the United Nations must play a key role in helping the Afghans to form a government.
The European Union intends to support the United Nations' plans to that end and strongly urges the Northern Alliance to contribute unreservedly to these efforts.
Moreover, the EU is prepared to help Afghanistan draw up and implement a vast reconstruction plan, a vital guarantee of a return to peace.
This project in no way affects the priority given to emergency humanitarian aid, which the Afghan people now need more urgently than ever.
Finally, the President-in-Office of the European Council stressed the regional dimension of the Afghan issue.
While the Afghans must, of course, themselves decide who will govern in the future, at the same time, all the other countries in the region will have to feel reassured by this new Afghan government.
It is with this in mind that the President of the European Council, accompanied by the President of the Commission, will be visiting India and Pakistan on 23 and 24 November.
With regard to the Middle East, the European Union continues to be deeply concerned by the situation there.
The violence and lack of trust between the different parties have prevented a resumption of the political dialogue that should begin with the implementation of the Tenet plan and the Mitchell report recommendations and should conclude with a just and lasting solution to the conflict, based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principles set out in Madrid and Oslo.
As part of its strategy of relay diplomacy, the European Union, whether in the form of representatives of the Member States or of the Council, is always present on the ground.
Thanks largely to the activities of Mr Solana, the High Representative, Mr Moratinos, the Special Envoy, and several European ministers, after many false starts, the Peres-Arafat meeting finally took place on 26 September.
Unfortunately, the Israelis and the Palestinians did not succeed in this renewed attempt to call a ceasefire.
The Euromed Conference held in Brussels on 5 and 6 November was an opportunity for a wide-ranging exchange of views on the question of the stability and security of the Mediterranean region.
It allowed the participants, amongst other things, to take a further step towards resuming a high-level dialogue that could, eventually, restore the trust that would be needed before negotiations on the final status could resume.
The President of the European Council and the President-in-Office of the Council will be heading for the Middle East again this week.
They will be accompanied by the President of the Commission and by Mr Solana, the High Representative, whose important role is acknowledged by all the parties involved.
This mission, which comes under the mandate the informal Council of Ghent entrusted to the Belgian Presidency, will offer an opportunity to remind the parties, once again, of the European Union's clear position on the goals the final negotiations must seek to achieve. These are, for the Palestinians, the constitution of a viable and democratic State and an end to the occupation of their territory; for the Israelis, the right to live in peace and security within internationally recognised borders.
The European Union will also point out that the quest for a global and lasting peace in the region means taking due account of the Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese aspects of the conflict, which must be resolved on the basis of the same principles.
To conclude, as you can see, up to this point the European Union has not stinted its efforts to seek a rapprochement between the various points of view in the Middle East and it will continue along this track for as long as is necessary.
Furthermore, the European Union continues to keep a very close watch over the development of the situation in Afghanistan and throughout the Central Asian region.
As a member of the anti-terrorist coalition, it will continue its action to combat all forms of support for international terrorism.
Madam President, Mrs Durant, ladies and gentlemen, as you know the situation in Afghanistan is changing very quickly.
Every hour brings its fresh share of dramatic news.
The military strategy against the Taliban has proved successful.
Yet it is important to emphasise that despite the encouraging developments of recent days, the task is far from completed.
The military campaign has not yet achieved all its objectives and we have always made it clear that we regard humanitarian and diplomatic issues as vitally important.
In the light of what has happened, we will have to redouble our efforts in this regard.
Moreover, even greater efforts will have to be made to establish a broad-based government for the Afghan people.
As Mrs Durant emphasised, we strongly support the process conducted by the United Nations, under the aegis of Ambassador Brahimi.
Furthermore, we must exploit the new military situation and intensify our humanitarian efforts.
The Commission is playing an active role on both these fronts.
Last week, Commissioner Patten met Mr Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank, and this week he has held talks with Ambassador Brahimi in New York.
The Commission will cooperate closely with the World Bank and the other parties involved with a view to evaluating the needs and contributing to the reconstruction work in Afghanistan.
The Commission does not propose to speculate at this moment on the exact amounts of money involved.
First of all the international community will have to assess urgent needs and, in consultation with the Afghan people, define exactly what is needed.
Meanwhile, we are trying to ensure that the EUR 52 million in aid allocated under the ECHO programme for 2001 and the EUR 22.5 million earmarked in 2001 for displaced persons will indeed reach those who need it.
In addition, thanks to the World Food Programme, we are now providing EUR 23.5 million in food aid, that is, about 36 300 tonnes, and we are granting the NGOs EUR 4.5 million for supplying the population with food, seeds and tools, that is, a total of EUR 100 million in aid this year.
Furthermore, we have already decided, at the very least, to maintain these levels in 2002.
As you know, the Commission has spared no effort since the events of 11 September.
As you also know, in the space of a few days we presented new measures to combat terrorism in Europe and, in particular, proposed a common definition of acts of terrorism, a European arrest warrant to replace the cumbersome extradition system now in force between the Member States, more stringent rules on money laundering and, lastly, legislative provisions to ensure that the assets of an individual or an organisation can be quickly frozen throughout Europe as soon as they are identified as a potential source of finance for terrorism.
Moreover, the Commission hastened to take measures to improve aviation security, ranging from access to the cockpit to luggage checks.
At the same time, the European ministers jointly decided that the Member States should try to protect the airlines from the worst consequences of 11 September, for instance, by giving them insurance cover against acts of terrorism, something the commercial insurance companies were no longer offering, while avoiding a war of subsidies, which would distort competition.
The European Union is also distributing massive humanitarian aid both within and outside Afghanistan.
The Union and its Member States have already mobilised EUR 310 million to alleviate the sufferings of the Afghan people.
This effort, which only the United States has surpassed, has largely gone unheeded, but it has already saved lives.
Furthermore, the ECHO humanitarian aid office has been remarkably diligent in acting on its undertakings.
Under the aegis of President Romano Prodi, the Commission is also involved in crucial diplomatic efforts; Mrs Durant has already described Mr Prodi's itinerary over the coming days and weeks.
This clearly shows that Europeans want to take a balanced, international diplomatic approach.
As you know, in the days immediately after the attacks, Mr Chris Patten, accompanied by Mr Louis Michel, the Belgian Foreign Minister representing the Belgian Presidency of the EU Council, and Mr Solana, travelled to Pakistan, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria.
Wherever they went, the message they heard was the same: mankind as a whole must unite in the fight against terrorism.
They discussed the need for closer cooperation within the region.
The Union has already taken an important trade decision by improving the access of Pakistani exports to Europe and we hope we will soon be able to conclude a free-trade agreement with the six Gulf Cooperation Council states.
Furthermore, we will be putting forward proposals on the conclusion of a trade and cooperation agreement with Iran.
We will also play our full part in the efforts to relaunch the peace process in the Middle East, not only by giving financial support to the Palestinian Authority, which is beset by enormous difficulties, but also by trying to ensure the implementation of the Mitchell report that the European Union co-signed.
As Mrs Durant pointed out, this week Mr Peres and Mr Arafat both attended the Euro-Mediterranean Conference held in Brussels.
As you can see, the European Union is pursuing a common foreign policy, but this is not a single policy.
Each country, each institution, draws on its own assets and pools its own resources for the sake of the common cause.
The action the individual Member States decide to take underpins the common effort, and vice versa.
The fact that the Member States take independent measures, especially in times of crisis, is not a sign of failure on the part of the Union. It illustrates the very nature of the Union.
In conclusion, let me tell you, on behalf of the Commission, that we are all aware that the events of 11 September have changed the parameters and we have recognised that the attacks on New York and Washington were attacks not only on the United States but also on every free and open society.
The threat is a common threat, which is why it needs a concerted response.
The European Union, and the European Commission in particular, are making their full contribution to this common objective and we intend to continue along these lines.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the day before yesterday, an aeroplane crashed over New York, and once again, we all held our breath because we were afraid that it was another terrorist attack.
Thankfully, it was not an act of terrorism, although it was a truly horrific incident.
However, Monday's fears show that terrorism is affecting our lives and that we cannot simply continue with 'business as usual' .
We must therefore make it clear that we regard terrorism as an enormous challenge, an intellectual, political, economic and, indeed, a military challenge.
I welcome your comments, Madam President-in-Office of the Council.
They tie in precisely with the keywords which I have written in my notes: we must dismantle the terrorist networks.
This is the task now being undertaken in Afghanistan.
We have all seen the pictures, which show the joy on people's faces in Kabul but also the dead bodies, obviously the victims of massacres. We therefore appeal to the Northern Alliance, which was led by Ahmed Shah Massoud, a responsible leader whom we welcomed here in April, to conduct itself in Afghanistan and in Kabul in a way which demonstrates that it is a good representative, also for human dignity and a better future for this suffering country.
What we now need, and I agree with the President-in-Office of the Council on this point, is action from the United Nations.
I welcome the fact that our American friends are involving the United Nations in this way.
However, what we also need, and the European Union must play a key role here, is an alliance, a coalition for the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
We must not repeat the mistake of the 1980s and 1990s, when we left Afghanistan to fend for itself. We must give Afghanistan our help.
The European Union's role throughout this conflict, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, has been rather pathetic.
Of course, the military issues are primarily national issues.
We are not yet at the point where we, Europeans, can genuinely take on a joint role.
However, I am extremely embarrassed by the conduct of some of the European Union countries over recent weeks.
First of all, there was a tripartite meeting during the informal summit in Ghent, and then there was the meeting in London.
I must say that I found this embarrassing.
We do not have any self-appointed chiefs within the European Union; we have a European Union with a Council Presidency and a Commission.
In London, the representatives, even the President-in-Office of the Council, invited themselves, and I found that especially embarrassing.
Great Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands and the Belgian Presidency attended the meeting in London; Greece, Portugal, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Luxembourg, Ireland and Denmark did not.
I would have expected the Belgian Presidency, which I hold in high esteem, especially the Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, to protest about this meeting, as it should have been the presidency's task to invite Member States to a meeting of this kind instead of having to request an invitation to go to London.
I hope that different procedures will be adopted in future and that this kind of division within the European Union will not happen again.
Of course, we have to learn from our mistakes.
I hope that we will learn from these mistakes as well.
From our group's point of view, it is essential that we act jointly, not only at the level of intergovernmental cooperation.
We want joint action from Europe, and we expect resolute and courageous action from the Council Presidency in this context too.
We will support the Council Presidency if it responds in this way, and we will also support the Commission.
Mr Busquin, I call upon the Commission, its President and all its members: please make Europe's voice heard!
The Commission must get involved; it must state its opinion, and it must not simply accept what we have witnessed in recent weeks and months.
We have a chance if we take this resolute stance, and I can say on behalf of our group that we will be resolute in our support for the Council Presidency and the Commission if the shared interests of the European Union are stated clearly.
We call on you to take this action.
If you do so, you can be sure of our support.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, little more than two months after the attacks of 11 September, we have all understood, including the United States, that, in order to confront global terrorism, we need to create a policy with many dimensions: military, security, intelligence, humanitarian, I would add cultural, and others.
And we need a common will: that of the coalition, whose framework or basis is the United Nations.
The news over recent days confirms that hope is beginning to come to Afghanistan, and we must state one thing very clearly: the primary victims and hostages of the aggressive fundamentalism of terrorism have been the Afghans, and particularly, the Afghan women, because it is they who have suffered most from this situation.
This is demonstrated by the television pictures we are seeing of women, and men, but particularly women, who can now move around with their faces exposed.
That is my first point.
We now have the obligation, through the United Nations, to seek a political solution to the Afghan situation, firstly, and to the whole complex problem of Central Asia.
The European Union must continue to cooperate in terms of humanitarian aid and cooperate with the UNHCR in order to deal with the problem of the refugees and displaced persons, and also so that, under the auspices of the United Nations, there is a plan for stability and future democracy in Afghanistan.
Secondly, we must continue to intensify our action, so that the European Union can respond to terrorism.
Police cooperation is improving.
Just yesterday, eleven people from Bin Laden' s network in Spain were arrested in my country, and this is happening every day in other countries of the Union.
In general, we are guaranteeing the rights of people who want to fight our democratic and pluralist system, and this is to our credit, but it causes problems.
And in Parliament we are trying to move ahead quickly, together with the Commission, to create a common anti-terrorist policy.
We must continue in that vein.
Thirdly, we note that we lack the capacity to act jointly in a military sense.
Up to a point, we have compensated for that lack by means of other policies, but that does not justify this vacuum in the security and defence policy.
Rather than looking back to see who was at the meeting in Ghent, or, bringing to mind that old film, 'Guess who' s coming to dinner' , working out who was in London and who was not, what the European Parliament has to say to the Council and the Commission is that we want the security and defence policy to be included in the Treaties.
I will take this opportunity to say to the Commissioner that my group, and, I believe, the whole of Parliament, hopes that the Commission, using its powers as guardian of the Treaties, and also its powers of initiative, will take a clear approach in relation to Laeken and the Convention by raising these issues.
We will support them in that and, in this way, we will be able to overcome the current situation: updating our security and defence policy, updating the Petersberg tasks and stating it jointly.
That must be our response.
I would like to make a final comment, Madam President, on an absolutely essential point which we were able to raise in the Euro-Mediterranean forum, which followed the forum held by the Council, where we were able to speak with our colleagues, parliamentarians from both sides of the Mediterranean.
We heard voices - Arab, Israeli and European - agreeing that we have to continue working, and the European Union is playing a central role for the first time, in order to create an Israeli State with secure borders together with a Palestinian State which also has secure borders.
This is the only possible basis for a stable solution in the Middle East.
We, in Parliament, must therefore decisively support the work of our representatives, both here and in the Middle East.
Madam President, the war in Afghanistan is clearly now producing military dividends, as has been seen in the past 48 hours in the extraordinary scale and speed of the collapse of the Taliban, although they still remain potentially very powerful in large parts of the country and the terrorists they have been succouring remain hidden from view.
However there are aspects of the war and not just the terrorist aspect which have been kept hidden and one group I should like to mention - to which, Madam President, you paid tribute on Monday - is the journalists who paid the ultimate price to tell us the story.
We know so little about modern war and we are so excluded by the powers-that-be that without the commitment and professionalism of journalists we would know nothing.
We need to reiterate that debt of gratitude.
What we know from the comparative success in Mazar-i-Sharif and now in Kabul, and even reports of the front line extending to Kandahar, is that new challenges are presenting themselves.
The international coalition - particularly the United States and not least its President - has assumed that the Northern Alliance is in some ways biddable, that it will do certain things and not others.
So we were told with some certainty that it would not take Kabul.
But it is there.
It seems to me that it is not quite so biddable as many in the coalition suggested or hoped.
It makes all the more urgent the diplomatic initiative to generate respect for the rule of law and a stable governmental process, even if not yet a stable government.
It becomes more urgent because new freedoms are emerging even as I speak, as we can see in the television pictures from Kabul.
But we also hear of new fears, because Afghanistan has a brutal history and the brutality was not just the work of the Taliban.
So there is a great need for urgency.
The second challenge is the humanitarian one, which preceded the war but has been compounded by it.
Now that there is a larger swathe of territory not subject to Taliban control, we must visibly and urgently assess what needs to be done and be present on the ground.
Our support for the humanitarian effort needs to be translated into practical action.
The Commissioner spoke of extraordinary amounts of money, which I think he said were largely unrecognised.
Unfortunately Europe's contribution is often unremarked in these situations, and we have to have a visible presence on the ground and show our solidarity, not just in the military campaign but also in the humanitarian effort.
I have two final comments.
One concerns the Middle East.
I salute the quiet but effective diplomacy of Mr Solana and his colleagues, the Belgian Presidency, the Commission and others, because, while America has been looking in another direction, we have managed to de-escalate the worst of the tensions, a necessary prelude to the Mitchell process which is the path to a viable peace.
Colleagues have referred to the European security and defence policy.
My group is strongly in favour of it and welcomed the moves in that direction.
We thought that was what ESDP was, until we discovered recently at Downing Street that it is European security and dining policy.
Madam President, I should like to hear your comments on the European security and dining policy, which runs counter to the concept of a European security and defence policy that is for all and not just for some.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I shall confine my contribution to Afghanistan.
It is extremely difficult to question the military course of affairs because the situation is so extremely fluid.
I should nevertheless like to ask one question in this connection, namely with regard to an element which, in my view, will remain high-priority for the foreseeable future.
It concerns the idea of sending a UN peace-keeping force to Kabul to ensure that the situation there does not get out of hand.
Has the Council discussed in any way or at any time the fact that European countries, or the Union perhaps as a whole, would make a contribution to the UN peace-keeping force, or does the Council hold the view that it would be best if this UN peace-keeping force were to comprise representatives from Muslim countries only?
In other words, is future involvement by the EU provided for in this UN peace-keeping force?
I should now like to turn to the humanitarian aspect. It is clear that there are still many needs and it is also evident that the invasion of large parts of Afghanistan by the Northern Alliance enhances the prospect of granting this aid.
Does the Commission know whether at the moment, or over the next few days, all aid which the Commission wishes to grant is being delivered promptly and adequately, or are there still obstacles?
If so, what are they?
Finally, I should like to touch upon the political and diplomatic dimension. My group fears that the politicians will be trampled underfoot by the military.
The fact of the matter is that the military conquests have preceded the political ones.
My group is concerned that finding a political solution could be frustrated or perhaps even made impossible if the Northern Alliance continues to advance southwards.
I know that the European Union and the EU Member States, alongside UN representative Mr Brahimi, are involved in finding what you refer to as a stable government.
What is the EU' s specific involvement at the moment, and in the next few days, in finding this political solution which, in my view, takes priority over anything else?
This might well be higher on the list of priorities than a military solution.
If no political solution is found, any military invasion could well be in vain.
I should like to finish off with a comment on London.
I am not so much concerned about the fact that countries that make military contributions, and that want to discuss this, meet in London. What does worry me is the fact that the agenda of London also featured the Middle East policy.
I would ask you, among others, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, whether Middle East policy is drafted in London or in Brussels.
Mrs Durant, Commissioner Busquin, let us not disguise our pleasure at once again hearing the sound of music on the streets of the Afghan capital and a woman's voice broadcasting on Radio Kabul.
It does us all good to read the sense of liberation on the faces of the Afghans and the rout of some of the most obscurantist and cruel oppressors the world has seen.
Let us however, without further ado, take a good look at all the aspects of the situation today, to make sure that our hopes are not soon overshadowed by a new nightmare.
Firstly, the fighting is, alas, not yet at an end.
The Taliban have regrouped in southern Afghanistan and near the border with Pakistan, where they will go to any lengths to try to save, at whatever price, the remnants of their power and capacity to inflict harm.
It would be a disaster if they managed to gain support for their deadly cause from Pashtun groupings, who might feel rejected by the new leaders of Afghanistan.
As for the various rival factions that make up the Northern Alliance, we must beware of idealising them.
The way women are treated in some of the provinces under its control gives real cause for concern.
Furthermore, its past conduct, only five years ago, and the disturbing information we have received from Mazar-i-Sharif unfortunately suggest that there is a risk that sooner or later they will embark on a bloody settling of scores in the reconquered territories.
Experience shows that what were once effective aids to military action can turn into serious obstacles to a political solution.
From the outset, the political issue has been the determining factor.
Secondly, we must look at the distress of the Afghan people, exhausted by five years of terror, months of drought and misery, followed by five weeks of intensive bombing.
The UN estimates that seven and a half million people are at risk of famine in this devastated country.
In fact, Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN Special Representative, has repeatedly called for a rapid end to the war for this very reason.
What the country does need, however, is emergency aid and development aid on a large scale.
For let us not forget that international opinion was mobilised specifically in order to neutralise the terrorist networks, to cut off the sources, mainly financial, that feed them and also to destroy the social and political breeding ground on which they thrive.
To date, we have certainly not achieved this just and ambitious aim and any failure to find a political solution to the Afghan problem would only take us further from attaining it.
This explains the role that an international player such as the European Union, and particularly the UN, must fulfil through its Member States, as well as within the framework of our relations with the American leaders and with the countries of the region.
This will enable a political solution to be found that comes from all sectors of Afghan society and from Afghanis who, until now have been the chief victims of the Taliban, must now be among the agents of change. It is high time this martyred population was offered stability, dignity and peace.
Madam President, there is a taboo word that I have not heard mentioned in this hour of debate and which I do not hear in the negotiation meetings held in Rome or Peshawar, in Islamabad or New York.
It is a taboo which I, or rather we, intend to confront: women' s participation, the substantial participation of women in the provisional government of Afghanistan.
The United Nations Secretary General hopes for an ethnically balanced transitional government.
The Council, in the person of Mrs Durant, has told us she hopes for a fair and lasting composition.
But what justice are we talking about? What balance are we talking about?
Millions of Afghan women have not only been the primary victims but have also been the major architects of non-violent opposition all these years throughout the world.
You know them: they are the women from Negar and RAWA; they have been here in the European Parliament; they were the ones who ran the country before the Taliban.
They made up 40 per cent of the medical staff, 50 per cent of the teachers, 70 per cent of the administration, while the men were off making war.
Yet around the negotiating table I only see men with beards, some longer, some shorter, but I have not seen any of those fantastic women we have met any more.
Well, I know very well that I will be greeted with smiles and grins everywhere.
I know very well how I felt when faced by those smiles in ' 97 and ' 98, when this Parliament and the Commission were, to my knowledge, the only institutions that supported the campaign 'A flower for the women of Kabul' in 1997.
This courage of ours - of yours, ladies and gentlemen - I believe should continue.
Now, enough of the gossip, the discrimination, the exclamations of 'women, poor things' !
No, enough of that!
We want Afghan women to take on conspicuous political responsibility in the reconstruction of their country in the transitional government.
I know this will not be enough; I know public opinion needs to be mobilised.
Therefore on 24 November we are promoting a day of fasting throughout the world, a world satyagraha, precisely so that women can at last form a part of this provisional government.
I hope this proposal of ours will not be received with the usual derision.
Often, those who concern themselves seriously with human rights have much greater vision, application and objectivity than those who always believe they know it all and think that the world today can go on simply with the traditional Realpolitik.
Things are not like that.
The human side, people are the architects of their futures.
What future can there be, however, without half of the population?
Therefore: 24 November, world satyagraha day, so that women can form part of this provisional government.
Madam President, last April, when we received Commander Ahmad Shah Massoud in this Chamber, he told us that the fall of the Taliban regime was inevitable given that the Pakistani government would find itself unable to provide it with any political and, in particular, military aid.
All that Massoud asked of the international community and the European Union was to exercise effective diplomatic pressure on Pakistan to stop it from interfering in any way in the domestic affairs of Afghanistan.
He was counting on his awareness of the Afghan people's exasperation with the Taliban when he predicted that it would rebel, including in the largely Pashtun southern territories.
He assured us that he had set up an Alliance network throughout the country that would guarantee the establishment of a broad-based government of national unity.
The speed of events over the past 48 hours has surprised only those of our learned experts who, without ever having been on the ground, professed that the anti-Taliban Alliance was made up only of a bunch of warlords who were just as barbaric as the Taliban themselves, and even more dangerous because inspired only by a hunger for power that would inevitably trigger new quarrels among themselves.
Echoing the anxiety shown in Islamabad, these same experts, totally certain they are right, are still spreading the word via the media that the Northern Alliance represents only a very small percentage of the opinion of the Afghan people, who are supposedly still attached to the peace that only the Taliban have managed to bring them.
The jubilant popular demonstrations in Kabul, the rebellion now underway in Kandahar itself, the signs of the return of thousands of refugees suffice to show that these prophets of doom were misled.
The Members of this Chamber who had the intelligence to listen to Massoud will certainly rejoice.
Yes, the situation remains politically fragile.
It is up to the international community, and within it the European Union, to help establish this united government, which the former king, Zahir Shah, is willing to support.
Yes, we must also give the Afghan people all the material aid it needs to recover from a disastrous humanitarian situation, in which, as Mr Wurtz said, we fear for the survival of 1.5 million Afghans who are at risk of famine and for the health of more than 6 million who are now at risk of serious malnutrition.
We hoped that the Council and the Commission would be prepared to give undertakings along these lines without delay. I thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for confirming this.
Madam President, Afghanistan is currently going through a time of uncertainty that will prove crucial for the future.
The end of the Taliban dictatorship opens the door to a process of democratic reconstruction, which, however, is still far from a foregone conclusion.
We will probably see Islamist guerrilla warfare on the Algerian model, against which massive bombing is pointless and will have to be halted.
The European Union must adopt a strong and clear stance for, as Mrs Emma Bonino and Mr Francis Wurtz said, Afghan women must not be sacrificed in the process of political reconstruction.
The participation of women is the key to the lasting reconstruction of Afghanistan.
They will have to be present as from the first negotiations and will have to participate in a new government as from the first day.
That is the only solution that can guarantee the protection and respect for the rights of women and all human rights.
The European Union could not endorse a proposed government that did not take account of this crucial dimension.
The integration of women is also a first step towards democracy.
Unfortunately, this democracy cannot accommodate warlords who have proved guilty of repeated human rights abuses, a wide range of acts of violence and who, whatever side they are on, are more concerned with defending their ethnic group than with the future of their country.
We must put an end to the reign of impunity. The Afghans must be represented by a mixed, democratic government that represents all the ethnic groups and respects human rights.
Madam President, recent events have demonstrated to the world that the military strategy being pursued by the American government in Afghanistan is working.
The removal of the Taliban from power in Afghanistan is a legitimate objective.
The Taliban is harbouring Osama bin Laden, an international terrorist who has committed heinous acts of terror, not only this year, but in recent years too.
Harbouring terrorists is a crime in itself.
The fall of key strategic cities in Afghanistan this week will certainly help in the process of eroding the power of the Taliban.
But much work remains to be done if the Taliban are to be defeated in the near future.
They are a military force to be reckoned with and they have extensive military experience.
I hope that the Taliban regime can be defeated and replaced by a broader alliance of political groupings in Afghanistan.
This is not going to be an easy task, but it must be vigorously pursued as a military option.
Under UN Resolution 1373 it is incumbent on us all to ensure that those involved in perpetrating such vile acts of terrorism in America last September are brought to justice.
We too must prevent further terrorist attacks, and this can only be achieved if the international community continues to work closely together.
One issue which clearly needs to be addressed in the context of the war in Afghanistan relates to the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people.
The international community, under the auspices of the United Nations and through the European Union, must bring forward a visible and viable strategy to guarantee that humanitarian supplies are delivered to the Afghan people.
A visible humanitarian strategy must be an absolute priority if the Afghan people are going to be able to live through a very cold winter.
There must be a safe and consistent delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need.
This can only be carried out with the involvement of the international community and key non-governmental organisations.
In time the United Nations and the European Union should be given positive roles as new political structures develop in Afghanistan.
We must all play our part in guaranteeing that international terrorism is defeated.
Clearly, a multi-faceted approach is needed if we are to guarantee that the roots of international terrorism are tackled head-on.
In conclusion, it is very important that we reiterate the message that the war against terrorism is not a battle against Islam.
There are millions of Muslims living within the Union who are fully integrated within our societies and who contribute positively to the development of the European Union.
The European Union as a political entity is a friend, and will always be a friend, to the Muslim people.
We must reaffirm this message at every opportunity.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it has been shown that the strategy pursued in Afghanistan by the coalition against terrorism is the right one.
It has also been shown that this is not merely a matter of hunting down terrorists, but also liberating a nation from a government which is far from popular among its own people.
This has been shown quite clearly, and I think we should say so in all frankness in order to make it clear in this way that we have nothing against an Islamic people; on the contrary, we want to work with it to build a future in freedom.
Of course, this also means, and this is borne out by Afghanistan's history, that we should work together with its own government and respect its decisions, and that it is not our task to involve ourselves in the details.
I think this is also extremely important if the task of creating a government of reconciliation in Afghanistan is to be mastered successfully.
Here, the European Union must take an active role with its conflict prevention and civilian crisis management capacities and help organise the reconstruction of the country on this basis, as long as this is what the parties involved want.
In more general terms, the events of recent weeks have shown that in the areas where the European Union functions effectively, it can make a significant contribution.
I do not believe that the coalition against terrorism would have operated as effectively in the Middle East without the European Union and the visits by its troika.
On the other hand, we must acknowledge that in the military field, where we are particularly weak, we have continued to rely heavily on bilateralism and directed solutions. I think it is clear that in all areas of security and defence policy, we must move more resolutely towards a community approach.
It must become clear that even the larger Member States, which think they still have a role to play, actually had no influence on all the strategies which have been enforced. We must therefore accept that we will only have a role to play if we act jointly, if we achieve our common goal of establishing a 60 000-strong rapid deployment force by 2003, and if we underpin our conflict prevention and crisis management capacities credibly with this third component.
I also think that this must, to a substantial extent, be discussed in the light of Laeken and in the context of the post-Nice process.
Time and again, when we are active in the foreign policy field, we see the extent to which our inadequate structures prevent us from bringing our full weight to bear.
I am thinking in particular of the frequent organisational chaos in the Balkans and the competition not only between Solana and Patten but also between the parallel structures which were established and which, as experience has shown, work against and not with each other.
These structures must be rationalised, perhaps in the hands of the Commission with their own legitimation via the Council.
In my view, these are the lessons we have learned from the last two months, and we should call on the governments in our countries to respond appropriately. I believe it is necessary, in the interests of the future viability of our nations, to cultivate this community method to a greater extent in future in the field of foreign and security policy too.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I hope you will forgive me if I go over my speaking time by half a minute.
Since Mr McMillan-Scott is not here, we could possibly steal half a minute of his time.
First of all, I should like to say that, unfortunately, the objective of the fight against international terrorism has not been achieved with the fall of Kabul nor will it be by a possible fall of Kandahar soon.
We must, of course, focus on many other criteria.
Of major importance are, naturally, the tracking down of terrorist cells in, inter alia, Europe, the freezing of financial sources of international terrorism and the whole discussion, also in our society, around the question as to what groups are, in fact, active in our society and how we can call a halt to their activities.
In my view, a large number of conditions must also be created in Afghanistan in order to be able to remove this kind of breeding ground for international terrorism.
A multi-ethnic government is logical, but we must also manage to find a special solution for Kabul, of course.
Peace must be established with the countries around Afghanistan to ensure that an area of stability and peace is created.
The refugees must be able to return home and a massive amount of money must be invested in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
Finally, we must ensure that a government is put in place that respects human rights.
That is a total package.
The causes can be found indirectly in the Middle East.
Although that is not the case, that argument is being used by Bin Laden.
I therefore believe that the Middle East peace process needs an extra boost and I also wonder whether the time has come to do this now.
I would direct this question to the President-in-Office of the Council, if she happens to be listening.
I would especially ask you whether you, together with the Commission, could not ensure that a UN resolution on a Palestinian state could now be laid down at long last?
Has the time not come for pushing for breakthroughs on this score, as we did years ago with Israel?
I also wonder whether an evaluation is not needed of the role of Saudi-Arabia in the funding of all possible institutions in western Europe which one would be right to question?
The position of Syria has already been mentioned.
As our President has already pointed out, I also believe it is useful and necessary to help the young Assad to play the far more positive role which we had all expected of him, but which, through all kinds of circumstances, he was unable to fulfil.
As, however, Syria plays a crucial role, a great deal more needs to be done there.
If we as the EU want to play a part, also in the peace process as a whole, we must be careful what action we undertake, for example, in connection with the arms sales or the supply of goods for dual use to Iran.
Israel is monitoring the proceedings with great concern, and I believe that these kinds of signals are of the utmost importance.
Finally, nearly everyone has already said it, and I am not about to repeat it, but it is unacceptable for the European Union to continue to send out a disintegrated picture.
We must show a united front and act at Community level in terms of external, peace and security policy.
If we still fail to get the message, how can we then expect to play a role on the world stage?
I therefore make a dramatic appeal, also to the presidency, to make huge strides forward on this score.
Madam President, I am very glad we are holding this debate today, at a moment when the situation in Afghan is changing by the hour and, I hope, for the better.
I know that Europe has two obligations towards Afghanistan.
Together with the UN, we must press for a political settlement of the conflict, aimed, as Guy Verhofstadt said, at the establishment of a stable, legitimate and democratic government that is very broadly representative of all the ethnic groups and abides by the principles of human rights.
Yet I believe we also have a second duty towards Afghanistan, an urgent duty.
We know that the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan is a tragedy.
It is the result of the combined effect of a war that has been devastating this country for 23 years and the drought that has plagued it for the past three years.
We know that seven million people were dependent on humanitarian aid even before the military operations began.
We also know that up to 100 000 children may die this winter unless adequate supplies reach them in the coming weeks.
That is why we call on Europe to take urgent, large-scale measures in face of this humanitarian tragedy.
In the framework of what we hope will become a process of permanent consultation between the European Union, the United States, Afghanistan's neighbouring states, the specialist UN agencies and the NGOs working in Afghanistan, we call, as you, Madam President, have also done on several occasions, for the creation of safe humanitarian corridors through which emergency food aid and shelter for the displaced Afghans can be brought in.
This is not only an urgent requirement; it is quite simply the duty of the peoples of the European Union, whom we represent here.
Madam President, I will reply or, at least, try to give some kind of reply to the comments made during this debate, which is all the more interesting because it is being held at a moment when we have very high hopes while at the same time having little idea of what the outcome will be.
Let me first take you back to the famous meeting in London that several of you mentioned and remind you that this meeting was certainly not arranged at the presidency's initiative.
The presidency is responsible for inviting and chairing the meetings of the Fifteen.
The Ghent meeting, by contrast, was convened for military reasons or, in other words, those who wished to meet in Ghent cited military reasons.
In regard to the London meeting, let me also point out that the presidency was invited to that meeting but as I said, the meeting was not held at its initiative.
Once he had been invited, Mr Verhofstadt, the President of the European Council, naturally contacted his various colleagues immediately to ascertain their individual positions.
He was strongly encouraged to go to London and at the COREPER meeting the following day, he immediately undertook to report back on everything that would be said in London and chose to be accompanied by Mr Solana, since he felt that these issues were indeed most important and related to security.
So these are a few facts about the context of this meeting in London. Allow me to repeat that the European Union obviously plays a diplomatic and political role but also a humanitarian one - and I am saying this not just by the way but as a definite statement.
I declared in my introductory statement, as Mr Busquin also declared on behalf of the Commission, that we attach great importance to humanitarian questions, not only at the level of words or financial resources, but also and above all at the level of deeds.
We are making sure that we take action here.
You may be certain that the presidency of the Council and the Commission are determined to make very concrete, specific and urgent progress in terms of responding to the situation and endeavouring to do so very visibly.
It is indeed important, over and above the action to be taken, for people to know and see that the European Union wants to play and will play a role in this respect.
I agree with Mr Poettering that Europe must speak with one voice.
I can assure you that the Presidency of the Council has done its utmost to ensure this, in particular at the London meeting. It was a meeting we did not convene but prior to which the presidency was asked to consult the other Member States and to attend together with Mr Solana.
That is what I have to say on London, Ghent and these matters.
In reply to Mr Lagendijk's question about, amongst other things, the United Nations force and the post-Taliban regime, the Council has not yet discussed the participation of the European Union as such in a United Nations force and has not, therefore, determined its position at this stage.
Therefore I cannot give it. Conversely, regarding the stabilisation of the post-Taliban regime, I think that will necessarily require consultation with the countries of the region under the aegis of the United Nations and therefore of the Security Council.
Since we are discussing this post-Taliban regime, which we all hope will be stable, multi-ethnic and democratic, while also knowing that the road will be a difficult one, let me put particular emphasis on a question which I and the Presidency of the Council feel very strongly about, namely the gender question.
We must indeed aim at a representation and a government that are more democratic, stable, etc. But we must also take the gender question into consideration.
Neither I nor the Presidency of the Council would find it comprehensible if Afghan women, who were the first victims of the Taliban regime and who suffered a great many deprivations, especially of their rights, while taking on huge responsibilities, were excluded from the formation of this government and its future activities.
Lastly, I think nearly all the speakers pointed out that we very much need to adopt a more integrated European stance on common security.
We need to act as a community.
The Belgian Presidency is convinced of this and I really hope this question will be on the agenda of the Laeken Summit.
Recent events have made it abundantly clear that we have to move forward together, in a more harmonious manner and as a community.
These are the replies I wanted to make to this debate, which, I believe, has highlighted some extremely useful and important principles for the days, weeks and months ahead.
Madam President, I just wanted to make three clarifications.
As Mrs Durant pointed out, the question of humanitarian aid is of course paramount.
As many speakers have also shown, it is a priority at a time when winter is approaching and the people are in danger.
I can only confirm our resolve to release the funds that have been allocated.
Let me repeat that the amount for 2001 is EUR 100 million, channelled via the World Food Organisation and the non-governmental organisations.
This being said, if we agree about the creation of safety corridors, I think it is then up to us to ensure, via the ECHO instrument, that the aid is delivered as effectively as possible.
That, at least, is the Commission's resolve. I can only confirm it.
Similarly, the Commission, in consultation with the international community and the Afghan people, including, of course, Afghan women, is assessing the reconstruction needs, as indeed it also did in Serbia, where that process was regarded as a model of speed and efficiency.
Finally, at diplomatic level, Mr Prodi and Mr Patten, in particular, are quite ready to respond to the requests the Presidency of the European Union will no doubt be making to them in the next few days.
Thank you, Mr Busquin.
The debate is closed.
Negotiations within the framework of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention following the recent anthrax attacks
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the negotiations within the framework of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention following the recent anthrax attacks.
Mrs Durant has the floor on behalf of the Council.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak about the negotiations on the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.
The attacks of 11 September have only strengthened our conviction that multilateral instruments for disarmament and non-proliferation are more crucial than ever.
Everything possible must be done to prevent terrorist organisations and their members having access to more powerful means with which to carry out their criminal activities.
The fight against biological weapons must, in this context, be pursued at a more sustained pace, particularly given the threat of potential bioterrorist attacks.
The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention is a crucial instrument in this process.
The European Union and its Member States have committed themselves to ensuring that this convention is universally observed.
The European Union will be launching, with regard to the Fifth Review Conference on the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention that will take place in Geneva from 19 November to 7 December 2001, a new call to those States that have not yet signed up to the Convention banning biological and toxin weapons, to ratify this as soon as possible.
Strengthening this Convention is, furthermore, one of the Union' s priorities in the field of disarmament.
The Council, therefore, attaches the greatest importance to concluding the negotiations that have taken place in Geneva, within the ad hoc group, on a legally binding protocol establishing an effective system that will ensure compliance with the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.
In its conclusions of 11 June 2001, the Council of the European Union once again confirmed its commitment to contribute to the drawing up of a protocol containing a raft of practical measures that it had defined in its common position of 17 May 1999, as essential to the implementation of an effective instrument.
In this regard, the Union regrets the fact that the special group has not managed to fulfil its mandate, which is to conclude these negotiations on a legally binding protocol before the opening of the Fifth Review Conference.
The Union has, in fact, expressed its disappointment at the United States' refusal to accept the synthesis text presented by the chairman of the special group.
The Council is, therefore, maintaining its position.
The threat biological weapons pose requires an appropriate multilateral response.
The Council will continue to emphasise the importance it attaches to the work that must lead to a legally binding instrument and, in particular, to maintaining the special group.
The Union has noted the statement by the United States, according to which that country supports all multilateral mechanisms currently in force for the control, non-proliferation and monitoring of arms exports and has also noted their alternative proposals, which the Union is still studying.
We have already discussed them with the United States and will continue to do so in the context of preparations for the Review Conference.
The Union reserves the right to also formulate its own proposals.
Lastly, the Union hopes that the gains made in the negotiations are preserved and that the Review Conference is able to take decisions that offer prospects for a rapid renewal of negotiations within the multilateral framework of the Convention, with the participation of all States involved.
Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I do not have a great deal to add to what Mrs Durant has just said.
I simply wish to confirm that the European Union has, for its part, always been strongly in favour of the compromise text, convinced that it is as important as the agreements on the non-proliferation of weapons, provided that these are accompanied by effective verification measures.
The Union is convinced that sending a negative signal on progress with international commitments on the non-proliferation of weapons would generally be damaging to world security.
As has been said, the compromise has not been accepted.
It is, therefore, unlikely that a resolution will be produced before 19 November, but regular contacts are being maintained between the United States and the European Union on this matter.
The United States take the view, furthermore, that the events of 11 September and those that have followed do not change their position on the verification protocol drawn up by the ad-hoc group.
On the other hand, for its part, the European Union maintains that this compromise text would have enabled a major breakthrough to be made at a particularly critical moment.
The Union also takes the view that the dynamic of discussions in the ad-hoc group must be preserved, even if the form and the procedure have to be adapted to circumstances.
The United States is in the process of drafting new proposals for protection measures against the risk of a biological attack, insisting on the need to defend itself against the risk of terrorism.
The European Union considers that some of the United States' proposals are to be welcomed.
Nevertheless, it also wishes to add others that are intended to improve the Convention and to encourage the development in the longer term of an instrument that is truly binding under law, but that is the very nub of the problem.
The Union will also be proposing a mechanism that will enable us to pursue regular dialogue on the Convention and will open this up to all parties concerned.
These measures will certainly be part of the discussions at the Fifth Review Conference.
In conclusion, and as has already been said, one thing is certain and that is that there will be no protocol verifying the biological weapons convention in the short term.
We are seeking to uphold the achievements of the ad-hoc working group.
Consultation is taking place on a regular basis with the United States and we are trying, on the basis of their proposals, to complement them with our own, so as to preserve the spirit of open and regular dialogue with all parties to the Convention. This, in our view, is the key to multilateralism.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is said that proverbs are the expression of the wisdom of nations and, according to a French proverb, every cloud has a silver lining.
The appalling disaster of the World Trade Center and the launch by a few madmen of a campaign of anthrax poisoning can at least be credited with waking up public opinion and, through public opinion, waking political leaders, making them more aware of the dangers of the development of an international form of terrorism that is bent on imposing its view of the world by all means possible.
In this regard, one only has to think of the recent sabre rattling by Osama Bin Laden.
I hope, by the way, that this will be his last, because he will surely soon have to account to international justice for his crimes.
I hope, however, that following his imminent fall, the international community will pursue its action to control and ban biological and chemical weapons in order to eliminate the terrible threat that they pose.
This is the reasoning behind Parliament' s drafting of the motion for a resolution that will be submitted tomorrow for the approval of our fellow Members.
We are pleased to see the change in the attitude of the American government which, in July, withdrew from negotiations on concluding a protocol to implement the Convention, as you have just reminded us, Commissioner, and we hope that the new conference that is due to take place next week in Geneva, which you informed us about, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, will consequently take place under the best possible auspices.
We wish to thank you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, as representative of the Council, for having assured us of the Council' s desire to coordinate the actions of the Member State governments in this area.
To this end, we call on the Commission to set up, under its own control, a specialist agency, that could rapidly intervene whenever breaches of the Convention are suspected.
Could you, Commissioner, give us your personal opinion on this matter?
Mr President, earlier this year we expressed our disappointment at the lack of support from the United States for the reinforcement of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.
In the wake of the events of 11 September and the anthrax attacks on the United States, the issue of bio-terror has suddenly become very topical.
Biological weapons are threatening to become part of the asymmetrical warfare which typifies the fight against terrorism.
The Convention is, of course, directed at states, but the effective implementation also makes it more difficult for terrorists to obtain these weapons.
These weapons have been banned for a very long time, but are unfortunately still available.
That is why we call for binding international rules in order to monitor compliance with the Convention better.
Fortunately, the Americans are back at the negotiating table.
They have a problem which they are unable to solve on their own.
However, the proposals they have tabled contain too many loopholes.
The tighter and more transparent the controls, the better, and that must also be the EU' s focus of attention at the forthcoming review conference later this month.
The Convention must become an instrument in the search of manufacturers of biological weapons, but also for tracking down existing supplies.
Russia used to implement extensive programmes.
How were they wound up, and what happened with the expertise gathered?
It is rumoured that scientists who worked on these programmes have offered their services elsewhere.
The anthrax attacks in the US compel us yet again to consider how we can stop the arms programmes in Iraq.
For this purpose, the UN must launch new initiatives.
Naturally, the Convention does not offer adequate protection against bio-terror, against the so-called non-governmental players.
This also requires more and better cooperation with the police and intelligence services, as well as better criminal investigation methods.
We need to offer our citizens better protection against possible attacks and the effects thereof.
Many countries take measures in order to protect themselves against anthrax or smallpox better.
The costs involved in those initiatives are enormous.
Poor countries do not have those funds and could for that reason become the principal victim of a possible smallpox epidemic as a result of bio-terror.
I would call on the EU and the EU Member States not only to consider the possible protection of its own citizens, but also to examine whether developing countries can be helped by setting up programmes to protect the people in the event of possible terrorist attacks involving biological weapons.
Mr President, my group, the Liberal Group, wants to make three points, largely in the form of questions.
First of all - and this point will appear in the compromise resolution which is not yet in print but it is certainly in our own resolution - my colleague, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, points out that the United Nations is extremely slow, or has been in the past, to respond when there are reports of breaches of use of these weapons.
For example, when Saddam Hussein, in the early 90s, used these weapons in the marshes of Iraq, it took the United Nations three and a half weeks to get inspectors there, giving Saddam Hussein plenty of time to cover up the evidence of his crimes.
Would the Council kindly point out to the United Nations that we need a much quicker response than three and a half weeks if such incidents happen in future, as we fear may happen.
Secondly - and this appears in the Liberal Group's resolution and also in the compromise resolution - the anthrax problem in the United States has drawn all our attention to the need to react quickly and to analyse what is happening.
There is no European Union-wide agency looking at this although, in the USA, there is the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta.
Would the Commission be willing to undertake to propose the creation of a European Union agency, under its control, which would coordinate the work of the relevant national agencies in our Member States in the field of communicable diseases?
That would speed up our reaction and help us on a Union basis.
My third question is addressed to the Council.
I hope it is a hypothetical question.
If the investigations in the USA show that the anthrax outbreak came from Iraq and therefore American public opinion becomes overwhelmingly in favour of an attack on Iraq and - I imagine that George Bush would find it very hard to resist such overwhelming public opinion - what would be the Council's position?
Would we encourage the EU to attack Iraq as well, or would we try to hold George Bush back?
Has the Council considered this?
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, may heaven preserve us from the weapons which serve and are designed to protect us.
After the attack of 11 September on Manhattan, the American people remained in the grip of fear following the anthrax attacks which, although they resulted only in a limited number of victims, have a massive psychological effect which reaches far beyond the United States.
The deadly product that was used points, in terms of its concentration and purity, in the direction of laboratories in the United States itself which are reported to be the only ones in the world that could make the product.
This clearly shows that the risks which our population faces as a result of the manufacture of chemical and biological weapons are insufficiently removed by current legislation.
A conference on this subject matter is to take place in Geneva shortly, and we would remind you that in July, notably, the United States withdrew from the negotiations about the Protocol that is before us.
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on 14 June to back the approval of this Protocol.
However, we are convinced that an outright ban should apply to both the manufacture and the use of chemical and biological weapons by the international community, and that this ban should be legally binding.
Current supplies should be destroyed expertly, and I fear that the Protocol too could still be too weak to cope with this.
Mr President, we have had a treaty against biological weapons and weapons containing toxins for a very long time now.
It cannot be applied and its application cannot be monitored without a protocol setting out how this is to be done, something we have been trying to achieve for years.
We have not succeeded.
The United States sabotaged the protocol, do not ask me why.
I read papers by American analysts who say that they have not had time to complete various biological warfare programmes which are up and running.
Be that as it may, following the awful events in New York and the anthrax attacks in the United States, we need to get back to the concept of monitoring and applying this treaty as quickly as possible, come what may.
I was astounded to hear the Commissioner say that the position of the United States has not changed and that we are unlikely to have a protocol with provisions on monitoring and applying the treaty in the foreseeable future.
We obviously need to withdraw what we say in the joint motion before you, honourable Members, about welcoming the change in the position of the United States.
We have made a mistake.
We must change it tomorrow in an oral amendment.
Secondly, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you have not told us how you intend to exert greater pressure on the United States, given that the whole business is down to them.
Will discussion alone suffice, I wonder?
Thirdly, new factors have come into play, Mr President.
It has been proven that genetic engineering can be used for this sort of weapon of mass destruction by applying research into vaccines and other forms of treatment which are easily hijacked for military purposes.
I have tabled an amendment for tomorrow's vote.
I think that we should adopt it and that the European Union should include this issue in the debate.
Finally, if it turns out, ladies and gentlemen, as the FBI is saying, that the anthrax was made and supplied in the United States, are there any Members here who propose that someone, do not ask me who, should bomb the United States?
Mr President, since this is the first time I have spoken in this House, please allow me to greet the presidency, the Council and my fellow Members.
The possible use of military technology and biological and chemical weapons by subversive groups is no longer a remote risk but a real civil defence problem.
The loss of military secrets, experts and materials has now been verified and is the real basis that the strategy of terrorism can use to strike against the civil population, which is defenceless in the face of such new aggression.
To address this new scenario of warfare, in which the enemy is well concealed in the meshes of civil society, protected by the very rights of freedom he is fighting against and where the targets are no longer just the armed forces but the civil population, it is vital to know what threats may be hanging over the safety of the citizens.
In view of the fact that some nations have not signed up to the Geneva Convention on chemical and biological weapons, as we have heard, and have continued to develop these technologies of warfare, we appeal to the United States and the republics of the former Soviet Union, as well as all those states that have not taken part or signed up, to provide the international community with detailed information on the biological and chemical agents they know about which could, in some way, be traced or stolen by terrorist groups.
The aim of all this is to acquire useful data as soon as possible to prevent the creation, stockpiling and spread of such means of mass destruction, and, at the same time, to prepare the necessary information measures for the staff of civil and paramilitary institutions to equip them to deal effectively and rapidly with these new scenarios of disasters caused by people without any scruples at all.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is an historic tragedy that the country which has refused to adopt truly effective controls on the use of biological and toxic weapons was the first to fall victim to these brutal attacks.
Of course, this does not prevent us from expressing our deep sympathy with the American people and especially the families affected.
However, I believe that this sign of isolationism and unilateralism, which is still very strong in America, must be viewed by the European Union, and in particular by the Council, as an opportunity to lobby the US very hard, not only on this issue but also on the International Criminal Court, for effective international agreements and monitoring arrangements in the wake of these dreadful attacks.
It is grotesque that in recent days, Congress has debated a bill which vehemently opposes the establishment of the International Criminal Court - a Court which would deal with crimes like these, especially if they were supported and perpetrated by states.
The second important point - and I would like to address the Commission in particular here - is how we, in Europe, are equipped, as far as is humanly possible, to defend ourselves against such attacks or to reduce their impact to a minimum.
As has already been mentioned, the USA has an agency in Atlanta, a disease control centre.
Does the Commission think this should be considered in Europe as well?
Of course, I know that when there is a problem, there is a tendency to call for a new EU agency to be set up, which raises further problems of control and supervision.
However, in light of recent developments, I think that there are various arguments in favour of this type of agency.
In general terms, I think that the Commission must do more regarding security against this type of terrorist attack, whether it involves biological or nuclear weapons.
This is not a task which we can simply leave to the Member States.
Certain safety standards in these areas must be set out at European level in response to this type of terrorism.
I also believe that the Commission, together with the Council, must consider how we should deal with the installations, factories and laboratories which handle these hazardous products, especially genetically modified products, without encroaching unnecessarily on the privacy of employees while achieving a minimum of transparency, protection and prevention.
Those who work in this kind of installation must therefore be prepared to accept a certain measure of control.
Finally, I should like to ask the Commission once again what it intends to do to create this protection, not only in general terms but also as regards practical measures, in the coming years.
Mr President, Commissioner, Madam Minister, nothing has been said in this debate which I cannot support.
Nonetheless, I would like to raise three points which, in my view, should be emphasised to a far greater extent.
Firstly, in the long term, we cannot expect other states to adopt security policies which are different from those we practise ourselves.
If we do not want proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in this area, for example, a clearer signal must be sent out by the European Union and its partners.
Secondly, there has obviously been a paradigm shift and a change in strategy in the USA on the verification issue compared with the 1980s.
In view of the urgency of these issues in the wake of 11 September, the European Union's diplomatic restraint, which I have often understood, is inappropriate, and I hope that the USA's unilateralism, which has just been mentioned, will be overcome on the basis of their own experience.
The third problem is the most crucial.
It is wrong to point to the USA alone.
This paradigm shift has obviously taken place here in Western Europe as well.
If I look at the model under discussion for the Biological Weapons Convention as well, namely the monitoring organisation for chemical weapons, there is currently a financial crisis in which EU Member States also play a role.
We have witnessed deterioration in the monitoring provisions since the Convention was first adopted.
Perhaps this is symptomatic, Madam Minister: in May this year, I asked the Council for its comments on these issues.
I have still not received a response, and I suspect that we, too, are approaching this issue with insufficient vigour.
Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I simply wish to answer the questions asked by Mr Morillon, Mr Swoboda and Mr Dunn on the issue of whether an Agency should or should not exist.
In the context of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, there was clearly never any question of discussing an Agency.
The Union' s position was to propose a mechanism for pursuing dialogue beyond the Review Conference in the form of either annual meetings of the signatories as is done for the Convention on Chemical Weapons, or of meetings of experts, in other words, continuing the former ad hoc group as was explained in the current state of discussions on this Convention.
Nevertheless, I should like to tell you that, at the Ghent Summit and, of course, at the request of the presidency of the European Union, the Commission has undertaken work on examining this issue in all its aspects and, therefore, on listing laboratories, in an attempt to see what type of response we can provide.
At the Commission meeting yesterday, a joint briefing sheet was issued by Mr Byrne, the Commissioner responsible for Health and Consumer protection, to Mr Liikanen and myself, to see how we can implement, at European Union level, in agreement, of course with the Member States, closer coordination in order to achieve our objectives, without necessarily creating an Agency.
This is, broadly speaking, the way things are heading.
In this regard, I would say that in the field of research itself, and, therefore, of the potential for knowledge in this area, we are planning a meeting dedicated to this issue, on 13 December, in Brussels, of all experts from the Member States.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I have received six motions for resolutions, tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Shipbuilding (continuation)
The next item is the follow-up to the debate on the report (A5-0373/2001) by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning a temporary defensive mechanism for shipbuilding [COM(2001)401 - C5-0393/2001 - 2001/0153(CNS)].
Mr President, after congratulating the rapporteur, I would like to begin by stressing that the ship-building industry throughout Europe is facing a serious crisis which could affect the very credibility of the European Union and perhaps endanger the continued existence of this sector in the Union, given the unfair competition on the part of South Korea.
Furthermore, it could represent an invitation or a stimulus to the Koreans to extend their unfair practices to other sectors of economic activity such as automobiles, electronics and steel. Of course, this invitation may not only extend to Korea itself but also to other countries, principally in that region.
Transparency suggests a challenge: free competition in a free market.
But a free market means the same laws for all, and given that this does not exist at the moment, our transparency in a world and at a time when we do not have the other elements necessary for the existence of that free market, as well as naivety, may result in a clear risk of disaster and also a lack of solidarity from the European Union towards the Member States and the cities of those States.
This is the case with a city such as mine, Vigo, in the North East of Spain, where companies and families have made an enormous effort and a difficult sacrifice in order to be competitive.
Solidarity therefore demands measures in defence of a sector which is also strategic for Europe; measures which impose the extension of the scope of the defensive support mechanism to all categories of ship built by the Korean shipyards and which also impose an extension of the period the defensive mechanism is in force until 31 December 2003, which is also the period in force of Regulation (EC) 1540/98 or, alternatively, until the WTO procedure against Korea is concluded.
Mr President, our future, the future of our States and the citizens of Europe are at stake.
Twenty years on will be too late.
I believe that solidarity demands, and leads us to hope, that the Commission and the Council will act in the way I have mentioned.
These are the reasons given by the companies and workers in the sector in the parts of Europe where shipbuilding is important.
Mr President, those of you who know me will be aware that I do not usually speak in favour of public aid which distorts competition.
That does not mean that I do not recognise that some of this public aid makes sense and must continue if it contributes to the objectives laid down in the Treaty.
Despite this, and precisely because this is one of those cases, I would like to express my total support for the Commission' s proposal and the amendments presented by the competent committees, which propose a defensive and temporary mechanism in the ship-building sector in order to confront the unfair practices of South Korea.
In this section, there is no room for solutions such as that proposed by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, which, by taking an extremely orthodox position in opposition to public aid, would have disastrous consequences for the European shipbuilding sector.
There is absolutely no doubt that the Republic of Korea is practising dumping in the sector, and for this reason the European industry cannot compete.
It is true that the Commission has begun proceedings before the World Trade Organisation to combat this unfair competition, but it is also the case that, while this procedure is under way, the European ship-building industry could disappear, with significant repercussions for employment.
We must bear in mind that there are two elements to this aid which make it worthy of support: firstly, it is transitional, it will only be granted until the WTO resolves the dispute in question, and secondly, it is defensive, it is a response to aggressive unfair competition by the Republic of Korea, and for these reasons it is perfectly acceptable.
Furthermore, the amendments approved by the competent committee are acceptable, since they include certain types of ship which are also affected by these unfair practices on the part of Korea.
The rapporteur has been informed of the existence of a possible legal report by the services of the Council which opposes these measures proposed by the Commission.
While we do not know what these legal arguments are, we must be content with the legal reports of both the European Parliament and the Commission, which speak of the suitability of the aid as proposed by the Commission, which is neither substantially distorted nor modified by the proposals which have been approved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would protest about the fact that the Council is not represented here today in order to provide us with the legal evaluation we requested.
It is unacceptable that we, as a Parliament, do not have access to the same information as the Council.
It is unacceptable discrimination between the two institutions.
I should like to have seen us in Parliament postponing the debate on the proposal until we had received the Council' s legal evaluation.
Unfortunately, that is not what the big two political groups wanted.
The usual demand for transparency is transparently not so important when money is at stake and national interests to be looked after.
I have, however, received an answer from the Commission regarding the regulation' s compliance with the WTO rules.
The Commission sees no problems.
There, I disagree.
The Commission says that the regulation will not have any negative effect on third countries.
That is incorrect.
In future, a Japanese shipyard, for example, will compete with European shipyards that receive State aid.
In that way, the regulation will have a negative effect on third countries, for example Japan.
The Commission also says that the proposed regulation cannot be regarded as biased action by the EU against South Korea, something that would be contrary to the WTO regulations.
The regulation states quite specifically that European shipyards can only receive State aid if they are in direct competition with Korean shipyards.
Korea is mentioned specifically, then.
A more biased course of action cannot be imagined.
With this proposal, we, in the EU, are doing something that is downright illegal.
I urge that what was adopted in Parliament' s committee be rejected, just as I should ideally like to see the Commission withdraw its proposal and instead concentrate on taking WTO proceedings against the Koreans.
What is the Commission trying to do with all these amendments to extend the period of the regulation and to increase the number of types of ship that are eligible for aid?
Will the Commission confirm that it will on no account comply with Parliament' s requests today?
Will the Commission confirm or deny that it has plans to table an altered proposal that includes LNG tankers?
I very much hope that the Commission will answer these questions.
Mr President, for years European shipyards have been condemning the dumping practised by South Korea in relation to the sales prices of the ships built there.
Finally, and after so many complaints about it, the Commission has presented an initiative, with the acquiescence of the Council, and has proposed certain provisional measures to us, which consist of a temporary defence mechanism, specifically designed to counteract Korea' s unfair practices, putting a complaint procedure before the World Trade Organisation.
Nevertheless, the Commission, in its proposed aid to ship building, only includes container ships and oil tankers.
We believe that it should also include special ships for the transportation of gases derived from oil and liquefied natural gas, as well as ferries, bulk carriers and roll-on roll-off car ferries, all of which are included in the complaints presented to the WTO.
It is time that Korea realised that the Union is determined to defend its shipbuilding industry in the face of unfair practices by any other country.
Mr President, this Commission proposal has arisen following the problems resulting from the liberalisation agreements it agreed to negotiate within the OECD while at the same time it limited State aid to the shipbuilding industry, promoted the concentration of shipyards and later removed operating aid.
Now that there are serious problems in the industry, which is of strategic importance to the European Union, particularly to ensure the security of supply on appropriate terms and to prevent excessive dependence on external sources, it has become necessary to support the European shipbuilding industry against unfair practices by Korea.
Although the Commission proposal is important for the moment, it is only temporary and partial, and in the end, is on the same level as Korean unfair practices.
In any event, it is important that the proposals that the rapporteur has made should at least be taken into account, including the extension of the expiry date of this 6% operating aid, in special cases up to a limit of 14%, and also the enlargement of its scope to other vessels.
We therefore back this report in order to prevent the short-term aggravation of the economic and social problems that already exist in this area.
Mr President, tomorrow never comes now that the European Commission has proposed to subsidise shipbuilding again.
It was made clear in the past that the subsidies for the shipbuilding industry would be discontinued in mid-2001.
The re-introduction of a temporary subsidy scheme goes against the agreements made and is unacceptable.
The granting of subsidies to the shipbuilding industry is both unnecessary and undesirable.
It is unnecessary because shipbuilding in Europe focuses on the construction of technologically advanced ships and not on the simple conveyer-belt production as is the case in low-wage countries.
It therefore offers not a single solution to the problems in the industry.
The granting of aid is undesirable because financially unhealthy companies remain in production thanks to subsidies, and efficient production is impossible as a result.
The industry does not benefit from non-generic support.
Structural solutions to the problems European shipbuilding is facing lie in healthy competition and structural reforms.
The Commission proposal, however, will undermine these prospects for a long time.
The internal market will be disrupted since the Member States will step in to implement the Regulation, and non-generic support will lead to unfair competition.
With this proposal, Europe places itself in an untenable position.
Lodging a complaint at the WTO is absurd if the Commission adheres to temporary support measures as suggested.
We therefore share the overwhelming concern expressed by the original rapporteur, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, with regard to this proposal.
In fact, I cannot imagine that the duty Commissioner Bolkestein would think any differently about this.
Mr President, colleagues, honourable Member of the Commission, the European Union and South Korea have been conducting so far fruitless negotiations in order to bring about sound competition into the world shipbuilding market.
The Commission has now approved a strategy, according to which the matter will be taken to the WTO dispute settlement procedure.
I support this decision and would like to thank all those Members of the Commission who actively contributed to this decision.
At the same time, however, the Commission issued a proposal to the effect that operating aid could be allowed to individual shipyards temporarily during the WTO procedure.
According to the Commission proposal for a regulation, any arrangements for subsidies would be exceptional and temporary measures and would concern a limited number of ship types only.
At first glance the Commission proposal may seem justified, but in reality it distorts competition both in the world market and even within the EU and lacks any valid legitimate reason.
The link between the subsidy mechanism and the WTO procedure is totally artificial.
These matters have no natural connection and therefore these questions should be dealt with separately.
All of us who are involved in politics understand this: this is politics, not a legal process.
If we want to lean on the WTO, we ourselves must act according to the rules set by the WTO.
By allocating subsidies, the EU itself is guilty of distorting actions of which it is now accusing Korea.
This will bring discredit on us and will weaken our negotiation position within the WTO.
I said that the Commission proposal distorts competition also inside the EU.
Even if only certain ship types would receive subsidies, the subsidised shipyards would always benefit from subsidy monies and would therefore have an advantage over other shipyards.
In particular this will impede the position of the high technology shipbuilding industry, which for very good reasons has responded to fiercening competition by concentrating especially on products representing more demanding technology.
Among others my home country Finland has from the very beginning, as agreed, reduced shipyard subsidies, and we have invested strongly in the building of cruise ships and other high technology vessels.
Consequently, through these actions Finnish shipyards have achieved world-wide competitiveness, which the Commission is now trying to take away from us.
Ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to express my satisfaction at the way in which Mrs Riis-Jørgensen' s report has been very fruitfully amended in committee, which will enable us to establish a defensive mechanism for our shipbuilding industry.
We are all already aware of the difficulties that this sector has faced for years as a result of unfair competition from Korea.
We are also aware that Korea continues to set prices below cost, that the Korean authorities provide their shipyards with subsidies, both direct and indirect, that bankrupt shipyards are kept operational, that South Korea' s production capacity increased by 170% between 1988 and 1997, whereas, during the same period, European production fell by 30%. And yet, during this time, European subsidies were ended.
All attempts to resolve the matter amicably have been in vain and a case therefore had to be lodged with the WTO.
I am pleased that this case has now been supplemented with a proposal for a defensive mechanism.
The WTO procedure will probably last three years.
It would be absurd to leave European shipbuilding unprotected for this time and the Commission has proposed a defence mechanism in the form of subsidies.
I support this measure but I would add that Korean competition also affects oil tankers.
One Korean company, with USD five billion' s worth of losses that have been absorbed by state banks, nevertheless won half of all industrial tonnage in 2000 - by dropping prices.
At a time when the consequences of the 11 September attacks have led to a pause in orders for cruise ships, a sector which does not need subsidies, orders for oil tankers are much needed, which is why we must include this sector in the defensive mechanism.
This is my contribution, ladies and gentlemen, to this very important debate on shipbuilding.
I too wish to see Parliament give massive support to the Commission' s proposal.
Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, for her tenacious and courageous fight for a free market economy.
The rapporteur knows something of which other colleagues in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Commission ought to be aware: State subsidies of any kind damage the economy, impair the operation of the market and harm consumers.
Subsidies make for inefficiency and increase costs.
What is depressing is that fellow MEPs now want to make a bad proposal still worse.
I come from Sweden. In the seventies, Sweden was the world' s second largest shipbuilding nation after Japan.
I had my first job in what was at that time one of Sweden' s largest shipyards. We built the largest oil tanker in history.
When competition increased from countries such as Portugal, Japan and South Korea, the Swedish state invested a total of EUR 2 billion in an attempt to rescue the shipbuilding industry.
No industrial investment in Sweden has been so ill-starred, cost so much and resulted in so little.
The necessary restructuring of industry came to a halt, and no new jobs were created.
If we in the EU now want to show real solidarity with the shipyard workers and their families, the Commission' s and the committees' proposals must naturally be rejected.
That would be an investment for the future.
Mr President, Commissioner, I will get straight to the point.
Our group supports the Commission proposal with amendments.
Of course, we question the way in which we put up defensive mechanisms when there is talk of opaque, unclear and unfair competition.
The rapporteur has suggested that we should not take any generic measures, as is now the case, namely according to types of ships and possibly a broader concept thereof, but has favoured measures according to regions and shipbuilding yards instead.
Separate support must be granted within the agreements we have concluded in this connection.
The question then actually arises as to the way in which people who, let us say, want to uphold the liberal principles, need to act the moment damage is being done. I will quote one example.
At present, the Commission has instituted proceedings against the Schelde-Damen construction, that is to say, Damen, has taken over the company Schelde for 1 Guilder.
Questions have been raised as to whether that is acceptable.
My question is whether, in the spirit of the directive which is now being proposed, it could be possible that the Commission, let us say in an oblique way, is now also turning a blind eye to constructions which are being used in this context and in the above example.
Mr President, the ban on State aid for what are mostly publicly-owned shipyards, the refusal to write off the debts run up by their previous private owners and the practice of handing them back to the private sector more or less free of charge are the mainstays of the policy exercised by the European Union which, in collusion with our national governments, has caused this strategically important sector to waste away.
This sorry state of affairs has been exacerbated by a dumping policy, especially in South Korea.
The blow which started with the seventh directive has been fatal for Greece's highly-developed shipbuilding industry.
Thousands of jobs have been lost, working and health and safety conditions in the sector have deteriorated and we recently mourned the death of another five workers, sacrificed to capitalist speculation in the shipbuilding sector.
Now we have a hypocritical proposal to give aid, the aid which was previously banned, to what are now privately-owned shipyards as their only means of salvation.
Yet again we see the European Union's devotion to the interests of big business.
The Communist Party of Greece takes the view that the only viable solution is to create a single publicly-owned agency which can withstand international competition and benefit employment and the economy.
Mr President, during this debate, certain things have become clear and have enjoyed general consensus.
There is a general consensus that the crisis is affecting the European Union' s shipbuilding industry. There is a general consensus that this crisis is due, amongst other things, to unfair competition on the part of the Republic of South Korea, which, according to Mr Caudron, consists of three elements: prices which are lower than costs, aid to shipyards and the maintenance of bankrupt shipyards.
I have also stressed that the crisis is serious.
Over the last 10 years, Korea has increased its capacity by 180%, while we have reduced ours by 30%.
What have we done so far?
So far, we have signed an agreement with South Korea which that country has not respected.
We have lodged a complaint which is yet to be dealt with.
And recently, a twin course of action has been decided upon: firstly, to take the case to the WTO and, secondly, to establish the defensive, selective and temporary mechanism which we are discussing.
It is as if Commissioner Bolkestein, faced with the non-compliances of Korea, had used the words of Cicero to Catiline: "Quousque tandem abutere Catilina patientia nostra [How long now, Catiline, will you abuse our patience]".
I would remind those Members, almost all from the North, who have spoken against this decision, of a military aphorism which says that 'the mission of the artillery is to bomb the infantry, preferably that of the enemy' .
In this case, the weapons of the North are aiming at European positions, bringing to mind in many cases the situation of Japan or that of other industries.
What does the European Parliament want to do?
Support Mr Bolkestein whole-heartedly and ask him to be more generous.
To be more generous in relation to the field of protection: that is to say, as Mr Ortuondo has stressed, that it also be extended to those vessels which suffer from unfair competition, those which transport gases, car ferries, etc. and that he be less stingy in terms of the date of application.
That he extend this temporary and defensive measure until 2003.
May God bless you if you do this, Mr Bolkestein.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Commission for proposing a regulation for the shipbuilding industry which may be temporary and segmented but which somehow, once again, helps minimise the effects of protectionism, which exists in various trading blocs around the world and not just in Korea.
In Korea it is not even a question of protectionism: it is a massive violation of WTO rules.
We should like to believe that the complaint that has been made will have some effect and bring some discipline to this sector.
The Commission has revealed, however, that it knows the proposed mechanism is not enough, and that it is only one step, and a step with all the negative baggage that stopgap measures entail, once we get beyond the deficit and crises of the shipbuilding industry, some of which have already been mentioned here, so I shall not repeat them.
But while it is true that the Nordic countries support investment and alternative technology, and thus achieve added value and still manage to keep active in the market without great social upheaval, this is not equally true for other European Union regions, such as southern Europe, regions where this sector is the largest employer and supports employment in a number of services and subsidiary industries.
It is often the only activity that generates development in these regions, and so the disappearance of this activity would be a social tragedy for certain regions, particularly in my country, in Spain and in Greece.
But while we hope that the Commission will implement this regulation at least by 2003, we hope for a lot more for the future and a different attitude towards the sector.
Mr President, on 5 December 2000, the Council decided that the granting of State aid of up to 9 per cent to the shipbuilding industry should cease for all Member States at the end of the year 2000.
This was for two reasons: State aid had not proved to have had any major effect on the industry' s ability to survive, and there was a conviction on grounds of principle that State aid should be reduced as much as possible and preferably cease.
Parliament shared this view as recently as last year.
State aid to shipyards is, moreover, contrary to international trade agreements, a fact crystallised by the Commission' s attempt in the autumn of 1999 and the spring of 2000 to reach a negotiated solution with South Korea to the problem of their having violated current trade agreements by providing extensive State aid.
Now that that attempt has failed, the Commission is instead tabling a proposal for a so-called temporary defensive mechanism for the shipbuilding industry, involving aid of between 6 and 14 per cent.
According to the committee' s proposal, this is to continue right up until the end of 2003, at the same time as dispute settlement proceedings have been instituted before the WTO against South Korea as a result of the latter' s having violated current trade agreements.
The reintroduction of extensive State aid within the EU would scarcely increase the prospects of solving the dispute with South Korea.
It would make more sense to reject the Commission' s proposal and put every effort into the WTO proceedings against South Korea.
In conclusion, I should like to put the following question to Commissioner Bolkestein: how does he think this proposal stands in relation to the EU' s competition policy through which we are trying to minimise, and preferably remove, State aid to industries in order to create fair and healthy competition between companies?
Mr President, my colleague, Mr Monti, has asked me to pass on his regrets to Parliament for his absence and to respond on his behalf.
I should like, on Mr Monti's behalf, to thank Mrs Riis-Jørgensen for her hard work and considerable input into this report.
We are extremely grateful for the rapid handling of this file by Parliament.
I also wish to take this opportunity to explain to Parliament the Commission's position on this report.
Ideally, there would be no need for the Commission to present this proposal.
I stress that operating aid is a particularly distorting form of aid, because it provides no incentive to improve efficiency and delivers no benefit in terms of competitiveness of the yards by, for example, encouraging training or research development.
Nor, indeed, does it help the environment.
For those reasons and after many years of operating aid being granted to the shipbuilding industry, the Commission finally decided to prohibit it as from the end of last year.
However, to quote a well-known philosopher, we do not live in the best of all possible worlds.
That being so, it is only right that the Community should take action against any unfair competitive practices, and it is within that context that the proposal for the temporary defensive mechanism should be seen.
This proposal is one part of a two-pronged strategy against Korean practices and is designed to support the Community's action against Korea in the WTO.
It is an exceptional measure, and is only taken in the light of a situation which led one representative rightly to quote Cicero saying: 'Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra?'
It is, as I say, an exceptional measure, whose purpose is to put pressure on Korea to bring it to the negotiating table with the Community and to force it to bring an end to its unfair commercial practices.
As far as the Commission is concerned, it is not in any way the beginning of a new, possibly open ended regime of operating aid.
That emphatically is not the Commission's intention.
I note that the proposed amendments to the Commission's proposal relate to three main issues.
Firstly, there is the scope of the mechanism. Secondly, there is the information to be made available to the Member States and also to third parties through Member States.
Thirdly and finally, there is the matter of its duration. I should like to respond to these points in that order.
So, firstly, on the extension of the scope: the amendments proposed in the report would considerably widen the scope of the mechanism, which covers only those market segments that the Commission has identified, in its report on the trade barriers regulation, as having already been considerably injured by unfair Korean practices.
The proposal strikes a balance between a high maximum aid ceiling of 14% on the one hand and limited eligibility on the other hand.
It is therefore specifically designed to counter unfair Korean practices.
Any enlargement of the scope would risk changing the nature of the proposal.
I would like to draw Members' attention to Article 2(6) of the proposal, which provides that the Commission will keep under review the market segments eligible for aid in the light of evidence clearly proving that a specific market segment within the Community has been directly injured by unfair and opaque competitive conditions.
The Commission will, accordingly, monitor the situation and keep Parliament informed of any potential review under that provision.
The second point relates to information provided to Member States and third parties through Member States, that is, the removal of the name and address of the applicant shipyard and prospective purchaser.
That is the intention of the amendments put forward.
The information that has been specified in Article (2)(a) of the Commission's proposal is the minimum necessary to allow third parties to submit useful comments to the Commission and to ensure the effectiveness of the transparency procedure.
The purpose of that provision is to speed up the procedure.
The alternative option would be to open the formal investigation procedure in all cases where the Commission has doubts about the compatibility of aid.
That would entail the full publication of detailed information relating to the notification.
Thirdly, there is the extension of the expiry date until 31 December 2003.
It has been argued by some Members of Parliament that the expiry date of the mechanism is too early.
But by the end of 2002 we will have a good idea of how the WTO action is proceeding.
It would be a timely opportunity to take stock of the situation and to reassess whether special measures for shipbuilding are still considered necessary.
The Commission can, at that stage, propose an extension of the defensive mechanisms to the Council.
In addition to what I have just said on behalf of my colleague Mr Monti, I should like to reply more specifically to two or three questions that were put to the Commission just now.
Firstly, Mr Blokland claims that there is a need for structural changes and not for more aid to ailing industries.
I would agree with him that ideally subsidies should support structural change.
Let us hope that in this case that is true.
Various Members have raised the issue of compatibility with the WTO.
In the Commission's view the proposal on a temporary defensive mechanism is fully compatible with WTO law subsidies, provided they are not prohibitive, are not drawn to cause so-called adverse effects and are legitimate national policy instruments as far as the WTO is concerned.
Therefore the European Community has the right to grant aid to its shipbuilders.
In fact the EC has been granting such aid to its shipbuilding industry for many years, up to 31 December 2000.
Insofar as subsidies are not sanctions in the sense of the dispute settlement procedure, they are permitted policy measures.
Therefore the recourse to dispute settlement can in no way be seen as limiting the normal rights and obligations of Members under the WTO agreements.
Lastly, in reply to Mrs Riis-Jørgensen's question, as to whether the Commission would submit a new proposal for the reasons explained, the Commission does not see any reason to modify the proposal.
Therefore the Commission has no plans to put forward a new proposal.
The Commission is grateful for the support Parliament has so far shown for this proposal.
For the reasons that I have outlined, the proposed amendments are not acceptable to the Commission.
Nevertheless I very much hope that we can count on Parliament's continued support in this matter.
Mr President, I am glad Mr Bolkestein confirmed that he will not submit a new proposal.
But he also referred to the review clause in the proposal.
Can you assure me today, Mr Bolkestein, that you are not going to give in to France by permitting it to subsidise its shipyards in order to get agreement in the Council in December?
Can you confirm that you will make no agreement with France before that meeting?
In reply to Mrs Riis-Jørgensen's question, I repeat that the Commission stands by the position I have outlined just now.
Any further negotiations are, as far as the Commission is concerned, not in order.
We will see what happens in the Industry Council at the beginning of December.
As far as the position of one Member State is concerned, the Commission has nothing further to add.
) Mr President, my speech concerns a matter of procedure.
My view is that from the point of view of the working of the Members of Parliament it is very unsatisfactory that reports are continuously moved to entirely different time slots on the agenda.
Mrs Peijs' s report was originally due to be considered at the afternoon session, then we were informed that it has been moved to the session starting at 9 p.m., after that a notification suddenly appeared here at 5.15 p.m. that in actual fact its processing is starting now.
This kind of tossing the ball back and forth is not acceptable with regard to getting the Members' time schedules organised.
Another matter I would like to draw attention to is the absence of the Council.
The Council question time is starting now.
Surely they would have been able to arrive half an hour earlier to discuss, for example, this matter which is very important to the shipbuilding industry.
The Council, however, is again conspicuous by being absent.
I deeply regret that this is happening.
I do understand your concern, Mrs Kauppi, but I must tell you that Council Question Time is also set on our agenda for a very precise time, which is 5.30 p.m.
Members who have tabled questions will, therefore, be joining us in a few minutes. We must give them the floor.
Having said that, although our debates are programmed into the agenda, it is impossible to predict exactly how long they will last, give or take a few minutes or a quarter of an hour, not least because the Commissioners and the ministers sometimes take up much more speaking time than the sitting staff plan for.
This is why I would ask you to show some understanding and flexibility.
We have two or three minutes left before 5.30 p.m. and I therefore suspend the sitting until Council Question Time.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.27 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)
Question Time (Council)
The next item is Questions to the Council (B5-0338/2001).
On behalf of the Council, Mrs Durant is with us as President-in-Office of the Council and we thank her for being here.
She is Vice Prime Minister and Minister for Mobility and Transport.
As the author, Mr Staes, is not present, Question No 1 lapses.
The fact that we have started on time today has probably surprised some Members who always bank on a delay, but not today.
The second question has been withdrawn.
Question No 3 by (H-0778/01):
Subject: Guidelines for the Cardiff Integration Process How does the Council intend to develop a common set of guidelines for the proper evaluation, follow-up and monitoring of the nine Council strategies, as well as the overall Cardiff Process, for environmental integration?
Will these guidelines include recommendations for a more transparent process and wider stakeholder participation in the development and implementation of the strategies?
How will the Council ensure full involvement of the European Parliament in the Cardiff Process?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the Council would like to reiterate that the Cardiff process has led six Council formations to present strategies to the European Council that seek to integrate the environment into their policies.
These strategies concerned the transport, energy, agriculture, industry, internal market and development cooperation sectors.
The General Affairs, ECOFIN and Fisheries Councils plan to present the three latest relevant strategies to the Barcelona European Council in the spring of 2002.
The nine integration strategies must be implemented in the form of sectoral measures, adopted by the majority, through co-decision with the European Parliament.
In addition to the Cardiff process, we must highlight the Lisbon process, which integrates the 1997 Luxembourg social process on employment with the 1999 Cologne macro-economic process, which was given a third dimension in Gothenburg, an environmental dimension, made up of the strategy for sustainable development, which also seeks to achieve integration of the environment into sectoral policies.
The European Union will present all this to the Global Summit on Sustainable Development which, as you know, will be held in Johannesburg in September 2002.
By creating this strategy on sustainable development, the European Council has given priority, in terms of the environment, to climate change, to ecologically viable methods of transport, to the responsible management of natural resources and, lastly, to the management of risks to public health.
Whilst continuing to function independently, the Cardiff process has been assessed and monitored since its launch in 1998, with results which are now integrated into the enlarged framework of the Lisbon process.
The implementation of the strategy on sustainable development must, as decided at Gothenburg, be based on four points.
The first point is an annual synthesis report by the Commission, which will now concern the three dimensions of the Lisbon process, including the strategy on sustainable development.
A report of the same kind will also have to be presented to the Barcelona European Council.
The second point is an evaluation and a political direction at the spring European Councils.
The third point concerns structural indicators on sustainable development which will be, on the basis of a Commission communication, endorsed by the Council before being submitted to the Laeken European Council.
The fourth and final point is a Commission communication on better regulation, which will mean that all the major proposals from this institution will be assessed beforehand for their effects on the strategy on sustainable development, including integration of the environmental dimension.
The Council is currently working to implement the conclusions of the European Council on the structures of work.
These will be designed with particular consideration given to the principles of governance in terms of transparency, stakeholder participation, better methods for regulation and the re-focusing of Community policies.
Trying to put the principles of environmental sustainability into practice is no easy task.
The Council is actually inventing the wheel.
The impression that many of us have is that the discussions are taking place behind closed doors.
I wonder whether the presidency is trying to open the discussion up, increase the transparency of the process and perhaps involve other organisations such as NGOs in the development of strategies.
I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council in particular what is being done to press for the working groups to identify specific medium-term objectives, clear targets and programmes of action, so that we have something to get our teeth into and have a demonstrable means of measuring progress and achievement?
I share your concern regarding transparency and openness, so that we can have specific indicators and results.
I also share your concern to take into account the views, advice or specific results from other organisations, particularly NGOs.
I have taken careful note of your suggestion, of your request to increase transparency and the involvement of all those who are helping to draw up strategies on sustainable development in the field.
I do hope that in showing transparency, the Council will also be able to integrate the results that you mention in order to ensure that these indicators on sustainable development, which are being prepared and are due to be submitted to the Laeken European Council, can, as part of the process and in the run-up to Barcelona, be improved from the point of view of both transparency and their repercussions or in terms of taking into account the views of all those who are working specifically in the field in the area of sustainable development.
Mr President, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Cardiff process is essential for sustainable development.
The European Parliament, and especially its Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has already carried out very good preliminary work here, and I think that in this House, transparency and, of course, dialogue can really be taken for granted.
We very often hold hearings here and make every effort to maximise dialogue with non-government organisations.
My question relates to this issue.
We have just concluded the WTO negotiations.
What opportunities do you see to coordinate the Cardiff process in consultation with the WTO organisations?
Mr President, your concern regarding both transparency and correspondence or coherence between, firstly, the outcome of the Doha Summit, the final details of which we are awaiting, and, secondly, the strategies on sustainable development, is extremely interesting.
Admittedly, as we saw at Doha, it is difficult, but interesting nonetheless, to integrate environmental policies into a much more multi-lateral context.
This is an important step forward, considering our starting point.
I think that this is a positive aspect and that, in the wake of the Doha Summit, we will now have to make the most of the achievements of Doha and use them within the framework of the measures that are to be implemented at European Union level, so as to ensure that sustainable development not only continues to be an honourable and bold ambition for everyone, but more importantly, translates itself, whilst observing the principle of transparency and following constructive dialogue, into specific measures in the field.
I therefore feel that the correspondence between the two parts, what was achieved within a wider forum and what was achieved or is in the process of being achieved at European Union level and, in particular, what must be achieved at the Laeken and Barcelona Councils, should be coherent and should be the milestones of a structural position, that is specific and conducive to the integration of sustainable development in all the policies implemented at Council and European Union level in general.
Question No 4 by (H-0781/01):
Subject: Landing of large numbers of illegal immigrants in the Canary Islands What measures does the Council intend to put forward to guarantee the integrity of Community waters around the Canary Islands, given the recent reports that motherships are being used to land large numbers of illegal immigrants from Africa on the Canaries?
Mr President, the Council has already responded, on several occasions, to the questions from Members of the European Parliament on illegal immigration by sea from the African continent.
In particular, I refer to the answers to oral questions H-2701, H-0330/01 and H-0699/01 on illegal immigration in the European Union, and to the answers to written questions E-0085/01 and E-1045/01, which also tackled these problems.
The Council has already taken several measures to combat illegal immigration.
The action plans that have been drawn up for the countries and regions producing illegal immigrants and/or asylum seekers, within the framework of the High Level Asylum and Immigration Group, is a good example of one such measure.
Another example is that of the rapid alert system that was developed within the Centre for Information, Discussion and Exchange on the Crossing of Frontiers and Immigration (Cirefi).
Measures to improve the effectiveness of checks by Member States at maritime borders were launched as part of cooperation under the Schengen Agreement.
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force, these measures are now part of the Community acquis.
Of course, Member States are responsible for performing these checks, and the surveillance of and checks on territorial waters are therefore a matter of their competence.
The Council also stresses that the preparatory bodies are currently looking into introducing a good practice guide, the aim of which is to assist Member States in carrying out these checks.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the Presidency of the Council will realise that I am not satisfied by references to mere written declarations.
The current situation in the Canary Islands amounts to a genuine invasion.
Approximately one hundred people are arriving every week and, furthermore, we are sending them to the rest of the Community.
A week ago, the Mayor of the city of Las Palmas in Gran Canaria sent two hundred immigrants to Madrid with one-way tickets.
If the European Union does not look after this border, I can assure you that we will have a real invasion, which is going to change all the parameters.
Perhaps my supplementary question should be, in relation to certain replies I received yesterday from Commissioner Vitorino on the Commission' s new proposals, whether the Council is considering those Commission proposals on the control of external borders, on immigration agreements with neighbouring countries and on the return of illegal immigrants in the EU to the countries of origin.
Mr President, I can understand that you feel the answer that I have given on behalf of the Council may be insufficient in terms of a situation that gives you cause for concern and which you feel is extremely important.
As I have just said, I can only refer to the competence of Member States regarding decisions taken at Community level.
It is up to Member States, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, to implement the necessary measures that were drawn up within the context of the Community.
Question No 5 by , which has been taken over by Mr Ortuondo Larrea (H-0783/01):
Subject: Reference to nationalism in the conclusions of the European Council meeting of 21 September 2001 Following the horrific terrorist attacks which took place on 11 September and their tragic consequences, people in the United States reacted strongly, with clear expressions of nationalism or patriotism based on the democratic and moral values which underpin North American society.
It was out of a similar form of democratic nationalism that most of the current Member States of the European Union were born in the face of despotic power.
The fact that certain European states acted in a violent and imperialistic manner and were thus the cause of the tragic wars which have marked Europe's history should in no way detract from the peaceful aspirations which characterise the democratic nationalism to be found in most European countries.
It is therefore surprising to note that, in the conclusions of the European Council meeting of 21 September 2001, which was held in response to the terrorist attacks against US citizens, the term 'nationalism' is once more used indiscriminately as being equivalent to racism and xenophobia. This is quite clearly offensive to all those Europeans who see themselves as peaceful, democratic and caring members of a nation and part of a national culture, as well as members of the European and world community.
Does the Council not agree that it is manifestly unfair to link nationalism with racism and xenophobia in such an indiscriminate manner?
The Council would reiterate that it is not up to the Council to comment on the conclusions of the European Council.
In this case, it is also beneficial to highlight that, in its conclusions of 21 September 2001, the European Council emphasises the need to combat any nationalist, racist or xenophobic drift.
I shall stress this - any nationalist drift, which is not the same thing as nationalism.
The term 'nationalism' does not actually appear in the text.
The only terms that appear are 'drifts, abuses, in nationalist, racist or xenophobic terms' .
And in this respect, I do not believe that the position taken by the Council does contradict the position that you expressed in your question.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the European Council has been able to differentiate between Arab and Muslim religion and society, on the one hand, and fanatical Islamic terrorist groups on the other.
However, in its conclusions of 21 September, the European Council expresses the need, as you have said, to combat any nationalist tendency, as if to be nationalist were a crime in itself or an attack on human rights.
Does the Council not agree that to stress the need to combat peaceful nationalism, which defends the universal right to free self-determination, something which the United Nations approved, by exclusively democratic means, could be seen as a display of intolerance and fascism on the part of the governments of the European Union?
While it is true that there are radical nationalist groups, which support terrorism, there are also violent groups with unionist or environmentalist ideologies which also commit violent acts.
Does the Council therefore believe that we should combat British unionism or environmentalism, for example, in all its forms?
Would it not be better to show prudence and democratic respect whenever we refer to nationalism, unionism, environmentalism or any other ideology?
I confirm what I just said. There is no reference to nationalism being a non-democratic movement in itself.
There are references here to abuses and drifts, be they racist, xenophobic, exclusionist, but nationalism in itself is not referred to as something that generates these drifts.
On the other hand, nationalism can sometimes be used for much more extremist purposes which should be condemned outright.
This is also the case in the area of political action, where democratic political actions benefit democracy as a whole and the freedom of expression.
Each time there are drifts, however, they are dangerous and they must be stamped out.
I am grateful for the President-in-Office of the Council's last remarks.
I belong to a national movement in my own country, Scotland, which over the last 100 years has produced great constitutional change without a single drop of human blood being shed or a single act of violence occurring.
There are other places, as she knows, where similar constitutional changes have taken place and are continuing.
The Council and the President-in-Office of the Council are perhaps wilfully missing the point in Mr Nogueira Román's question.
It is a great mistake to say that there are some ends that tend to attract terrorism and therefore to attack those ends in themselves.
The truth is that a terrorist is someone who thinks that an end justifies any means.
It is absurd to believe that if the end is noble any means can be justified.
Those who believe that, make whatever end they seek ignoble.
I wish the Council would be less selective in its attitude to such questions.
I share your point of view and I would also like to reiterate that, given the debate we have just had on the international situation, in regard to nationalism, as I said, or in other areas, and I shall use the example of religion, which is particularly topical in terms of current events in Afghanistan, the Council clearly believes that religion forms part of one' s private life, is a matter of individual choice. I shall take Islam as an example.
Islam has nothing to do with the scandalous and abusive way that it has been treated by terrorists who use it in a way that borders on the disgraceful and to achieve vastly different goals.
I can only repeat, in answer to your question, the Council' s belief is that, in Europe and throughout the world, we must also respect a democratic Islam, which, in fact, belongs to the sphere of one' s private life, or which is expressed in a legitimate way, but also to combat any form of religious expression which pursues any other scandalously repressive goal.
Just to clarify the comments by my honourable colleague, Mr MacCormick, it was, in fact, the 1997 election of a Labour government which delivered the historic Scottish parliament that was democratically elected in 1999.
If it had not been for that Labour government we would not have a Scottish parliament.
I would remind Members that this is exclusively a Question Time.
These clarifications can be made later outside the chamber.
Question No 6 by (H-0784/01):
Subject: Illegal immigration into Greece from Turkey - breach of accession partnership There has been an enormous upsurge in illegal immigration into Greece from Turkey, with thousands of clandestine immigrants reaching Greek shores aboard Turkish smugglers' boats.
The Turkish authorities make no attempt to prevent such immigration, which is in breach of the accession partnership, while the measures taken by the Greek authorities are inadequate to stem the constant flood of illegal immigrants on to Greek territory and, by extension, into the EU.
Bearing in mind the climate of insecurity created by uncontrolled immigration into the EU, which was intensified by the terrorist attacks in the USA, what is the Council's position on the flow of illegal immigrants from Turkey?
What measures will the Council take in regard to Turkey as an applicant for EU accession, pursuant to the conditions laid down in the accession partnership concerning the prevention of illegal immigration and the strengthening of border management with a view to the adoption of the Schengen acquis, in order to prevent illegal immigrants entering Greece and to guarantee the security of the EU's borders?
In response to Mr Trakatellis' question, the Council has often expressed its concern regarding illegal immigration and also refers in this connection to the conclusions of the Tampere, Santa Maria de Feira and Nice European Councils, for example.
Regarding the measures that it has taken and is continuing to take in this area, the Council kindly asks you to refer to the answers that have already been given to numerous questions submitted by Members of the European Parliament on illegal immigration.
The Council reiterates that the Helsinki European Council decided to consider Turkey as a candidate country which aims to join the European Union on the basis of the same criteria as those that are applied to the other candidate countries.
The Helsinki European Council stated that, and I quote, 'with a view to intensifying the harmonisation of Turkey' s legislation and practice with the acquis, the Commission is invited to prepare a process of analytical examination of the acquis' .
In accordance with the conclusions of the Feira European Council, the Commission will report back to the Council on the progress made in preparing the analytical examination of the acquis with Turkey.
The Council formally adopted the accession partnership with Turkey on 8 March 2000.
Under this accession partnership, Turkey adopted a national programme for adopting the acquis, which sets out the framework for the policy to be pursued and the timetable of legislative work, as well as the budgetary and administrative requirements that are necessary in order for Turkey to adopt the Community acquis.
In line with the practice established for all candidate countries, the Commission will assess Turkey' s national programme for adopting the acquis in the 2001 regular report on the basis of the accession partnership.
The European Union will closely monitor the implementation of the various measures announced as part of this framework.
The national programme on the acquis contains various measures in the area of justice and home affairs.
The main objectives on which progress was made during 2001 include the strengthening of border checks, the harmonisation of legislation and practices concerning visas with the European Union acquis, and, lastly, the adoption of the acquis in the area of immigration in order to prevent illegal immigration.
The Council again stated its concern given the enormous influx of illegal immigrants from Turkey into Greece or transiting through Greece.
The European Union asked Turkey to implement appropriate measures as laid out in the European Union report of November 2000.
The EU is also keen to help Turkey financially in pursuing the implementation of the recommended approach, in line with the accession partnership.
In this respect, the Council noted with interest Turkey' s intention to waive, in the medium term, the geographical proviso formulated with regard to the 1951 Geneva Convention on the status of refugees.
The Council also engaged in active dialogue with countries that produce asylum seekers and/or illegal immigrants within the framework of the High Level Asylum and Immigration group.
As I said earlier in my reply to the question by another Member regarding the Canary Islands, this group, set up by the Council in December 1998, has the task of drawing up action plans for specific countries.
In order to draw up these action plans, the group adopted a global, trans-pillar approach, taking into account aspects relating to foreign policy, economic development and also the management of migratory flows.
One of the countries chosen for this action plan is Iraq, since it is a country that produces immigrants and which immigrants transit through.
Because of its geographical situation, Turkey is obviously an important country of transit.
As part of the action plan for Iraq, the Council has already launched a dialogue with Turkey in order to implement the European Union action plan concerning Iraq of 26 January 1998.
One of the measures under the action plan is to negotiate a transit agreement with Turkey.
I welcome the Council's lengthy reply but I still have two questions. As the Prime Minister of Greece, Mr Simitis, has said, we are working on an assumption of 260 000 illegal immigrants this year.
Tell me, if you can, how two hundred and sixty thousand illegal immigrants can possibly pass through Turkey unnoticed?
This being so, exactly what action has the Council taken with respect to Turkey, with its candidate status and partnership agreement, to make it improve its border patrols and prevent these huge numbers of illegal immigrants?
Secondly, and more importantly, what exactly does the Council have in mind?
Is it in a position to design a joined-up policy to ensure that this matter is resolved satisfactorily and that borders and illegal immigration are safely controlled?
Of course, political asylum seekers are seeking political asylum, but there still has to be some form of control.
Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to confirm what I just said regarding the Council' s action to effectively implement the things that were decided on as part of the Turkish action plan. Furthermore, with regard to the more general question of migration, I acknowledge and the Council also freely acknowledges that, due to its geographical situation, Turkey is a country in a peculiar situation.
And now, we are all acquainted with the consequences of this situation that you have highlighted. I would like to point out that, under the Belgian Presidency, we have in fact organised, for the first time, a conference, held in Brussels some weeks ago, on the issue of migration.
This was a European Conference which was held as part of a necessary investigation into the issue of migratory movements. I think that this debate must run its course, and the Belgian Presidency wanted to launch this, independently of any decisions taken with regard to Turkey or Iraq, as part of the discussions that Europe is holding with both Turkey under the statute that was conferred upon it, and with non-European and non-candidate countries, to attempt to better manage the problems related to these migratory fluctuations.
The point I should like to make to the Minister is that there is a huge contradiction where Turkey is concerned.
On the one hand, it allows huge numbers of migrants to pass through it and, on the other, a stream of political refugees from Turkey itself or from other countries but who are open to prosecution in Turkey, such as Iraqi Kurds who might be prosecuted for their activities in Turkey, is turning up in Greece.
How can these two things be reconciled?
By which I mean making Turkey stop, with the possible refoulement of immigrants entering the Community illegally via Greece, while at the same time protecting all those seeking political asylum, given that Turkey is a country which practises the death penalty and, as we saw in the Commission's progress report yesterday, a country in which democracy is sorely lacking?
The President-in-Office of the Council does not consider it appropriate to reply to the following question.
She probably considers it not to be a question but rather a declaration by the Member.
It is up to the President-in-Office of the Council.
Question No 7 by (H-0788/01):
Subject: Statements by Mr Berlusconi Recently, the Prime Minister of Italy, Mr Berlusconi, made statements which essentially put the mass demonstrations calling for a different kind of globalisation on a par with terrorism.
He also proceeded to make a number of comparisons and judgments about Western and Islamic civilisation which betrayed an ignorance of history and which the President-in-Office of the Council, the Belgian Foreign Minister, Mr Michel, described as barbaric, absurd and untrue.
In view of the fact that Mr Berlusconi's statements are totally contrary to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, as signed and proclaimed by the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission at the European Council meeting in Nice on 7 December 2000, can the Council state its official and collective position on this matter?
Mr President, it is, of course, not up to the Council to comment on the statements made by Mr Berlusconi.
The Council would like to reiterate the terms used by the European Council in its conclusions, at the outcome of the extraordinary meeting held in Brussels on 21 September.
The European Council, issuing an appeal to the international community to pursue, in all multilateral fora, dialogue and negotiation with a view to building, in Europe and elsewhere, a world of peace, law and tolerance, also emphasised the need to combat any racist and xenophobic drift and to reject any equation of terrorism with the Arab or Muslim world.
From this perspective, there is no doubt that the official and concerted position, which you have been hoping and praying for, was already taken by the Council at its sitting of 21 September.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, my question touched on two issues.
First, Mr Berlusconi's views, if I may call them such, on Arabs and Islam.
It seems to me from what you have read out that the Council begs to differ from, not to say condemns these views.
And that is good news.
But I asked you a second question, Madam President-in-Office of the Council.
In his statements, Mr Berlusconi equated the huge demonstrations being held all over the world, in both Europe and America, by people who believe that globalisation could take a different form and a different direction, with terrorism.
In other words, he equated these demonstrations with terrorism.
What is the Council's view on this issue, which is an extremely important issue and one which will no doubt crop up again in the future?
Mr President, I would like to reiterate that it is not for the Council to comment on the statements made by Mr Berlusconi and others, not only on the aspects related to Islam or any other equation of terrorism with the Arab world, but also on issues related to globalisation.
I stand by the actions and the positions of the Council, which were adopted on 21 September and which I believe give a clear indication of the European Council' s point of view, regarding its determination to reject any equation of this sort.
It is not for the Council to comment or issue an opinion on the statements made by Mr Berlusconi either.
Question No 8 by (H-0791/01):
Subject: Inclusion of additional data on new EU identity cards The recent terrorist attacks in the USA have given rise to intense debate over whether more detailed information about an individual's characteristics and origin should be included on identity cards in the Member States of the Union.
The Greek press reports that this issue will be discussed early next December in Brussels at the meeting of the Ministers of Justice, Internal Affairs and Public Order of the 15 Member States of the EU.
Will the Council therefore say whether the deliberations which take place between those Ministers will also cover the following additional data to define more clearly the identity of European citizens and, in more general terms, EU residents: fingerprints, colour of eyes and hair, height, weight, blood group and subgroup, visible scars and other physical distinguishing features, hair growth, disabilities, nationality, place of birth, religion, family status, occupation, and academic qualifications.
I would request a specific answer for each of the above mentioned points. Will the deliberations also cover the possibility of adding further characteristics to existing passports in all the UN Member States and, if so, which characteristics?
I would like to thank you for asking this question, as it gives the Council the opportunity to clear up what is obviously a huge misunderstanding on the part of the Greek press.
At an extraordinary session on 20 September 2001, organised in response to the events of 11 September, the Justice, Home Affairs and Civil Protection Council held a wide debate on measures to be taken as part of the fight against international terrorism.
It is true that the Council discussed including bio data, but only on visas to be issued to third country nationals.
As a follow-up to this debate, the Commission recently asked the Council to submit a proposal for a regulation to enhance the security of this category of visas, by including a digital photograph on these, so that we can ensure that the passport holder really is the person to whom the document was issued.
The Council would very much appreciate Parliament' s issuing an opinion on this new proposal as soon as possible.
Lastly, you are almost certainly aware that identity cards of Member States' nationals are an area that falls within the exclusive remit of each of the Member States.
I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her extremely clear reply to my question.
She has confirmed that the Council is discussing the inclusion of other information on passports or visas, such as a digital photograph, an extremely important element, and additional biometric data.
Could you perhaps be more specific, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, as regards what additional information you are discussing. Will it include biometric information other than a fingerprint and will it also include the person's religion?
This issue is of particular interest to Greece.
I should also like to ask why you only plan to request information on the identity of third country nationals and not European Union nationals.
As far as I know, the European Union has its share of terrorists, for example in Spain and Greece.
Should we not be making it easier for European police forces to locate European terrorists?
I obviously wanted to be sure that the answer I gave was accurate.
In fact, this does not only concern visas and, with respect to the data provided, this only regards digital fingerprinting.
I can today reassure you on the issue of religion, for example.
I think that it is important for Parliament, as I suggested, to issue an opinion on this proposal as soon as possible so that we can then forge ahead.
But I can reassure you that we do not mean digital fingerprinting.
Question No 9 by (H-0795/01):
Subject: Age discrimination Does the Council propose to change its current policy of discriminating against job applicants aged 45 and over in the light of the European Ombudsman's current investigation into whether such age discrimination amounts to maladministration?
The Council does not consider that setting an age limit of 45 years for the recruitment of civil servants at the starting grade constitutes discrimination in itself, because the difference in treatment established by this limit, on the one hand, is in line with the Treaty on establishing the European Community as well as the civil servants' statute and, on the other, is based on objective reasons, particularly relating to the concept of a career, which is at the heart of Community work.
This consideration was twice brought to the attention of the European Ombudsman.
We must also emphasise that the age limit is raised systematically, and up to a maximum of six years, in order to take into account family commitments, such as bringing up children, military service or physical handicap.
The age limit is also raised in some other cases, in order to meet specific recruitment requirements due to the staff needs or the new requirements of an institution.
This was the case, for example, for the recruitment of Nordic language translators and this also happened more recently for posts advertised for political and military staff.
The Council' s General Secretariat would not deprive itself of the experience of an older candidate if this experience was indispensable, but it must also ensure that younger staff are recruited to fulfil the permanent tasks of the institution, such as translation or administration.
Lastly, you drew attention to the fact that the process to undertake administrative reform and strengthen inter-institutional cooperation that is underway intends to establish an inter-institutional recruitment office.
The question regarding age limit has not been touched upon during the preparatory work carried out to establish this office.
The issue is also likely to be raised when reviewing the proposals on the reform of the statute, on which the Council, in its role of legislator, will be asked to comment.
Whilst we await the results of this work, which should enable common rules for all the institutions to be drawn up, it does not seem appropriate to change the current practice used by the Council' s General Secretariat in the recruitment of civil servants at the starting grade of a career. The practice appears to be in line with the rules of law and is also in the interests of the institution.
I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply.
I was alerted to this issue of age discrimination in the Council at our previous part-session when I was asked what I thought.
My immediate reaction was that, while on the one hand we are trying to encourage fairer treatment of older workers, yet, on the other hand, in one of our own EU institutions - and from what the minister said in more than one - we are discriminating against those aged 45 and over.
It is a sad state of affairs when those aged 45 are not considered for employment.
What talent, knowledge and experience is lost because of this!
I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council what measures are being taken to treat all job applications equally?
It was interesting to hear about the inter-institutional recruitment office.
What is the time-scale for its creation and what common rules will all institutions have?
I just wish to clarify something you said.
The base age has been raised by six years.
Does that mean it has been raised to 51 or has 39 been raised to 45?
Mr President, I just wanted to answer one of the specific supplementary questions that were asked.
The limit is effectively set at 45 years, and it is not possible to recruit anyone over 51 years of age.
Therefore this is a specific answer to one of the specific questions that I was asked as a result.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 10 and 11 will be taken together.
Question No 10 by (H-0796/01):
Subject: Specific measures to provide refuge and support for the Afghan population Given the current situation and the risk of a full blown humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan, what effective action and measures is the Council going to take to prevent hundreds of thousands of women and innocent people being made the victims of indiscriminate violence or of cold and hunger?
Will the Council be opening humanitarian corridors and seeking political solutions?
Question No 11 by (H-0825/01):
Subject: Wave of Afghan refugees at the gates of Europe For a number of years, Turkey has been one of the main points of entry into Europe for economic migrants and political refugees.
Following the terrorist attack in the USA, Afghans seeking shelter from the brutal Taliban regime and, above all, from the war, now make up the bulk of refugees on the move.
Reliable sources report that tens of thousands of Afghan refugees are preparing to make the crossing from Turkey to Greece and Italy.
In the Council's view, what is the status of the Afghan refugees?
Are they entitled to political asylum?
Is a quota system being considered to accommodate them in European countries?
Is there any form of cooperation with the Turkish authorities?
What view does the Council take of the conditions in which they are 'housed' in Italy and Greece (immigrant reception centres, etc.)?
What measures can the Council take in cooperation with the Greek and Italian authorities?
Mr President, as it has indicated in previous answers on the same subject, the Council fully shares your concerns regarding the humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan.
At its session on 8 and 9 October 2001, the Council reaffirmed that the European Union and its Member States are doing everything possible in order to avoid a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and in the neighbouring countries, which must be organised in close collaboration with the HCR and other specialised agencies, the International Red Cross Committee, the United States, neighbouring countries and other partners from multinational organisations.
On this occasion, the Council reiterated that, faced with the humanitarian crisis, the Community and its Member States have already released EUR 316 million.
The Council warmly welcomed the first steps taken by the Commission to assist refugees and has invited the Commission to present further measures as soon as possible.
In this respect, I would like to stress that the reserve for urgent aid, which amounts to EUR 25 million, to be used for humanitarian aid to help the Afghan people, was already approved at a budgetary tripartite meeting on 15 October.
Furthermore, the Council restated the European Union' s determination to support, when required, a political process launched in Afghanistan, with the support of the United Nations, and to contribute to the reconstruction, modernisation, development and opening up of the country.
Current events confirm the need for us to work towards this.
The Council is in favour of opening humanitarian corridors but it stresses that this requires the cooperation of the forces in control of the situation on the ground.
In this context, the Council deeply regrets that the Taliban regime has, on several occasions, obstructed the delivery of humanitarian aid, harassed NGOs, destroyed humanitarian buildings, refused to cooperate with international institutions and, very recently, demanded that convoys, trying to deliver humanitarian aid to the needy Afghan people, pay road tolls.
Given the current situation in Afghanistan, it is obviously difficult to ensure that any measure can be totally efficient.
However, you will no doubt be aware that the European Union, whilst fully supportive of the efforts undertaken to eradicate terrorism in the wake of the attacks of 11 September, is taking an active part in the humanitarian operation designed to assist the displaced people in the region.
The position of the Council, when faced with such situations, has always been to work to keep displaced populations within the neighbouring regions, in order to facilitate their return, as soon as circumstances allow.
I would reiterate that, on 20 July 2001, the Council adopted a directive on the temporary protection, on the territory of Member States, of displaced persons in the event of a massive influx.
Since this directive will not be applied until December 2002, the Commission stated, at the Council meeting of 27 and 28 September, that it was willing to investigate how the rules specified under this directive could be applied, if necessary, before this date.
From this perspective, the Commission has recently requested Member States to provide, on a fortnightly basis to Eurostat, statistical data on asylum requests and illegal entries of Afghan citizens.
The Council does not have any information on the conditions in reception centres.
And, in relation to this, I would like to say that the Council bodies are currently examining a proposal for a directive to set minimum standards for conditions in reception centres for asylum seekers in the Member States.
Lastly, with regard to relations with Turkey, I reiterate that regular meetings take place between the Council bodies and Turkey, as part of the implementation of the action plan for Iraq drawn up by the High Level Asylum and Immigration Group, as I also explained in answer to a previous question.
The next meeting is most likely to take place towards the end of November.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for your reply.
The serious problem we have is that all that European Union aid, those many millions of euros, is being channelled by means of Pakistan.
Pakistan is the only country - together with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - which has been supporting the Taliban regime.
It is a mistake to give the key to, and the administration of, the humanitarian aid to Pakistan.
However, that is what is happening, and this political error is the reason why the aid is not reaching all the Afghan beneficiaries who should be receiving it.
Madam President, now that Kabul has been taken, could you please change this so that European Union humanitarian aid is not channelled via Pakistan, as has been the case up to now. Let us not give the key and the administration to Pakistan, but let us do it directly so that it reaches the people of Afghanistan.
I shall start by thanking the President-in-Office of the Council and the Belgian Presidency's entire team which, perhaps because it includes so many women, has given us some excellent replies.
What you said about the provisions of the directive on a mass influx of displaced persons being applied before it is applied in the Member States was most interesting.
Having said which, I should like to ask if, in cases such as that in Greece, where 700 people, mostly from Afghanistan and Iraqi Kurdistan, turned up in Zakynthos, Greece could apply the provisions of the directive, including making use of funds from the European Refugee Fund?
I would like to reiterate what I said in my first answer to the joint question regarding the early application of the directive.
This obviously applies to all Member States.
It is also from this perspective that we requested the statistical data to be provided to Eurostat on a regular basis, in order to be able to consider the early application of the directive due to the situation, which, at the time, could not be predicted.
As for the other points, as far as the delivery of humanitarian aid is concerned, this is basically a matter for the Commission and, since this is the case, it is difficult for the Council to take a position on this subject.
I shall take careful note of the comments regarding the aid deliveries.
Question No 12 by (H-0797/01):
Subject: Death sentence for 16 Afghans for converting to another religion In Afghanistan, a prosecutor has brought 16 Afghans before a court in Kabul demanding that they be sentenced to death.
They are being charged with conversion from Islam to Christianity, and the prosecutor is demanding the death penalty for all of them in accordance with the Taliban regime's Islamic laws.
In a trial taking place at the same time in Kabul, eight aid workers with Shelter Now International have been charged with carrying out Christian missionary work.
Here, too, the prosecution is calling for all of them to be sentenced to death in accordance with the country's Islamic laws.
Germany, the USA and Australia are making diplomatic efforts to protect the eight aid workers' interests and ensure legal certainty.
In a previous answer I received in the Chamber, the Commission stated that the three countries had said the European Union therefore does not need to become involved in the case.
However, there have been no international diplomatic efforts, on the part either of individual countries or of the European Union, to assist the 16 Afghans who have been charged.
Throughout the world, the European Union actively supports the abolition of the death penalty and religious freedom based on tolerance and respect for different beliefs.
How is this reflected in the Council's actions in the case of the 16 Afghans who have changed religion?
What is the European Union doing, via the Council, to follow and monitor the trial of the 16 Afghans facing the death penalty in Kabul, and to influence its outcome, and what concrete steps have been taken to ensure that they enjoy legal certainty and protection and that their lives are spared?
The Council shares your concerns about the citizens of Afghanistan and foreign aid workers who are accused by the Taliban of religion conversion and preaching, and who are therefore facing the very serious threat of the death penalty.
The position of the Council with regard to the death penalty is well known.
The promotion and the respect of fundamental human rights, including the freedom of religion and belief, are an essential part of European Union policy on third countries and are, thus, included in the common position of the European Union on Afghanistan.
The main international legal instruments ensure that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
This right covers the freedom to change religion or belief and the freedom to express, alone or collectively, in public or in private, one' s religion or belief.
The European Union has expressed its concerns regarding the human rights situation in Afghanistan on an international stage, particularly to the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, at which all EU Member States supported the draft resolution tabled by Italy on human rights violations in Afghanistan.
Given that the EU Member States do not recognise the Taliban government, it is extremely difficult to communicate with them and to gain access to territories under their control.
This was also the case before 11 September 2001.
The bilateral diplomatic efforts to protect foreign aid workers, which have been made by diplomats from Germany, the United States and Australia from Islamabad, have not yet had any tangible results.
Since military action began in Afghanistan on 7 October, it has become even more difficult, of course, to closely monitor the fate of the 16 Afghan citizens mentioned in the honourable Member' s question and to contribute to a political resolution of this matter.
Believe me, this is something I regret, but you will also understand that the situation is now even more difficult to assess than before.
I would thank the Belgian Presidency most sincerely for that answer.
It was characterised by commitment and a genuine desire to do its best for these people.
Kabul has fallen.
The Taliban regime is fleeing.
Afghanistan faces a new future.
In that scenario, I really want you in the Belgian Presidency to do everything you can to obtain information about these 16 Afghans who are threatened by the death penalty.
Are they still there in Kabul?
Have they been taken to Kandahar?
Can we rescue them?
What has happened to the eight aid workers from Shelter Now International?
I should be extremely glad if the Belgian Presidency were able to report here in Parliament that all 24 of these people had been found and were free and alive.
It is my wish that you in the Belgian Presidency should do everything you can.
There are new opportunities now that Kabul has been opened up. I would ask you if you believe you can obtain some information before the end of the year.
As the author is not present, Question No 13 lapses.
Question No 14 by (H-0806/01):
Subject: Priorities in the fisheries sector during the second half of the Belgian Presidency Will the Council, under the Belgian Presidency, outline its priorities for the fisheries sector during the second half of its term of office, taking into account the particular and unique requirements of peripheral countries such as Ireland which has 11% of Community waters in its jurisdiction but only 4% of Community quotas?
The Council refers you to the answer that it has already given to the same question asked at the September session of Question Time. The answer deals with the presidency' s intentions regarding the timetable of the Council debate on the Commission' s Green Paper, the extension of the multiannual guidance programmes and the rebuilding of those stocks at risk, as well as touching upon the issue of the redeployment of the fishing fleet and of fishermen who were dependent upon the fisheries agreement with Morocco.
Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her response, even though it was very short and curt.
Would the President-in-Office of the Council agree that fisheries are important to peripheral maritime areas throughout the Union where there is no alternative source of employment?
Would she also accept that in my country, Ireland, the fishing industry has not benefited to any great extent from its membership of the European Union, because the most prolific fishing grounds within a reasonable limit of our coast are being plundered by greedy maritime states within the Union.
Would she, during her term of office between now and the end of the year, investigate what could be done for areas right around the Irish coast, including my own area in the west of Ireland, which once had prolific fishing grounds that have certainly not been plundered by our small inshore fleet?
Would she also accept that regional development policies and fisheries policies should not be looked at in isolation, but in tandem?
The Council has given an answer to this question on several previous occasions. Of course, I understand the importance and relevance of this issue from Mr Gallagher' s point of view, but other than that, I stand by what I have said, and also reiterate that the Council had already stated its intentions regarding extensions, annual programmes, rebuilding stocks and the redeployment of fishing fleets and fishermen.
I can, therefore, only confirm the previous answers given by the Council to this question, whilst I clearly understand that this issue is a particular concern to Mr Gallagher.
Mr President, you did not give the Belgian Presidency the opportunity to reply to my follow-up question subsequent to my Question No 12.
Normally a follow-up question is answered, and a follow-up question to Question No 14 has just now been answered.
I thought it was rather impolite not to give the Belgian Presidency the opportunity to answer.
Mr Sacrédeus, Mrs Durant, the President-in-Office of the Council, has declined to reply to the question in some cases because she considered that she had already answered it, but I will communicate your request to Mrs Durant in any case.
It is up to Mrs Durant to consider whether it is a question or whether it has already been answered.
In any event, Mrs Durant, if you have any message for the Member, or any reply, you have the floor.
I would simply like to confirm, Mr President, that, as I said in my detailed answer to your question regarding these 16 individuals, I obviously hope, as does everyone in the House, that these people can be spared.
That goes without saying.
And that, as far as possible, during our bilateral contacts, given the difficulty of the current situation, even if, perhaps, it gives rise to something positive, since, in the last 24 hours, we have witnessed the liberation of Kabul, and possibly of Kandahar, and the retreat by the Taliban, I sincerely hope that everything can be done to identify these people and to save their lives. However, I cannot commit to taking specific and particular measures here and now.
In any case, bear in mind that everything that can be done will be done, but today, the situation on the ground in Afghanistan is extremely complicated.
In my question on a point of order, what specifically I pointed out was that, in my follow-up question, I had indicated that a whole new situation had arisen in Afghanistan and Kabul now that the Taliban regime had fled the capital.
The situation was different when this question was put to the Belgian Presidency a month ago and when the Belgian Presidency prepared its answer.
A new opening exists. I would therefore thank the Belgian Presidency for the follow-up answer it has given me, to the effect that it will take action on the new situation in Afghanistan.
Question No 15 by (H-0807/01):
Subject: Revision of the common position on Cuba On 11 July 2001 I asked the Council whether it intended to revise the EU's common position on its relations with Cuba.
On 5 September I received a detailed and satisfactory written answer.
I also welcome the Belgian Presidency's initiative aimed at resuming the dialogue with Cuba, a country which has shown a strong interest in cooperating with Europe and counts the EU Member States as its main economic partners.
Now that the President-in-Office of the Council has visited Havana and conveyed his impressions to the Council, I should like to raise the matter once again. Does it not appear anachronistic and out-of-place that Cuba should be the only Latin American country with which the European Union has not signed any kind of cooperation agreement, largely owing to the EU's current 'common position' on Cuba?
Does or does not the Council consider that the time has come to revise and update that common position, which does not reflect the stance taken by each of the Member States towards Cuba, and the text of which appears obsolete, in addition to the fact that it has not had any effect in the direction which its supporters claimed to have expected?
Is it correct that, in the current debate within the Council on the revision of the EU's common position on Cuba, there is one national government which is fundamentally opposed to any such revision, thus effectively blocking an updating which is in our view right, urgent and vital?
Once again, this honourable Assembly is inviting the presidency of the Council to discuss relations between Cuba and the European Union.
I therefore hope to seize this opportunity to reiterate several points, and perhaps to clear up some misunderstandings regarding these relations.
The European Union' s common position on Cuba remains the basis of the European Union' s policy on this country.
As laid down in the Treaty on European Union, common positions are an instrument of the EU' s common, foreign and security policy (see Article 12) and the decisions concerning the common foreign and security policy are taken unanimously (see Article 23).
At the ninth revision of the common position on Cuba on 25 June, the Council noted that the common position was still valid.
The EU' s objectives regarding Cuba are as before: to encourage a process of peaceful transition towards democratic pluralism and the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
In parallel with this, the Council has always shown its willingness to maintain an open and constructive dialogue on all the issues of common interest.
In June, the Council restated its intention to maintain this approach.
It also showed a favourable opinion on establishing an open, political dialogue and on finding a future framework agreement on cooperation based on the respect of democratic principles, the principles of human rights and the rule of law.
It is also in this spirit that an exploratory mission by the European Union' s troika, led by the deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Louis Michel, visited Havana on 23 and 24 August 2001.
Moreover, at the ninth revision of the common position, the Council urged the European Commission to step up its efforts to cooperate, particularly with civil and non-governmental organisations in Cuba, to enable greater numbers of EU players on the ground to contribute more effectively in achieving the objectives of the common position.
Furthermore, and as you yourself point out, the Member States of the European Union are Cuba' s main economic partners.
However, we must remember that it was the Cuban authorities who broke off dialogue between the European Union and Cuba, when they cancelled the EU' s troika mission at Director-General level, virtually the day before it was due to take place, on 27 and 28 April 2000.
It was also the Cuban authorities that, in May 2000, withdrew their request to sign up to the Cotonou agreement.
In addition, and as the Council already noted at the ninth revision of the common position, there has so far been no firm indication that the Cuban government has had a change of policy and is moving towards achieving the objectives of the common position.
The next meeting between the Cuban Minister for Foreign Affairs and the EU troika has been scheduled, at Cuba' s request, to run in parallel with the 55th UN General Assembly which is currently underway, and, at this moment in time, I am as yet unable to give you any details of this second meeting.
Mr President, the Minister' s reply leads me to ask her whether she is aware that, a few weeks ago, a delegation from the European Parliament visited Cuba.
During that visit, our colleagues spoke to the Cuban authorities, to the church, to NGOs and to the eleven resident Ambassadors of the countries of the Union.
All of them, apart from one Ambassador, agreed that the common position is useless, because it does not contribute to the progress of the Cubans nor to the progress of relations between the European Union and Cuba.
Therefore, the Minister, President-in-Office of the Council, must know that that common position has been surpassed, it is obsolete and an anachronism. It is unjust and scandalous that Cuba is the only country in Latin America with which the European Union does not have any cooperation agreement, which puts it in a difficult position - in the disastrous situation it is in at the moment - in terms of helping with the reconstruction of what was destroyed by Hurricane Michelle.
Mr President, as I said to you in my answer, I do believe that the recent visit by the European Union troika and the meeting, which is currently being held in parallel to the United Nations General Assembly, will certainly be of use to the Council' s work in this area.
Nonetheless, I am committed to our will and our objectives which still aim to encourage a process of peaceful transition and above all to develop a dialogue, which is as frank, open and as constructive as it possibly can be, on all the issues of common interest.
I can only confirm therefore the benefits of these bilateral relations and hope that they are able to be of use to the future positions of the Council.
Thank you very much, Madam President-in-Office of the Council. Your reply was really very interesting.
I was a member of the delegation referred to by Miguel Ángel Martínez and I was able to witness the fact that NGOs, Ambassadors and even the so-called dissidents in Cuba consider the common position to be of little use.
I wanted to point out, Madam President, that if there are many Members here who feel the common position relating to Cuba is unjust, it is because, for example, we have a customs agreement with Turkey and we all know that Turkey does not comply with basic human rights.
In fact, the Kurdish Member of Parliament, Leyla Zana, who was awarded the Sakharov Prize, is in prison, and a European delegation has not been able to visit her over recent days.
We also have very special agreements with Morocco, another country which does not comply with human rights.
What we are saying is that the common position relating to Cuba demands that the latter make changes before we reach a cooperation agreement and that is what seems unfair to us, Madam President-in-Office of the Council.
We therefore always insist that this review - which is going to be at the last minute - should take account of the opinions of all these people in Cuba, and we also note that two different yardsticks are being used.
Although it is not a question, Mrs Durant can make a comment if she considers it appropriate.
Question No 16 by (H-0810/01):
Subject: Reversing depopulation in rural areas Has the Council, under the Belgian Presidency of the EU and in consultation with the forthcoming Spanish Presidency, considered the need for an active EU policy aimed at reversing depopulation in rural areas in the Member States, including Ireland, will it make a statement on the issues to be considered, including financial aspects, pilot projects, studies and involvement of relevant NGOs, and will it call on the Commission to publish a Communication on policies aimed at reversing depopulation in rural areas?
First of all, I would like to reiterate that, as part of the European regional policy and particularly in the current 2000-2006 programming period, there is the possibility of supporting economic and social redevelopment in Objective 2 rural areas, which have a population of less than 100 inhabitants per kilometre.
The Council would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, following the Commission' s presentation of the second report on economic and social cohesion, representatives from the Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament met last June, at the initiative of the Swedish Presidency of the Council, in Lycksele, in the north of Sweden, in order to share their experiences and discuss the future of depopulated zones, including rural areas, a matter on which the presidency that Belgium assumed this quarter, continues to work.
The Council believes that the first thing we must do, at this stage, is to seek to use the full potential of the current regulations in order to combat depopulation and impoverishment of specific rural areas.
This task is primarily down to the Member States, which should respect the criteria defined at Community level.
Given that the Commission' s proposals for the future programming period are not expected until 2004, the Council believes that it is still too early to launch a new debate on the implementation of European Union policy for rural areas that are depopulated or becoming depopulated, which would extend beyond what is currently in force.
I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her reply.
Does she agree that there is a need for greater coordination between national policies and those designed to achieve rural development objectives and that there should be more concentration on decentralisation and the creation of new employment opportunities in the regions?
What new action can now be taken to encourage and achieve this objective?
Will the President-in-Office of the Council ensure that this matter is placed on the agenda for further consideration by the Spanish Presidency?
I can only confirm what I have just said, in other words, that I believe, and the Council also believes, that the full potential of the current regulations must be exploited.
Given that this concerns a Community framework in which specific actions must be taken by Member States, I am in favour of going further in using the current regulations, rather than prematurely engaging in another debate on the implementation of a policy for these areas.
I think that the existing framework can be better exploited, not only at Community level, but also, and more importantly, at a lower level, in other words at the level of Member States which must strive to implement policies within the context of criteria defined at Community level.
Question No 17 by (H-0814/01):
Subject: European citizenship, students and state benefits Has the Council considered the conclusions of the European Court of Justice handed down in its ruling of 20 September 2001 (following a case brought by a French student studying in Belgium who had been refused a minimum living allowance) which confirm that students living in a Member State other than their own are entitled to the same benefits as nationals of the host state and that the judgment was retroactive, and the immediate implications for all the Member States resulting from that judgment?
Judgment EC 184/99 that you mention, Mr Crowley, was only handed down on 20 September 2001.
The Council has not yet had an opportunity to study the full implications of the issue and, as is standard practice, the Council will respect the judgment of the Court and will, of course, draw conclusions from this.
In any case, it is up to the Member States to draw conclusions from the judgment.
This is a rather short answer, but this is simply because the judgment has only very recently been handed down.
I appreciate and understand the constraints which the President-in-Office of the Council has with this question.
However, on a number of occasions in this House I have raised the issue with regard to, in particular, Erasmus students who have been treated differently in different Member States.
One of the consequences of this judgment is that there will now be an obligation on all Member States to ensure that there is a common system available to give assistance to those students who are in Erasmus programmes or who are studying in full-time programmes in countries other than their own Member States.
Therefore I ask the President-in-Office of the Council to bring up this matter immediately at the next Council meeting, if possible so that there will be no more delays, so that opportunities will no longer be denied to many students who have not benefited up to now, or whose parents have had to pay for them to study abroad; and so that these anomalies and inequalities will be removed in future.
I can only take note of your formal and urgent request to bring up this issue and repeat that the Council will respect the judgment passed by the Court as soon as it has studied all the consequences and implications of this judgment.
I shall, however, take note of the fact that you would like the Council to bring up this matter.
I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether she can confirm my belief that European citizens are entitled to benefit from this decision, whether or not the Member States have put provisions in place to interpret the decision?
Am I correct in thinking that from the date the decision is made citizens are entitled to benefit from it?
At this stage, and because the Court handed down this judgment so recently, I do wish to stand by what I said, but I certainly understand the way you would like to interpret this judgment.
I do hope that the Council will have time to study the implications of the judgment and to identify how far it is possible to confirm, invalidate or interpret the question you have asked.
I therefore hope that the Council will be given the time it needs to examine the implications, and therefore the consequences of the judgment that the Court handed down in September.
Mr President, on a point of order.
For information, I am referring to a previous Court decision which decided that, irrespective of whether a Member State had put implementing provisions in place arising from its decisions or the decisions of the Council or the Commission, citizens are entitled to benefit from those decisions.
I am simply asking the President-in-Office of the Council if she can confirm that the outcome of this particular court decision means that citizens will benefit, whatever those benefits may be, from the date of the decision and that no Member State is entitled to seek to restrict that.
As President for the sitting, I take note of your interpretation.
It has been communicated to the Council.
I shall take note of the points that you have put forward, but I stand by the answer that I have given.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 18 and 19 will be taken together.
Question No 18 by (H-0816/01):
Subject: Sellafield and the threat of terrorist attacks The European Council, meeting on 21 September 2001 in the wake of the terrible events in the United States, declared that terrorism is a real challenge to the world and to Europe.
It has moved to block the funding of terrorist organisations as a decisive aspect of meeting this challenge.
What contingency plans has the Council considered to respond to the threat of attack by terrorists on nuclear installations in the EU, and, in particular, on the Sellafield plant, taking into account the totally unacceptable decision of the British Environment Secretary to give the go-ahead on 3 October 2001 for the opening of the MOX (mixed oxide) plant at Sellafield, formal approval of which had been delayed because of the falsification of records by BNFL?
Will it now use its good offices to urge the UK government to rescind its latest decision, will it call on the Commission to intervene in this matter, and does it accept that the only solution is the closure of the Sellafield plant?
Question No 19 by (H-0824/01):

Subject: Sellafield MOX Fuel Plant In the light of the UK government' s approval on 3 October 2001 of a new plutonium fuel facility at the Sellafield nuclear complex, will the Council state its position on this proposal, particularly with regard to the security aspects, given that there are worrying reports that such a facility will increase the global trade in plutonium, that such trade will increase the threat to global security, that transportation of 'weapons usable' material makes it vulnerable to terrorists and that the atrocity of 11 September raises the risk that Sellafield could be targeted by terrorists, with catastrophic results for the populations of the UK, Ireland and globally.
The £470m MOX Plant, built five years ago by the state-owned British Nuclear Fuels plc but not yet operational, has yet to establish that the economic benefits of such a plant outweigh the health and environmental detriments, as it is required to do under EU law.
At the extraordinary session of 21 September, the Council decided that the fight against terrorism will, now more than ever, be a strategic priority of the European Union.
It is clear from the many meetings that the various Council formations and the European Council have held and will hold on this issue under the Belgian Presidency that the Council attaches a great deal of importance to this fight.
From this point of view, we should also reiterate the European Union, in the conclusions of the General Affairs Council meetings of 8 and 9 October 2001, reaffirms its commitment to non-proliferation and disarmament.
More specifically, regarding the two questions that have been asked, the Council would like to draw attention to the fact that, overall, measures concerning the physical security of nuclear plants are an area of national competence.
Quite aside from the specific circumstances that you mention, the Euratom Treaty specified safeguards of nuclear materials used for civil use in the European Union, in other words, all the measures that enable us to verify that nuclear materials and equipment are not used for anything other than the peaceful purposes for which they are intended.
It is up to the Commission to ensure that these provisions and the ensuing Community regulations are implemented, particularly Regulation No 3227/76 concerning the application of the provisions on Euratom safeguards.
The Euratom Safeguards Office has the specific task of verifying, by deploying inspectors if necessary, that the operators of nuclear power plants respect the security control obligations enshrined in the treaty, as well as those stipulated in Regulation No 3227/76.
There are several legally binding instruments at international level, which the United Kingdom and the other Member States are party, such as the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material of 3 March 1980, several provisions of which cover, for example, the theft or other illicit means of obtaining nuclear materials, and which require other Member States that are contracting parties to cooperate and assist the party that is the victim of the crime.
More generally, the Treaty on European Union contains provisions on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters among Member States, notably in Article 29.
It is on this basis that the Council is currently examining a proposal for a Council framework decision on the fight against terrorism.
This proposal includes provisions drawing up - a list of terrorist offences in Article 3, a list of minimum sentences and penalties in Article 5, as well as provisions on extradition and prosecution in Article 11 and cooperation between Member States in Article 12.
I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her lengthy reply, much of which I have heard before.
Is the President-in-Office of the Council aware that British Nuclear Fuels is technically insolvent?
Is she aware that its liabilities for cleaning up after the closure of nuclear plants and the disposal of nuclear waste run to GBP 34 billion, while it has GBP 235 million worth of shareholders' funds on its balance sheets?
Would she also agree, under those circumstances, that there is not the slightest economic justification for the continuation of the Sellafield nuclear plant, let alone for seeking to expand its nuclear operations into the future, and that, indeed, the plant should be closed?
If the Commission would - as we have requested for years - have an independent nuclear inspectorate look into the Sellafield operation, they would have found this out some years ago.
Perhaps they can find it out now.
I would like to draw the President-in-Office of the Council's attention to the fact that she has not addressed the second part of my question relating to the fact that British Nuclear Fuels has not yet established the economic benefits of the MOX fuel plant, which it is obliged to do before it can commission it under existing EU regulations.
I would also draw her attention to the report of Parliament's STOA Committee.
This is a research committee which has commissioned an extensive report on both the Sellafield plant and Cap La Hague plants, and it has raised fairly serious concerns about the emissions to air and water from both the Cap La Hague and the Sellafield plants.
It draws attention to the inadequacy of the Commission's capacity to carry out its functions under the Euratom Treaty, and it has also drawn attention to a German study which has indicated that both the Cap La Hague and Sellafield plants have something like ten times the permitted dispersal-to-air of radioactive pollution.
I would say in response that the work, the responsibilities that you expect in terms of control or arbitration are responsibilities that have been passed on to the Commission and I am not currently in a position to give you, on behalf of the Council, any details on these.
Mr President, on a point of order. I have asked the President-in-Office of the Council if she would address the second part of my question, and she has not done so either in her first or second replies.
The President-in-Office of the Council may judge whether she has sufficiently replied to the question.
Mr President, the second point was in fact more of an observation that you made as part of your question.
However, with regard to this comment, I can only repeat that these details are more of a matter for the Commission than the Council, as far as, for example, conformity to Community legislation is concerned.
As the author is not present, Question No 20 lapses.
Question No 21 by (H-0820/01):
Subject: Dioxin rules threaten fish in the Baltic A Commission proposal on the limit values for dioxin in fish could be a death blow to the Swedish fishing industry.
According to the Swedish Fisheries Board, the proposal would probably result in a total ban on the sale of salmon and eels from the Baltic.
The sale of Baltic-caught herring and small Baltic herring for human consumption would also be at risk.
In the worst case two or three thousand fishermen could lose their jobs.
Sweden will be hardest hit as Finland and Denmark also have fishing grounds in the Atlantic.
It is important not to act in too much haste in this matter.
The Swedish view is that for the time being it would be better to provide dietary advice on how often fish may be eaten, combined with a vigorous campaign against the release of dioxins, than to set limit values.
That was regarded as satisfactory in public health terms as the quantities of toxin are extraordinarily low and fish is an important source of nutrition.
Could the Council adjust the Commission proposal to avoid the destruction of much of Sweden' s fishing industry?
The presidency of the Council is currently focusing all its efforts with a view to reaching a solution that gives a balanced compromise, which will enable us to guarantee the protection of public health, whilst avoiding creating the sort of economic disruption that you described.
The presidency is thus in close contact with the Commission and members of the Council, so that this solution can be approved by the Council by the end of November 2001, during which time the Council is due to issue an opinion given that the Commission' s proposals were submitted at the end of August 2001.
I would thank the Council of Ministers for its answer.
I think it is extremely positive that an attempt is being made to reach a compromise. I intended to ask the Council of Ministers whether the compromise is based not upon absolute limit values but upon applying dietary recommendations in connection with the consumption of fish from the Baltic.
Is it a compromise along those lines that is being considered?
I also want to emphasise that the opportunity to eat herring from the Baltic, including the variety indigenous to the Baltic, is not only an economic issue but also an important cultural issue.
Prohibiting fish from the Baltic would be rather like prohibiting mussels and pommes frites in Belgium, something I imagine would be unthinkable.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would say that this is a question of an almost cultural nature.
You may reply to it as you see fit, subject to the relevant consultations with the Council' s team.
At this stage, it is difficult for me to clarify the subject of these recommendations.
I can tell you, however, that if there were no chips in Belgium, this would, in my view, be a considerable national problem.
It would, however, be of secondary importance in relation to the question that is of concern to you, but it is difficult for me to respond to this question at the moment, as it will relate to both the nature of the recommendations which will be made and also to finding the best possible compromise from an economic or any other point of view.
As the author is not present, Question No 22 lapses.
Question No 23 by (H-0838/01):
Subject: Belgian Presidency and the Regulation on models and designs Has the Belgian Presidency succeeded in convincing the Member State whose attitude was preventing the Regulation on models and designs from being adopted?
In response to your question, the Council would like to inform you that it noted, at the 27 September meeting of the Internal Market, Consumer and Tourism Council that there are no longer any barriers in the way of adopting the proposal for a regulation on the Community designs or models.
The proposal is currently being finalised by the legal linguists and is scheduled to be formally adopted by the Council at the end of November, or at the beginning of December.
I would first of all like to congratulate the Belgian Presidency on having managed to convince the Belgian government to withdraw the linguistic objections which, according to what was said earlier, were hindering the approval of the Regulation on models and designs.
Furthermore, we are pleased that, again under the Belgian Presidency, this Regulation, which is so essential to the operation of the internal market, and also to the operation of the Office for the Harmonisation of the Internal Market in Alicante, can be approved immediately.
It is not a question and therefore, unless the President-in-Office of the Council wishes to make any comment, we can end this Question Time by stating, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, that since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 24 to 27 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
(The sitting was adjourned at 7.02 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Cross-border payments in euro
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0357/2001) by Mrs Peijs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on cross-border payments in euros [COM(2001) 439 - C5-0379/2001 - 2001/0174(COD)]
Mr President, in 1990, the Commission issued a Green Paper on payments, and that marked the beginning of talks with banks about cross-border payments, among other things.
Initially, the banks expressed objections, with good reason, and we have worked for years to accommodate those objections.
We now have an international bank account number, the IBAN, we have a bank identifier code, the BIC, the reporting requirements to the Central Bank have been lifted when amounts up to EUR 12 500 are involved, and that coincides with the permitted maximum of the money-laundering directive.
There is a format to transfer payments fully automatically.
To my disappointment, this resulted only in ever more expensive transfers.
At the end of 2000, Mr Bolkestein and myself were in this plenary when the Commissioner promised on that occasion that he would take measures if nothing had changed in the first six months of this year.
In July, the Commission and Parliament established, each following their own extensive inquiries, that nothing had changed. Quite the reverse, in fact: the situation had deteriorated.
The Commissioner kept his promise and presented his Regulation, and I realise that the banks have simply missed two opportunities.
In November 2000 and even in July of this year, there would have been enough time to set up a substantial self-regulation scheme, something which all parties would have preferred to this wrap over the knuckles.
The European Banking Association has made a manful attempt to set up a cheap payment structure, step one followed by step two, for which they also received praise by the European Central Bank in its 2000 annual report.
I would endorse this, but would at the same time express my astonishment about the fact that only a very small number of banks have joined the initiative.
Much to the delight of Parliament, the Council in Ghent expressed its approval of the Regulation, and we hope that this will impact positively on the Internal Market Council.
I will now turn my attention to the amendments.
I am unable to support Amendment No 9 on self-regulation.
As I have already stated, although we welcome the idea of self-regulation, the proposal should have been backed by all banks. It should be accompanied by monitoring, guarantees, sanctions, etc.
However, the liberal amendment creates confusion about the date of entry into force and in strict legal terms, something like that cannot be provided for in this Regulation.
The other new amendments are the result of the sound cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for this sound cooperation.
I now have high hopes for the Internal Market Council reaching agreement on 26 November, something which the Ghent Summit called for.
The changes I would propose with regard to the Commission position are as follows.
First of all, I have suggested changing the date of entry into effect from 1 January to 1 March, by which date all countries will have completed their transitional periods.
Moreover, at this rate, we will not make 1 January with the notification in the Official Journal practically speaking.
I would propose a few amendments, namely 10, 13 and 16 with regard to cheques.
I do not want cheques to fall within the principle of equal costs as referred to in Article 3, because an increasing number of banks would actually like to do away with the cross-border cheque.
Guarantees concerning cheques are very different in all countries.
The cheque does remain within the scope of the transparency section of the Regulation, which is stipulated in Article 4.
Another proposal for change concerns the obligation to communicate with the banking country by using the IBAN and BIC codes.
Some banks, such as the Postbank and Internet banks, have their own codes and should not, therefore, be forced to use the IBAN and BIC codes.
Finally, I should like to turn to Mrs Torres Marques' earlier amendment. Some Member States had difficulty coming to terms with yet another institution, and that was never our intention.
We have solved the matter with a consideration for redress procedures and an article about sanctions, something which we happen to attach great importance to.
I should like to thank Commissioner Bolkestein for his courage and for the fact that he kept his promise.
His offices were always available for consultation, and all this could well result in this Regulation ending its march through the institutions on a positive note.
Parliament is expected to provide broad support.
Mr President, we have certainly had a packed agenda today.
We have had research from Mr Caudron, we have voted on Mr Jarzembowski's report on port services and we have had shipbuilding courtesy of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, but looking up at the people in the galleries I have to say that these may all have been important issues for the economy or for society, but in many cases it will have been nothing but gobbledegook to our listeners.
This issue is different.
Last summer in Austria I, myself, unintentionally parked illegally and felt dreadfully guilty.
However, my bad conscience about this parking offence was very quickly eclipsed by concern about how much it would cost me to transfer the 200 Austrian schillings for this parking ticket from Germany to Austria.
I therefore went straight to the Austrian authorities and paid in cash because I was afraid that the bank charges might be more than the actual fine.
This is an experience familiar to many people.
What is decisive, and this is something which we should also always bear in mind in this House, is how Europe measures up when people encounter it in their everyday lives, and in many of the areas on which we are working it proves to be far from perfect.
On 1 January we will get the euro.
There is a German word, 'begreifen', which means to understand, but which incorporates a notion of grasping or touching.
The public will be able to touch the euro and that is why confidence in the euro will grow from that moment on.
However, we must also make sure that all of the appropriate arrangements are in place so that the public are able to treat payments within Europe in the same way as payments within their own countries.
That is why this regulation is incredibly important, and I very much regret the fact that the idea of it has only just occurred to the Commission.
I drafted an opinion once before, nine months ago.
At that time I was still being told by the Commission that there were steep mountain tracks between the banks, and I said that if money could be made with mountain tracks it would be.
If money can be made with motorways then it will be.
We need motorways in the banking sector too.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to thank Mrs Peijs for her persistence and consistency, which have certainly paid off here.
In 47 days the euro coins and notes will be available to everyone in the euro zone as a common currency, in my opinion, the greatest European Union project ever in terms of creating identity and fostering integration.
The euro zone will be a domestic market within the internal market.
We are all called upon to do all we can, not only in connection with cross-border payments, to bring down the barriers to the creation of this domestic financial market.
The difference in cost between national and cross-border transfers in the domestic market stands in contradiction to our objectives.
A Commission study has shown that although these charges have been steadily falling since 1993, even today, at some banks, people are still having to fork out up to EUR 24 to transfer EUR 100 to another country in the EU.
That is why this Commission proposal and the report are needed.
Nevertheless, I wish to say on behalf of my group that we would welcome a genuine system of bank self-regulation, a system which is sustainable, comprehensive and credible.
It is true that the proposals currently on the table are moving in the direction of a system of self-regulation of this kind, but we do not think that they go far enough.
That is also why this report is being tabled here.
Should a credible and sustainable system of self-regulation be forthcoming then we would be prepared to vote against the regulation at the next reading, which would allow the Commission not to implement its proposal for a regulation.
However, we are waiting on the banks.
The ball is in their court.
We must adopt this approach because none of the measures taken so far have been sufficient.
Mr President, I speak on behalf of Mrs Torres Marques, who for pressing reasons cannot be here, but I shall keep to her ideas and the meaning of her speech.
The European Parliament and especially its Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has for years been insisting on the need for banks to set up payment systems in the euro zone that would allow citizens to use the euro as if it were a national currency.
Despite the existence of fixed exchange rates between the various currencies in the euro zone, cross-border payments are processed with the same charges as domestic payments.
The citizens do not understand this: why are payments within the euro zone processed as if they were international payments?
Is there or is there not a euro payment zone?
The banks have perfected their credit and debit card and electronic purse payment systems at a national level, they have perfected their international operations, and they have forgotten about the euro area.
Well, the euro zone is for us a region with a single currency which should have monetary rules in common that are easily understood by the citizens.
It is just as well that when a recent Commission study revealed that, far from having fallen, transfer charges in the euro zone had remained high, it showed the need for the draft regulation that we are now examining.
The regulation seeks, from January 2002, to equalise the charges for cross-border credit and debit card transfers that each bank performs in its own domestic market.
The Commission proposes that the same should occur with bank transfers and cheques from January 2003 onwards.
The Party of European Socialists agrees with the rapporteur' s proposals, and therefore this draft regulation deserves our approval; we also hope that an agreement can be reached with the Council at first reading.
Implementation of the regulation must not, in any event, cause domestic charges to rise.
In fact, cross-border transfers only represent 1% of the total payments made by the banks, and they are electronic payments which entail an effective reduction in staff costs for the banking system.
Thus any use of this regulation to raise charges on domestic payments must be firmly rejected by the European institutions.
The citizens have, in fact, already condemned and rejected it.
Of the main amendments approved, we highlight the one concerning the penalties to be applied in the event of infringement of the regulation by any banking organisation, as well as an indication of the procedures to follow in other situations, so as to give some assurance to the citizens who use the euro.
I believe that, with the approval of this regulation, Parliament will be contributing to a smooth launch of the new currency for the citizens, giving the euro greater credibility and strength, and easing the indispensable cultural and economic transition.
We hope that, after the decision of the Ghent European Council, this legislation will be approved as quickly as possible.
This political decision will be good for the euro zone, but most of all it will be good for the European Union.
Mr President, sometimes in politics, we have to make a choice between something that is terrible and something that is unpleasant, and now is, in fact, one of those times.
A solution to the problem of cross-border payments is now really in sight, and that is surely something to be welcomed.
Partly thanks to the tenacity of this Parliament, an arrangement will be put in place, and I think that the name of our rapporteur will remain inextricably linked with this.
Her tenacity has largely resulted in the current proposal to do something about this problem.
Consumers and businesses must be able to rely on efficient, safe and cheap services in the field of cross-border payments in the internal market once the new currency has been introduced.
After all, this euro offers the opportunity of bringing Europe truly closer to the citizen, as was stated a moment ago, and of making Europe tangible.
That is why it must be possible to use this currency as European currency without obstructions or excessive costs.
Not one citizen will understand why the remittance of euros from one country to another involves such high costs.
The banks are responsible for this, for that is where the problem lies.
But, needless to say, it is not those banks, but we as politicians, who ultimately get the blame. After all, we have launched the euro, so we are saddled with the problem.
However, it is not just our problem, it is also the problem of the banks.
In the first place, that is why the conversion must be as smooth as possible and it is therefore a good idea to concentrate all our efforts on that event.
Banks must be able to give their full attention to the successful introduction of the euro notes and coins at the beginning of next year and after that, the euro zone can, in terms of payments, develop into one country with one market.
In my view, the new amendments tabled by our rapporteur are particularly fitting in this connection, and we will be supporting them.
What we do not like in the proposal is that it could, of course, lead to a situation in which even the internal payments, which are, or at least seem to be, now mostly free, will become more expensive for the consumer.
That too will do nothing to boost the euro' s popularity.
It is therefore important to avoid this situation.
Finally, why is it a choice between two evils?
We are not bankers and therefore do not know how bank charges should be calculated, nor do we want to know, in all honesty, for that is why we have bankers.
Self-regulation is therefore the big favourite as far as our group is concerned.
We have tabled an amendment in this connection.
Should this not be accepted, and the banks have so far not been sufficiently prepared to do something about this, then these measures will unfortunately be inevitable.
Mr President, the introduction of the euro has created great expectations with the citizens.
One of those expectations is that when they use the euro in the relevant Member States, they will pay the same price for using means of payment other than cash.
It is therefore unsatisfactory that shortly before the introduction of the euro, an adequate solution has still not been found to the problem of charges for cross-border payments.
In this matter, a large proportion of the blame must be apportioned to the banks and financial institutions.
Self-regulation in the sector appears not to be working.
That is why I have great admiration for the efforts by Commissioner Bolkestein and rapporteur Peijs, who tenaciously worked to find a solution.
There are sound arguments why banks should not charge anything at all for electronic cross-border payments.
Current technology enables these payment transactions to be carried out at low cost and the same technology can also be used for cross-border payments.
The use of different charges is not desirable and contravenes the concept of an internal payment market and a common currency.
For banks, electronic payment means a saving since less labour-intensive PIN payments are encouraged.
I therefore support the view of the European Commission and rapporteur Peijs, and hope that a prompt introduction of this measure will strengthen consumer confidence.
Mr President, on 26 October 2000, I explained to Parliament why the current level of bank charges on cross-border payments in Europe are due to technical obstacles which will disappear in time, or so we hope, but which are currently unavoidable.
Under these circumstances, the reason why some Members are portraying them as evil is because they are inexorably seeking to achieve a uniform internal market and because there has been a backlash from the pro-euro propaganda, which promised the impossible.
Having made these points, I shall leave it there.
The proposal for a regulation that is before us today belongs to the next stage.
Since the market is putting up some resistance, it is proposed that we use force to make it submit, by decreeing compulsory equality of bank charges on internal transactions, as on cross-border transactions.
We believe this text is untimely, not only because it denies the realities of the market, which will exact their revenge in one way or another in the future, but for four other reasons.
The first is that it undermines subsidiarity, because this issue should be a matter for Member States.
The second is that it undermines the freedom of pricing, which we actually believed was carefully safeguarded by the Commission. For the euro, however, which of our grand principles would we not allow to be sacrificed?
The third is that it undermines the commitments repeatedly made to use regulation as sparingly as possible because, in being directly applied to the Member States, such regulation undermines the national parliaments' power of transposition, which is, in fact, perfectly legitimate.
The fourth and final reason is that this will lead to many rather veiled forms of unequal treatment of citizens, since the actual, but banned, costs of cross-border payments will have to be passed on to other banking products.
There, then, are many more reasons than are needed for rejecting this regulation.
Mr President, Parliament has for years demanded that the Commission take action so that consumers' bank charges in the euro area can be reduced.
The current situation, in which for a payment of EUR 100 you may have to pay as much as EUR 23 bank handling charges, cannot be tolerated.
Other colleagues, too, have referred to this matter.
Besides, at the beginning of next year the problem will only get bigger, when twelve euro area Member States move over to euro cash.
Developing the payment system and reducing the costs incurred both by banks and subsequently by consumers is therefore one of the top-priority items on the 'urgent' list of our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I am sure that the Commission will agree with this target we have, but the means to achieve it differ in part from Parliament' s original wishes.
Structural problems must not be solved by force.
Cross-border bank charges can permanently be reduced only, and indeed only, if we are able to create technical standards for automated handling of payments in the euro area.
The current high costs are caused by the fact that payments have to be processed manually.
This paper chase, as old as Adam, is costing both time and money.
However, since there is not sufficient consensus in the banking sector so that this kind of technical standard could have been produced, Parliament has in several reports on the matter emphasised the role of the European Central Bank in the development of a payment system.
In fact, Parliament did, towards the end of last year, demand that the ECP should assemble a working group of qualified experts in the field, who would be given the task to create a suitable standard.
The idea of Parliament was that the group would have carried out the work during this year and a proposal would have been made public before Christmas.
In this way, a new standard, binding upon all banks, would factually have existed before the euro zero hour at the turn of the year, after which the commercial banks could have implemented it at their required time schedules.
This kind of arrangement would naturally have also given a competitive edge to those financial institutions, which are able to make a transfer to the new system faster than others.
It is regrettable that this was not achieved.
Therefore, this time it is unavoidable that we have to read the Commission report, which in all respects truly is not in accordance with Parliament' s original wishes.
Mr President, I think that the Commission proposal has, in fact, come just at the right time, better late than never, and makes it clear that the currency union is not only being completed in the interests of the markets and business, but also in the interests of consumers.
I should like to recall that we have been working on this issue for over 10 years, as the rapporteur rightly said, and that we have always supported self-regulation and voluntary agreements, but that in this sector it has, in the end, always been necessary to adopt legislation, in order for example to bring about quicker, more reliable and above all cheaper transfers.
Here I am, of course, also thinking of the double charges which both those who made transfers and those who received them had to pay.
Happily, this is now in the past, but this experience in the European Parliament taught us precisely that it is necessary to enact legislation.
That is why I welcome both the tone and form of the regulation.
It does not dictate prices, but it does state quite clearly that domestic and cross-border credit transfers must be treated on the same footing because we are in an internal market.
This internal market requires a European payment system, and not just for large payments, like TARGET, but also for retail payments, for the transfer of small amounts.
Everyone is affected by this: mothers or fathers who have children studying or undergoing training abroad; those of us who order books or wish to pay for a journey or a hotel in another European country.
Those who have a holiday flat or even a holiday home are affected by this.
All of them suffer as a result of this situation, including migrant workers who receive their wages in one country and want to send them home to their families.
We need to think of them.
An average of EUR 24 to transfer EUR 100 is quite simply too much and unacceptable.
I strongly reject Mr Maaten's proposal.
We have tried everything; now we need to make decisions.
I must also say that I do not understand Mr Karas's plea.
Why should a proposal be forthcoming now, in the next two or three weeks, when it has been overdue for over 15 years?
I have to say also that the proposals to postpone all of this to 2005 are really unacceptable in my view.
The rapporteur's argument is as far as I am prepared to go, and I therefore think that we need to secure a broad majority in favour of this long-awaited project here in Parliament, because a European payment system would have been a reality long ago if the banks and building societies had wanted it.
Mr President, it is clear that the banks have been toying with this issue for years and have, at long last, thrown away this opportunity, making it necessary to introduce binding rules in a regulation.
It is not on for EUR 18 of bank charges to be debited for transfers of, say, EUR 100, and often this is done twice, once from the sender's account and once from the recipient's.
It is not on quite simply because the financial institutions have, for some considerable time, had the technical means to carry out transfers, honour cheques and make card payments quickly and at a reasonable cost.
We must be careful to ensure, however, and this has already been mentioned several times - that, as cross-border charges go down, domestic charges are not increased correspondingly.
Should this be the case then, in the future, domestic charges will also have to be laid down in a regulation.
We should clarify this too.
One snag is the fact that there are moves to postpone the deadline by two months.
On this point, I am afraid that I cannot go along with the rapporteur.
The banks have always been able to raise interest rates and bank charges overnight.
In the space of a month and a half it will now also be possible for them to lower their charges to a standard level.
I hope that there is not a majority in favour of the amendments concerned.
Mr President, I thank the Commission for the brave proposal for a Regulation and congratulate Mrs Peijs for her long-term commitment to this matter, without which we probably would have been unable to convince the Commission and the Council of the need for this legislative initiative.
In fact, I also support all amendments which Mrs Peijs has tabled on behalf of our group.
Despite this, it is regrettable that some three years following the launch of the electronic euro and on the eve of 1 January 2002, we are still having to work on a piece of legislation of this kind.
It is beyond me why the banks, which otherwise find each other so promptly and efficiently in a cross-border context and are united in effective professional organisations, should be forced by law to organise themselves properly and to automate in order to be able to work more cost-effectively in the internal market, and no longer to discriminate.
The binding nature of the non-discrimination rule will raise a few eyebrows, but there is no alternative: leaving things as they are would be worse, for we would then accept what some small businesses and consumers fear, namely that the benefits of the euro will pass them by and that cross-border payments will continue to cost some EUR 20 each.
As we cannot afford to lose the confidence of the consumers or of small businesses, we have no choice.
There is one concern I have, and I should like to ask the Commissioner a question in that connection.
How can we prevent this Regulation from being seized by the banks as an excuse to increase the charges for domestic payments, and how does the Commission itself view this proposal?
Is it being regarded as a big stick in order to get a last-minute gentlemen' s agreement out of the banks or, Commissioner, do you intend to continue to move towards a Regulation?
I hope that you as Commissioner remain resolute.
Mr President, as Mrs Peijs stated a moment ago, I was standing on the same spot in this House in October last year, talking about the same issue, namely the establishment of a common payment area.
The Commission had just published its fourth or fifth communication on that subject and in it, it was stipulated that the internal market and the single currency had to be accompanied by a common payment area.
This Parliament then levelled criticism at the Commission for being too passive.
I remember this well.
Mrs Peijs wondered when the Commission would spring into action.
Well, the Commission has listened carefully to Mrs Peijs and has acted accordingly, no one will be able to deny this now.
The Commission has submitted a draft Regulation which is based on a simple principle, namely that each payment in euro is to cost the same, irrespective of whether the payment is national or cross-border.
This is of the utmost importance to the citizens, as has been noted by many Members of this Parliament.
Today, the euro is a virtual currency, especially for the citizens, but on 1 January 2002, the currency will become tangible, for from that date onwards, 300 million Europeans will be using the same bank notes and coins.
Today, European citizens still accept that a cross-border payment costs more than a national one.
The reason is that different currencies are involved, but after 1 January, that will no longer be the case.
The citizens will then question the usefulness of the euro if cross-border payments are still as expensive as they are now.
In this connection, I should like to remind you that our latest study into the cost of cross-border payments has yielded baffling results.
It transpired that in the year 2001, a cross-border payment of EUR 100 costs no less than EUR 24 on average.
We carried out a similar study in 1993 and unfortunately, we had to establish that no progress at all had been made in eight years.
That is why the Commission has decided to introduce a Regulation as a tool.
The market itself has failed to come up with solutions to the posed problem, and with this interventionist measure, the legislator wants to force the economic operators to set up the infrastructure which the market requires.
As Mrs Peijs knows, I am a staunch Liberal, and I regret the fact that I had no choice but to propose such a binding document for the banks.
However, it is the only way to persuade the economic operators to take great pains over the new systems which are vital for the smooth running of the internal market.
It is therefore with satisfaction that I have noted that the first results are rolling in.
In one section of the bank sector, the plan is now being put forward to set up a new system for cross-border payments.
And that proves that the present proposal for a Regulation is also realistic.
After all, the saying 'where there is a will, there is a way' also applies to the bank sector.
What took me rather by surprise is the idea of the bank sector that since they, as banks, have committed to implementing the plan, we, as Commission, can withdraw our proposal for a Regulation.
Firstly, we should not overlook the fact that this plan can only count on a proportion of the bank sector.
Indeed, there are three European pressure groups for banking and only one of those has written to me to propose this plan.
That is an important fact.
After all, a payment system is a network, and a network develops at the rate of the slowest members that belong to it.
All it takes is for a few members of a network to refuse to develop any further, and that will throw a spanner in the works for the other members.
That is, in fact, one of the reasons why in the past ten years, no progress has been made whatsoever.
Secondly, the proposed plan is too late.
It was only announced in a press release two weeks prior to the discussion of the proposal in Parliament.
However, the Commission has been asking for this matter to be looked into for the past eleven years, but in all that time, too little progress has been made, and for those reasons, the Commission is unable to give a positive response to those MEPs who proposed to grant the bank sector a certain level of self-regulating authority.
The bank sector has had sufficient time, and it, at least a section of it, is now coming up with a proposal.
It is too little, too late, and that is why the Commission must resort to the proposals of a Regulation.
It is therefore illogical to demand withdrawal of the proposal just before the first benefits are becoming visible.
Accordingly, the idea to suspend the Regulation, as proposed in Amendment No 9 by Mr Maaten, seems unacceptable to me.
I repeat what I have said a moment ago: the proposals for self-regulation are too late.
Any call from the Commission to the banking world is being, or has been, backed by this Parliament, which is encouraging.
In this connection, I would praise many MEPs and particularly the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, who has worked tenaciously to achieve the goal, namely to reduce the cost of transfers.
In this respect, Mrs Peijs is the mouthpiece of the citizens and illustrates the great significance for industry, not least the small- and medium-size enterprises.
The Commission proposal specifically embodies what is referred to as the Europe of the citizens.
I should like to turn to yet another bone of contention, namely the date on which the present draft Regulation should enter into force.
Some MEPs have in this connection referred to the opinion of the European Central Bank which states that the ECB is in complete agreement with the objectives which we aim to achieve with our proposal, but that we, the Commission, are said to go too fast and are too demanding.
The bottom line in the ECB' s argument is that the banks need more time to set up the necessary infrastructure and logistical provisions.
That is why the European Central Bank proposes 1 January 2005 for the Regulation to come into force.
On the one hand, I do not dispute the fact that time will be needed to set up this infrastructure, but on the other hand, we should not make a mountain out of a molehill.
After all, for years, banks have claimed that cross-border payments only account for 1% of the total transfers.
Consequently, the entry into force of the Regulation in 2003 will not involve insurmountable additional costs, and if our expectations are fulfilled and if it transpires that the price reduction results in a greater use of this means of payment, then there will be even more reason to go full steam ahead with the activities.
The report by Mrs Peijs contains sixteen amendments, seven pertaining to the recitals and nine to the articles.
One single amendment is not acceptable, namely Amendment No 9 on the suspension of the Regulation which I mentioned a moment ago.
One amendment constitutes a legal problem, namely Amendment No 4 on the rise in costs for domestic payments.
It concerns a political statement which although I fully endorse it, does not fit in a legal document.
Moreover, in this connection, I should like to refer to the last speaker, Mrs Thijssen, who asked me whether it is possible for banks to compensate for the losses incurred with regard to international payments by national payments.
As has been rightly noted, this proposed Regulation is not a price measure: indeed, the charges for transfers are not specified, and that means that, in theory, the charges for national payments could increase.
However, an essential component of this Regulation is transparency.
Banks must notify their customers of the price structure for the different types of transfers and they must also inform their customers when those prices change.
That means that total transparency will apply in terms of what this is all going to cost, and the Commission assumes that, based on the normal rules of competition, the different costs for domestic payments will be kept under control and will therefore not increase.
Amendment No 6 stipulates that the Member States must assume their responsibilities with regard to the application of this Regulation.
The Commission can identify with the first part of the amendment.
The second part, however, comes across as somewhat mysterious, and the Commission is finding it difficult to pass judgment on it at this stage.
With Amendment No 10, the person who tabled this amendment hopes that the principle of non-discrimination will not apply to payment cheques.
As it happens, the Commission has never wanted to promote the use of cheques and therefore agrees with the amendment.
In addition, rapporteur Peijs would like the entry into force of the Regulation to be postponed until 1 March 2002.
That does not pose any problems for the Commission.
We can thus accept that amendment.
The other seven amendments are acceptable in principle, although some will need to be edited.
This proposal will be discussed by the Internal Market Council in some ten days' time, on 26 November.
I am convinced that we will reach an agreement, not least because the European Council in Ghent has requested the Council to reach its findings promptly and has endorsed this proposal.
I know that the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, also has numerous contacts with the Council and I think she will share my feelings on this score.
I should like to thank Mrs Peijs for the excellent document she has drafted and for all her efforts since 1989 to reduce the costs of cross-border payments.
I hope that second reading will be nothing but a formality, in which case the text will be ready for publication in January.
Finally, I should like to ask Mrs Thyssen a second question.
She has also asked me whether the Commission is prepared to stand by its decision, and not to succumb to the pressure of the banks, and whether she considers this as a big stick.
No, Mr President, this is intended as a Regulation and the Commission is thus certainly planning to adhere to its original brief and to ensure that this Regulation enters into force in March next year and that cross-border payments will cost no more than national transfers.
Finally, allow me to thank Parliament as a whole for the sound cooperation.
It shows how progress can be made if both institutions, Parliament and the Commission, are on the same wavelength.
This proposal demonstrates the specific benefits of Europe to the citizen and enhances confidence in the European Union.
Mr President, I would not want Mr Bolkestein to return home thinking that there are extremely mysterious goings-on in this Parliament.
The first part of the amendment which the Commissioner mentioned remains unchanged, something which he, in fact, endorsed.
We, too, thought that the second part was set out in a rather peculiar way, all the more so since it was not Parliament' s intention to set up a new institute.
We have converted this part into a recital, which contains more or less the same question for redress procedures as the 1997 directive.
With this, I believe that all mysterious elements have been removed, and we will thus all be able to concentrate on the second reading.
Mr President, the Commission has taken note of what Mrs Peijs said a moment ago and will specify its position in due course.
Many thanks, Mr President.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0352/2001) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 92/79/EEC, Directive 92/80/EEC and Directive 95/59/EC as regards the structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco [COM(2001) 133 - C5-0139/2001 - 2001/0063(CNS)]
, rapporteur. (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am really sorry but, as far as this draft directive is concerned, I am unable to help reconcile the two institutional bodies.
I am sorry, but I must recommend that the Commission proposal be rejected.
As you know, cigarettes are not a tax-free commodity.
They are already subject to excise and value added tax and in Europe these taxes are extremely high, accounting for 70% to 80% of their price.
The Commission has proposed a fixed minimum tax of EUR 70, in addition to the system of proportional taxation which already applies.
The argument is that, instead of converging, taxation diverges from one country to another in the Union.
That is the first mistake.
It is not true that there are tax divergences; there is no particular convergence, but that is not the same as divergence.
There is greater convergence on cigarettes than there is with numerous other items, as confirmed in the independent study by the Directorate-General of Research of the European Parliament, which naturally was not written solely to back me up.
Why does the Commission feel that taxes should converge?
Because they are one reason why prices differ, which is one reason why smuggling and tax fraud are on the rise.
Of course, these need to be stamped out and Parliament has repeatedly proposed measures which, unfortunately, have not been taken up, in order to stamp out cigarette smuggling.
But if price differences are to be wiped out, the difference in price itself needs to be wiped out.
The Commission has admitted that we do not know if tax convergence will bring about price convergence.
It is certain there will be no convergence because the industry is a monopoly industry and can therefore engage in strategic price setting.
These prices are not the result of market forces, they are competitive weapons used by the monopolies and we are living in cloud cuckoo land if we expect them to level out.
Similarly, the Commission proposal makes no provision whatsoever to harmonise value added tax, which fluctuates from one Member State to another by as much as 100%.
How can taxation be harmonised unless value added tax on cigarettes is harmonised at the same time?

Indeed smuggling - if it is smuggling to buy cheap cigarettes in one country of the Union in which the tax on them has been paid and sell them in another country in the Union in which they are more expensive, which in my view it is not, it is the normal working of the single market, but insofar as it is smuggling or if the tax is not paid, as in the case of England, where the situation will not change and which has a serious cigarette smuggling problem, with 50% of cigarettes smoked in England smuggled in, precisely because the tax costs as much as the price of the cigarettes, the situation will not be affected in England because the Commission proposal will not affect prices in Belgium, Holland or France, which is where the smuggled cigarettes come from.
On the contrary, prices will rise in the Member States in the south, especially, of course, if we accept the candidate countries into the European Union; or rather when we accept them, which I hope we shall, prices will rise there as a result of this directive by up to 200% to 400%.
Just imagine if there are derogations to cover this sort of price increase and just imagine what will happen with smuggling from the Ukraine or Russia or from China or India if we allow this sort of price increase.
The public health argument, that is, that higher prices reduce smoking, has also been wheeled out.
How do we know it will?
Because we have statistics.
But the statistics are based on legal cigarettes.
The increase in the price of cigarettes does indeed reduce legal smoking, but it encourages illegal smoking and in England the mafia is having a field day and has put the cigarette market completely out of kilter for precisely this reason.
Furthermore, Commissioner, I must say that the Council has not demonstrated the necessary respect or tact vis-à-vis Parliament, because a week before we submitted our opinion, it presented us with a political agreement in which it attempts to force our opinion.
I hardly think that is the way to run democratic institutions but if, nonetheless, that is how Parliament is to be run, then one wonders why we won the Cold War.
And I heard you say in your previous speech that you are a dyed-in-the-wool liberal.
This makes we wonder how you can come along and support a measure from which, in the economic sector, only large monopolies stand to gain for reasons which, unfortunately, I cannot go into now, but you know full well that I am right, while, in the political sector, you come along with something which looks to me very much like totalitarianism.
I think that this sort of difference between the theory which we espouse and the practice which we follow should give you food for thought.
Mr President, the rapporteur is proposing rejection of the Commission's proposal.
We, in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, are rather reluctant to do this without telling the Commission why, at least without giving the Commission a written explanation.
However, in conclusion it has to be said that the directive cannot remain as it is.
In its opinion, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also made a number of comments.
It confined its comments to its particular field.
The issue of health protection undoubtedly has a role to play in this proposal for a directive.
However, this is not an issue for our committee.
The question of whether the minimum excise duty should be EUR 140, 120, 100, 80 or 60 is also undoubtedly significant in connection with health protection, but not for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
For us, it was exclusively legal considerations that mattered.
In this respect, the directive would appear to have two essential weaknesses, which mean that it does not stand up to scrutiny against reasonable internal market considerations.
Firstly, the system of having a minimum incidence of excise duty comes under pressure from the fact that value added tax is imposed on top of this minimum rate.
If I take a country where the rate of excise duty is the bare minimum required and the rate of value added tax is also very low, then I have to conclude that there are distortions of competition if I compare it with a country where the rate of excise duty perhaps exceeds the minimum and there is a relatively high rate of value added tax.
That is why we think that in the future, instead of requiring a minimum incidence of excise duty exclusive of value added tax, it would be appropriate to work on the basis of a system which provides for a minimum rate of excise duty inclusive of the applicable value added tax.
The second point concerns Article 3(1). We think that this proposal no longer draws a proper distinction between cigarettes and cigarillos or cigars.
The proposal tries to give the impression that cigarillos with filters are cigarettes with dark-coloured wrappers and that they should be taxed accordingly, like cigarettes.
We believe that this is wrong.
The health effects of filters can certainly be disputed, but it ought to be indisputable that a cigarillo with a filter is in any case slightly more healthy than a cigarillo without a filter.
If, however, I treat cigarillos with filters as equivalent to cigarettes for tax purposes - and I am not a cigarillo smoker! - then I penalise the fundamentally healthier product by taxing it like a cigarette.
That is why I think that improvements also need to be made here.
We agree with the conclusion that the proposal should be rejected.
Even if it sounds harsh, technical improvements are necessary.
.
(NL) Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I would thank the Commission for the proposal on upward convergence of excise on tobacco.
Parliament requested this a few years ago and the Commission is now meeting this request.
In our view, the proposal is an improvement on the current situation and also solves a number of problems, including that of continuing to allow for exceptions, as is the case for Sweden now and the accession countries in future.
For that reason, we believe it is a considered proposal.
We did, however, table a number of amendments.
Firstly, there is the issue of VAT which Messrs Katiforis and Wieland also mentioned.
I share their point of view on this score, and that is why my group has re-tabled the amendment that was already adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, namely to include VAT in the equation.
Secondly, our committee was of the opinion that the issue should be clearly placed in the context of existing negotiations in the World Trade Organisation, for the latter plays a major role in this.
Thirdly, we believe that a great deal must be done against smuggling.
I do not subscribe to the rapporteur' s point of view that an increase in excise will, in itself, promote smuggling or, vice versa, that a reduction in excise will lead to a drop in the incidence of smuggling.
I am of the opinion that completely different measures should be taken against smuggling, which are, in fact, the topic of debate in the World Trade Organisation.
Furthermore, we have tabled an amendment on tobacco subsidies, a much-debated topic which is also relevant in this context.
We have also tabled an amendment in which we state that, concerning products which are less unhealthy, we should be working towards a system, maybe not now, but in 2005, whereby the excise on those products would also be lower.
We therefore support the gist of the Commission proposal, as well as the position which the Council has already adopted in this respect.
Mr President, this is one of the few occasions on which I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Katiforis, not because we talk the same language or are from the same country, but because we agree on what is called common sense.
I am sorry, but common sense is nowhere to be seen in this proposal for a directive, which we, too, propose should be rejected in its entirety.
If it is not rejected, we are all in danger of exposing ourselves because, if this sort of directive is adopted, it will have exactly the opposite of, what the Council says, are the desired results.
I should also like to point out that it would be most useful if the Council were present rather than absent, like their common sense.
The Council says that the aim is to combat tax evasion and cigarette smuggling.
If we increase tax, then we shall increase tax evasion.
We all know that, the higher the tax, the more attractive tax evasion becomes.
If we increase the price of cigarettes, as is proposed, then we shall, without question, increase cigarette smuggling because we shall be making legal cigarettes more expensive than smuggled cigarettes.
So we shall be working counter to our aims.
Again, the Council tells us that one of its aims is to protect public health and that this aim will be achieved by people giving up smoking because cigarettes are more expensive.
And who can say that people stop smoking when cigarettes go up in price?
The best case scenario is that there will be no change in the consumption of cigarettes.
The worst case scenario is that smokers on low incomes will change to cheaper, that is, more harmful cigarettes.
Is that what we want to achieve?
How clever of us!
Similarly, the proposals in the proposed directive are wrong because, first of all, they restrict application to five, mainly southern countries.
The other ten are not affected because they are already at the topmost point.
Secondly, the cost of living will rise in these five countries, four of which are southern countries, without any increase in wages, thereby exacerbating inflationary pressures.
I also think we should ask ourselves what the candidate countries have to say about this proposal for a directive?
Do they think it shows the European Union's concern for them?
And it would be helpful to know how their governments are going to persuade them that integration into the European Union will benefit consumers, when they will have to pay 200 to 500% more for cigarettes under this sort of directive.
Finally, I should like to express my disappointment with Ecofin for its rushed attempt to pre-empt tomorrow's vote here by issuing details of its compromise agreement.
That was a mistake on their part.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for this proposal.
The rapporteur gives me no option but to disagree with him.
Only yesterday in this House we passed a resolution giving the European Parliament's opinion on the third round of negotiations for the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.
This House should never forget that tobacco is the biggest cause of preventable illness and disease across the European Union.
It is like no other product.
Each year half a million EU citizens die needlessly due to tobacco.
In Scotland, which I represent, 13,000 people died last year due to smoking.
The Commission proposal will help people to stop smoking.
This proposal will introduce a cash minimum amount of cigarette duty.
Currently the rule is expressed as a percentage of tax, inclusive of the retail selling price, and therefore has little effect on Member States and applicant countries where retail prices are already low.
The more expensive a packet of cigarettes, the bigger the incentive to stop smoking.
Some say that the most effective way to help smokers cure their addiction is to make cost the issue.
Therefore any measures to reduce smoking are more than welcome and are more important to my mind than any arguments which support the tobacco industry.
As regards smuggling, unlike the rapporteur I believe this proposal will prevent smuggling within the EU.
Minimum EU rates of duty are sensible and effective in tackling the scourge of smuggling.
The Commission's proposal is a good proposal and therefore should be wholeheartedly supported.
Mr President, it strikes me that the Katiforis report does not explain why the European Commission proposal to change excise duty rates for tobacco is being rejected.
It appears impossible to underpin this position.
As this new proposal introduces changes to existing directives, the legal base is not at issue.
One of the reasons for change is the fact that the Member States miss out on a huge amount of excise on account of fraud and smuggling. The internal market, therefore, still leaves something to be desired, and there is also competitive distortion.
If the discrepancies between the Member States become less pronounced, fraud and smuggling will be discouraged and will, hopefully, even vanish altogether.
Furthermore, the necessary increase in tobacco excise for a number of Member States, following on from this proposal, will not cause any damage to health.
For the reasons already stated, I welcome a minimum excise duty of 57%.
Where smuggling practices persist and even involve tobacco manufacturers, the European Commission will need to take additional measures.
I have already called for the dismantling of tobacco subsidies several times.
The amendments by Mr Maaten therefore receive my unqualified support.
The European Union is still very much lacking credibility on this score.
On the one hand, tobacco consumption is discouraged by warning labels, bans on tobacco advertising and higher excise, while on the other hand EUR 1 billion goes up in smoke in the form of tobacco subsidies.
Supporting tobacco growers in the switch to another crop which also entails subsidies, is a very generous solution and therefore deserves Parliament' s support.
I call on the Council to support the European Commission proposals and to stand up to the pressure exerted by one or two Member States.
Moreover, I object to Mr Folias' appropriation of common sense.
I could claim with just as much justification that everyone is entitled to their own stupidity.
Mr President, the position taken by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal under discussion has surprised me.
It diverges considerably from the position taken by this Parliament in 1996.
At that time, Parliament urged the Commission to make proposals for upward harmonisation of tobacco prices, based upon higher duty rates across the Union for reasons including health protection, and to consider measures to reduce the scope for price manipulation by cigarette producers applying widely diverging pre-tax on the markets of each Member State.
The present Commission proposal is consistent with that opinion.
That is why I say that the advice of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee has greatly surprised me.
The Commission is doing what Parliament wanted in 1996 and therefore it is odd that the report should not accept the Commission's proposal.
The changes proposed will bring about increased convergence in duty rates within the European Union and, as such, improve the functioning of the internal market, both now and as it will be after enlargement.
They will also reduce the incentive for excise fraud within the Union.
More surprisingly - and Mr Blokland has just drawn attention to this - the draft report does not set out the reasons for rejecting the Commission proposal.
That is the least that the Commission would have expected.
According to the working document presented by the rapporteur to EMAC in June, the main justification is that the introduction of a minimum amount of taxation of EUR 70 for cigarettes constitutes a shift towards specific taxation, and would disadvantage small- and medium-sized producers in southern Member States.
I would like to emphasise that this is emphatically not the view of the Commission.
The introduction of a fixed amount in euro does not alter the structure of excise duties on cigarettes.
Member States affected by the introduction of the fixed amount will retain the flexibility they enjoy at present to determine the proportions of the specific and ad valorem components of cigarette taxation, as other rules remain unchanged.
I would also like to point out that the Commission proposal has received broad support in the Council.
Last week in the Ecofin Council the Member States unanimously agreed a compromise text produced by the Belgian Presidency, which is clearly in line with the Commission's proposal.
For cigarette taxation, the most significant element is the introduction of a minimum amount of duty of EUR 60 at the initial stage and EUR 64 at a later stage, rather than the EUR 70 proposed by the Commission.
The adoption of the proposal is also extremely important in view of the forthcoming enlargement of the Union eastwards.
Mr Folias has quite rightly drawn our attention to that aspect of the proposal.
The existing minimum taxation requirement - the so-called 57% rule - allows for a higher degree of price manipulation and would not in itself be sufficient to reduce to a sustainable level the gap between the tax and price levels of the present Member States and the candidate countries.
Such a situation would result in substantial revenue loss for present Member States, especially those having borders with candidate countries.
The requirement for a minimum amount of duty will avoid this happening and ensure the proper functioning of the internal market after enlargement.
The Commission is aware that achieving the amounts in euro will require a significant effort from most candidate countries.
Therefore, it has proposed that the Council grant limited transitional periods to candidate countries for reaching the minimum rate of taxation.
Next, I was pleased to see that the two Parliament committees that have issued opinions on the proposal - the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, with Mr Maaten as draftsman, and the Committee for Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, with Mr Wieland as draftsman - accepted the general thrust of the proposal, subject to a number of amendments.
Most of the amendments proposed in Mr Maaten's report have been re-tabled in this plenary.
The Commission broadly shares the concerns of Mr Maaten on the need to pay more attention to health policy and to combat fraud and smuggling.
I do not see why Mr Katiforis cannot accept the arguments relating to health.
It is a well known fact - and I am sure he is aware of it - that 75% of smokers started before the age of 18.
Report after report and study after study confirm that for young people under the age of 18, price clearly is a determining factor in terms of smoking.
I was pleased to hear both Mrs Stihler and Mr Blokland support the view of the Commission that there is a direct link between price and quantity consumed and that therefore the price very definitely has a bearing on health.
Mr Folias said that if the price goes up then cheaper cigarettes will be purchased and smoked.
According to that reasoning, if the price went down then more expensive cigarettes would also be purchased.
That is something that, in reality, is not noticeable.
Therefore, with all due respect to Mr Folias, his reasoning is not in line with reality.
While I am answering specific questions by Parliament, I have to say that I do not understand the argument by Mr Wieland - referring to the legal aspects of the case - when he says that the interplay of VAT and excise taxes would be illegal.
Of course they have a bearing on competition and smuggling, as we all know, but why should this be illegal, as he maintains?
The point of view of his committee is based on the legal state of affairs.
He says that there is a problem in that cigarillos of a certain dimension and character should be treated as cigars and not as cigarettes.
Well, I have some here.
If you showed an average citizen of the European Union this packet of cigarillos, took one of them out - of the same dimensions and weight as an ordinary cigarette - and asked them if it was more like a cigarette or more like a cigar, I would wager Mr Wieland 144 packets of cigarettes or cigarillos - whichever he prefers - that the average citizen of the European Union would classify them as cigarettes.
Most of the amendments proposed in Mr Maaten's opinion have been retabled for this plenary.
The Commission broadly shares these concerns on the need to pay more attention to health policy.
But the amendments require no change to the proposal.
According to the existing review requirements, the Commission already has the obligation to take into account the wider Treaty objectives, including health.
New developments, resulting for instance from the conclusion of a WHO framework convention on tobacco control, will thus automatically have to be taken into consideration in a subsequent review.
The Commission and the Member States have also taken a number of initiatives to combat fraud and smuggling following the conclusions of the high-level group on fraud in the field of excise duties.
To conclude, for the reasons I have given, the Commission is still convinced of the merits of its proposal and still considers the proposals by the Commission to be a direct reply to Parliament's own opinion expressed in 1996.
Therefore the Commission invites all Members of Parliament who have expressed an opinion contrary to that of the Commission to reconsider their position on this issue very carefully before tomorrow's vote.
Mr President, Commissioner, you have just shown us an example.
May I ask you whether the Commission is of the view that tobacco products, like Commissioners, should be assessed not on their packaging but on their content?
Mr President, the Commission always looks at content, rather than form.
But the form in this respect is important.
If you ask the ordinary citizen of the European Union, "What is this?
Is this more like a cigarette or more like a cigar?" Because it is exactly the same size as a cigarette, has the same width and the same weight limits, he will say, without a shadow of a doubt, "This is like a cigarette" and not "This is like a cigar".
That is the Commission's opinion too.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
European Council in spring 2002
The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0528/01) by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission's synthesis report in preparation for the Spring 2002 European Council.
Mr President, in March 2000, the Lisbon European Council set out a new strategy for the coming decade.
At that time we were working on the basis of very optimistic economic data and really thought that we could bring about sustainable growth of at least 3%, along with economic reform, full employment and also social inclusion.
Today our starting point is more difficult because the global economy has gone in the opposite direction and even the European Union, despite its readiness to reform and the reforms which it has already implemented, is experiencing an economic downturn.
That is why the following question is now much more urgent than it was during the preparations for the first spring summit in Stockholm: how does the Commission intend to continue this ambitious process of making the European Union, on the basis of innovation and knowledge, the most dynamic and competitive economic area in the world, and enabling it to overcome the problems which I have described?
This question is all the more pertinent for the spring summit in Barcelona because, after evaluating a strategy of this kind for two years, it ought to be possible to identify the areas where national and European policy have actually been guided by the quantitative and qualitative objectives and see to what extent it has been possible to bundle measures together and make them visible.
The Member States' budgets have actually shown uniform increases across the board in investment in research and development, innovation and further development of the information and communication society.
The few figures which are available to us in the European Parliament unfortunately do not yet speak the specific language which we would have liked, because we had hoped that the Lisbon strategy and its consistent implementation would also have yielded visible added value as a result of economic, financial, employment and social policy being coordinated at European level, so as to demonstrate to the public the benefits which European policy can have for them and quite specifically how it can improve their quality of life and work.
We should certainly also ask what approach has been adopted to achieve the ambitious aim of increasing investment in the European Union.
How has cross-border investment in infrastructure actually been made visible apart from through reports?
The European Parliament needs to ask all of these questions because, in drafting its synthesis report, the Commission has the duty of actually producing a blueprint for the further consultations at the spring summit, which will then, of course, in the end, form the broad guidelines of the future economic policy of the European Union and its Member States.
In the current economic downturn and at a time when we are also facing particular challenges because of the adverse economic consequences of the terrible terrorist acts of 11 September - and in considering these issues we have to take into account a new aspect, the collapse of consumer confidence - we must also ask ourselves the following question: what can we do to stop a self-fulfilling prophecy, which states that we are sliding into recession, from becoming a reality?
The Commission therefore bears great responsibility for taking more of a lead on setting targets and taking more practical action to reform the economy, not only with respect to the labour market, but also with respect to the other markets, full employment and also social inclusion, by issuing specific guidance on these areas.
Of course this also raises the question, and I should also like to address this particularly to you, Commissioner, of whether the tax situation, where unfortunately we still have countries pursuing independent national policies rather than coordinated ones, does not have an adverse impact on investment in the European Union and, in particular, on cross-border investment.
Commissioner, the European Parliament is still not clear about how it is actually, finally to be involved in this whole process, which is now approaching its second spring summit.
So far we have not been involved as partners in the macro-economic dialogue.
There are no plans to organise another forum with all of the stakeholders, as was done before the Lisbon meeting.
It really is legitimate to ask whether the European Parliament's involvement is adequate and whether it is therefore able to represent the interests of the people in this process of setting priorities for the European Union's economic and structural policy.
We really are in a situation where we need to mobilise our forces and rally optimism.
How do you envisage doing this in your synthesis report?
What working methods do you intend to choose and which guidelines do you intend to issue in it?
Mr President, in reply to the questions from Mrs Randzio-Plath, I should like to say first of all that the Commission's synthesis report for the spring European Council in March 2002 is currently being prepared.
As requested by the European Council, that report will assess the progress made on the economic, social and environmental dimensions of the Lisbon strategy.
I mention the environmental dimension in particular since the Göteborg Summit.
Part of this assessment will consider the progress made by Council and Parliament on the Lisbon reform agenda.
The assessment will draw on the series of structural indicators which have been proposed by the Commission in its communication of 30 October 2001.
As Mrs Randzio-Plath knows, those structural indicators are a very accurate reflection of the progress made and the Commission thinks it is a valuable instrument.
The objective of sustainable development will underpin the assessment of each strand of that strategy.
The focus of the synthesis report will also depend on further work by this Parliament and the Council up to the end of this year.
It is somewhat early, therefore, to be specific about the contents and structure of the reports at this stage.
I agree nevertheless with Mrs Randzio-Plath that the synthesis report will need to take account of the likely situation by the time the Barcelona European Council is held.
This means, on the one hand, the new international situation to which she has referred, and, on the other hand, the introduction of the euro on 1 January next year.
At the recent informal summit in Ghent, Heads of State and Government and the Commission renewed their commitment to pursuing the Lisbon strategy of structural and economic reform and social renewal with determination as a response to both those factors, the new environment and the introduction of the euro.
Continuity and the long-term focus of the reform agenda will need to be maintained, especially in view of the current economic downturn.
The economic situation in the euro area and worldwide has made it necessary to adjust economic policy.
But the confirmation by the Ghent European Council of its commitment to the stability and growth pact has brought confidence that the basic policy framework of economic and monetary union will be preserved and it has certainly facilitated the recent further adjustments in monetary policy.
This shows that economic policy coordination is working.
Nonetheless there is still further scope for strengthening economic policy coordination in line with the proposals put forward by the Commission, with a view to fostering a common assessment of the economic situation and appropriate economic policy responses.
To reinforce that message, Mr Prodi is writing to this Parliament, to the President of the Council and to the Heads of State and Government this week, urging them to continue their efforts to make progress before Barcelona on key elements of the Lisbon reforms, such as the Community patent and the telecoms review, in line with the existing timetable, as well as on a number of the financial services proposals.
The synthesis report by its nature covers a wide area of the Commission's activity.
A number of Commission services are therefore contributing to its preparation and this work is being monitored at political level by a group of Commissioners dealing with growth, competitiveness, employment and sustainable development.
The report should be adopted by the Commission on 15 January 2002 and will be submitted to this Parliament on the same day.
By submitting the report at an early stage, it is intended to allow the other European institutions to give their views on the report in good time in order to contribute to the work of the European Council in Barcelona.
I believe that is precisely what Mrs Randzio-Plath wants.
Lastly, with regard to the open method of coordination, that is largely intended in the context of the Lisbon strategy to develop indicators at Member State level and to share best practice and experience.
It is used in line with the principles set out in the White Paper on governance in areas where legislative action under the methode communataire, the Community method, is not possible.
I hope I have answered the questions put by Mrs Randzio-Plath.
As I have said on earlier occasions, I shall be delighted to come and make a presentation to her committee and discuss what the Commission intends to do at the Barcelona Summit in further detail.
But it would be useful if my future discussion with the EMAC committee could take place after 15 January, because by then both Parliament and I will be in possession of the documents that will be the Commission's input into the Barcelona Council.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Liberal Group I would like to support the position expressed by the Chairperson of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the issue we are debating.
I am pleased that Commissioner Bolkestein has said that he is willing to discuss the content of the proposed synthesis report in committee, since it must be the basis for a discussion at a meeting which we hope will be very important and which will take place in my city and the city of the President for this sitting.
We therefore have a special interest in Barcelona being a genuine success and that it be remembered as a truly significant advance in terms of the commitments we have been taking on since the meeting in Lisbon last year.
I would like to insist on one aspect which both the Commission and the Liberal Group have been highlighting.
This is the need to consolidate and clarify the mechanisms and objectives in the field of economic and monetary policy.
There is a degree of confusion, as you know, and this has been discussed both in the Commission and in this House, between the Europe of the euro (which, as the Commissioner has said, is now close to completing its final stage with the introduction of notes and coins), the external representation of the euro and, on the other hand, the system for adopting decisions in the field of economic and monetary policy.
We know that this situation is unsatisfactory and the current crisis highlights this.
We hope that the present situation can be genuinely overcome, in the way that Commissioner Bolkestein' s colleague, Commissioner Solbes, has often said optimistically. However, at the same time he has been obliged to lower the growth forecasts.
I would therefore like to insist on this aspect and on another which the Commissioner has not mentioned and which I believe is very important within the various elements of Lisbon and their subsequent implementation: the training and technology element.
Lisbon set the objective of a fully competitive society by 2010, in which we would be able to overcome our technological and scientific backwardness in comparison with the United States, which was the term of reference established in Lisbon.
I believe that this is an element which also has to be introduced into this synthesis report, and at subsequent meetings views have been expressed in agreement with this.
I thank Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mrs Randzio-Plath for the remarks they have made. I stress the fact that progress made since Lisbon has been insufficient.
In the area of financial services, for example, the Commission intends to have a mid-term review meeting in February next year to stimulate more political interest in perfecting the internal market and achieving the difficult targets we were set by the Lisbon European Council.
But I stress that we have not done what we should have.
Considerable difficulties remain and we must use the meeting in Lisbon to make further progress.
It would be a good thing if Ecofin ministers were present in Barcelona so that they could do, on the spot, what members of the European Council want them to do.
So far members of the European Council have engaged in laudatory statements but when ministers have to deal with the subjects at hand the political will seems to evaporate.
If the Ecofin ministers were to be present at the Barcelona Council perhaps they could solve these problems there and then.
In the case of patents, the European Council has instructed the Council to come to a decision before Christmas this year.
I am not optimistic.
That underscores the need for the Barcelona European Council to be practical and emphasises the need to make more progress than have been made up until now.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Conversion of vessels and of fishermen dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0395/2001) by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation aiming to promote the conversion of vessels and of fishermen that were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco [COM(2001) 384 - C5-0407/2001 - 2001/0163(CNS)]
Mr President, the European Parliament is offering the Commission the opportunity to correct the proposed regulation it delivered to Parliament and the Council.
The intention of the report, approved by the Committee on Fisheries that we are discussing at the moment, is to correct the rigidity of this proposal, which is currently preventing progress being made in finding solutions to problems for the people affected by the non-renewal of the EC-Morocco fisheries agreement.
From the time the agreement expired, on 30 November 1999, until the time it became clear that a new agreement would not be reached, owners of more than 400 vessels and some 4 300 fishermen were both hopeful and fearful at the time when negotiations between the Community and Morocco were being prolonged.
It was not until 26 March 2001 that Commissioner Fischler announced that it had been impossible to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
From that moment, the Community set itself the objective of converting the affected fishing fleet.
By presenting this proposed regulation, the Commission is conforming to the guidelines set by the Nice European Council of 7 December 2000.
At that Summit, the European Council ordered the Commission to propose a specific action plan for the restructuring of this Community fleet.
I must state clearly that this proposed regulation does not conform to the needs of the sector in question.
Once again the Commission seems to be presenting proposals, the objective of which we do not understand, that do not amount to decisive action in support of a fleet and certain regions which are suffering a serious crisis.
In fact, rather than helping to preserve most of the fleet and its economic activity, the Commission is presenting a rigid proposal which, if the Council approves it without the substantial amendments approved by the Committee on Fisheries, will have the effect of breaking up a fleet for which the ship owners and local authorities of those regions feel capable of finding alternatives.
This proposal must therefore be amended in the way approved by the Committee on Fisheries, so that the actions proposed may have a beneficial effect on the sector in question.
The Committee on Fisheries does not share the Commission' s breaking-up approach.
The Commission could have focussed on the existing opportunities in alternative sectors, such as the processing industry, aquiculture and especially the promotion of fisheries products.
In the same way, the proposal excludes sectors directly affected by the non-renewal of the agreement, such as the non-extractive fisheries industries.
The land-based companies, during the long negotiation process, have suffered a series of economic setbacks that have led to employment rationalisations and redundancies, leading to considerable losses.
Today they are faced with a future just as uncertain as that of the fleet they depend on.
Faced with this breaking-up approach, the sector affected and the regional authorities have reached verbal agreements with companies and ship owners from various Maghreb countries to create mixed companies, and in this way, according to the estimates of the sector, in the small-scale sector, around a hundred vessels could be relocated with the help of this specific measure, if it were more flexible, thereby reducing to 26 those vessels destined for scrapping.
This would maintain an economic activity which is vital to certain regions and ensure that those who want to continue being ship owners and fishermen are able to do so.
The amendments contained in the Committee on Fisheries' report, in summary, modify the proposed regulation in the following fashion:
In addition to ship owners and fishermen, the land-based fisheries industry which was directly linked to the existence of this agreement are included, provided that their losses exceed 70%.
The requirement that the people affected must have been subsidised for a period of at least nine consecutive months as a result of inactivity in order to benefit now from this specific measure is removed.
This requirement leads to the exclusion of those people who, sometimes temporarily, found alternative work while waiting for a new fisheries agreement with Morocco to be reached.
This is all the more serious if we bear in mind that these ship owners and fishermen had not been warned that, if they found an activity, they would be penalised when it came to conversion.
The Committee on Fisheries has also rejected the requirement to return aid granted for modernisation.
It is not right to apply penalties of a backdated nature in the case of aid which was not subject to these conditions at the time of being granted.
The Commission' s proposal intends to increase public aid per ship owner by 20% in the case of scrapping or transfer to a third country.
The Committee on Fisheries believes that fishermen must also benefit from this increase of 20%.
We have also redistributed the sum allocated to this specific measure in such a way that the amount intended for scrapping is 30%, for the creation of mixed companies, 35%, and for socio-economic measures, also 35%.
This would lead to better implementation of the specific measure.
Lastly, I will mention the budgetary aspect.
In accordance with the conclusions of the Nice European Council, the Commission proposes granting up to EUR 197 million for this specific measure.
It proposes implementing the flexibility instrument in 2002 and allocating the appropriations corresponding to heading 2 of the financial perspectives.
The saving resulting from the non-renewal of the agreement has been EUR 500 million.
It is natural that the Community should also contribute to the cost of converting this fleet.
Mr President, this House may be listening for the last time to words relating to what, for fourteen years, we have known as the fisheries agreement with Morocco.
Tomorrow, on voting on the report we are debating today, our institution will write the last page of a story that has been told since August 1987, when the European Union signed its first fisheries agreement with that country, but which for Spain goes back almost twenty-five years.
There are therefore Community fishermen and ship owners whose lives have been exclusively linked with the existence of the Moroccan fishing grounds.
Our obligation today is to close this chapter with the greatest possible dignity and responsibility towards this sector, which is going to suffer an unprecedented fisheries conversion.
We must thank the Commission for their efforts over the last two long years to try to make tomorrow' s vote unnecessary.
But, given that the situation is irreversible, we must also recognise the solidarity contained in the Commission' s proposal, its recognition that the end of an era cannot be marked by the spectacle of us being miserly towards those people who are waiting anxiously for this plan in order to carry on living and working, the financial cost of which is fully justified.
We hope that the other institutions have sufficient dignity to accept this need.
The amendments introduced by the Committee on Fisheries, above all, contribute to adding a greater degree of flexibility in order to allow Community solidarity to truly benefit a very heterogeneous fleet, which over the last two years has not ceased to seek its own solutions; solutions which greater legislative rigidity may contribute to blocking.
Furthermore, our main obligation is to approve this report in order to provide the necessary legal basis so that on second reading of the budget the necessary appropriations can be provided to finance the restructuring plan.
This restructuring plan will no doubt put an end to part of an historic fleet, but it must not mean the end of fisheries relations with Morocco.
It is impossible to imagine that Morocco really wants to turn its back on the European Union, amongst other things because we share two seas and we are obliged to be neighbours, and Morocco can only benefit from this proximity.
I therefore ask the Commission to remain receptive and promote any mutually beneficial fishing cooperation initiative which may arise in the future.
It only remains for me to thank the rapporteur for the wonderful work she has done.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the draft Council regulation on the promotion of the conversion of vessels and of fishermen dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco, which is the subject of the excellent report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, deserves our unreserved approval.
The proposal shows that the European Union cares about the fate of such vulnerable and fragile activities, whose survival depended on the renewal or non-renewal of a fishing agreement with Morocco.
European solidarity works and continues to work.
That is for the sceptics.
The Commission proposal considers the problems of conversion from its economic and social angles.
It also has the merit of mobilising new money, EUR 197 million, which is compatible with the mobilisation of other resources already allocated under the Structural Funds.
In Portugal there are 570 fishermen who receive support under this programme, 400 of whom live in Sesimbra, a small, attractive fishing and tourist town very close to Lisbon.
Of these 400 who live in Sesimbra, 150 are already over 55 years old, which means they can be moved into early retirement, since at this age it is difficult to retrain them for a different job.
In simple terms, while the shipowners are liable to receive supplements of 20%, the same is not true for the fishermen, which to me seems an injustice.
Now, the fishermen will be able to get EUR 10 000 euros over one year if they do not do any other work.
The possibility of a 20% increase, although modest, would allow them to raise that sum to EUR 12 000, which would make it rather more attractive.
Furthermore, the proposal has quite a rigid structure and should be made more flexible, allowing the Member States, in this case Portugal and Spain, to adapt better to situations that are truly complex and sometimes do not fit within the rigid stays of the regulation.
This flexibility should be accepted so that the aid already granted by the end of 2001 should not all be accounted for under the part of FIFG Article 4 intended for socio-economic measures, and all of it within the Lisbon and Tagus valley region, and it would be better if it could be diluted in other programmes.
Lastly, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I entirely agree with the content and proposals of the report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, which I think are lucid and sensible, particularly those dealing with the possibility of supporting processing activities that were dependent on fishing.
Indeed, it does not make sense that certain fishery-dependent processing and marketing activities, which in this case have been hit very hard, should not also be funded.
For this reason, too, we are grateful for the report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos.
Mr President, I am pleased to inform the House that the UN Fish Stocks Agreement will enter into force on 11 December.
This follows the thirtieth ratification by Malta, shamefully with no ratifications by the EU.
Turning to Morocco, the Greens will be voting against this proposal, not because we oppose compensation for fishermen put out of work, but because we oppose this particular package.
Firstly it provides increased premiums for only certain people, those involved in Morocco.
This discriminates against other fishermen and ship owners.
Secondly, it will fund even more transfers of vessels to third countries, including flags of convenience, and there are still no controls in place to prevent this.
Thirdly, it sets a very bad precedent if every time an agreement collapses or problems entirely foreseeable arise, we decide to dish out huge sums of European taxpayers' money.
Clearly, the problem with fisheries agreements has to be addressed.
Morocco is the first, but there are more to come.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mrs Miguélez for the excellent work she has done.
Its quality is all the more notable insofar as it deals with an issue which is hugely traumatic for a large number of people who depend on fishing in Portugal and in Galicia, Andalucia and the Canary Islands in Spain.
It is a question of finding the best possible way to alleviate the effects of what I believe to be, if you pardon the expression, the chronicle of a death foretold.
For a long time my group has been warning the House of the risks of not linking the fisheries agreement with Morocco to the association agreement.
Today all I can say is that the Kingdom of Morocco has not shown the willingness to negotiate that we expect from a trading partner.
I would like to acknowledge the Commission' s efforts to lessen the impact of the lack of an agreement with Morocco, but I am not going to repeat what has already been said.
It is sufficient to refer to the interventions of the rapporteur and Mrs Fraga, for example, to realise that the Committee on Fisheries has considerably improved on the Commission' s proposal, by making it fairer.
In this respect, it only remains for me to ask, as my group will do, the House to approve the report of the Committee on Fisheries, written by Mrs Miguélez, tomorrow, and that, once approved by Parliament, the report may quickly be provided with the appropriate financial instruments so that it can be implemented.
And, in this respect, I would like to make it clear that the budgetary flexibility instrument is essential.
Ladies and gentlemen, it would be horrendous, to give an example, if an Objective 1 region, with the highest unemployment rate in the European Union, which also suffers the consequences of the competition created by the very favourable agreements which we, Europeans, have granted to Morocco in the fruit products sector, not only suffered the effects of a tough conversion as a result of the lack of an agreement with Morocco, but that, furthermore, as a result of the budgetary miserliness of certain people, it also ended up without Structural Funds.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since it is so late, I will try to be very brief and concise.
Firstly, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez, for the good work she has done despite the urgency of the issue.
I would also like to congratulate all the members of the Committee on Fisheries for the work they have done.
I believe that together we have all been able to meet the demands of the circumstances: the rapporteur, the authors of the amendments, those who have made it possible to reach compromises and the Members who have supported us. I thank them all for their understanding and solidarity.
The urgency procedure, as I said, always obliges us to work more quickly than we would have liked, but, even so, the result has been very positive.
I now hope the Commission takes account of the significant improvements which the Committee on Fisheries has introduced into its proposal.
I will highlight the extension of aid, better coverage and, above all, the flexibility introduced into the application of the various measures under discussion.
Secondly, we must speak about the funding of this plan, although this is not strictly an issue for our committee.
In Nice, the Council made a political commitment at the highest level, at the level of Heads of State and Government, to the people affected by the dramatic situation created following the failure of the negotiations with Morocco.
I believe that the European Commission has also been able to meet the demands of the circumstances, and I would like to acknowledge that here: the use of the flexibility instrument and the EUR 197 million it proposes for funding demonstrate this.
I therefore congratulate them.
I now ask Parliament' s Committee on Budgets and the Council to support the European Commission and the European Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries and reach the necessary compromise so that this essential EUR 197 million can be used for the proposed purpose.
There is a political commitment and a favourable opinion from this Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries and we strongly urge that they be complied with.
Mr President, it is vital that this report should be approved so that a decision can be taken at the next Fisheries Council on the restructuring programme for the fleet that operated in Morocco and that has been idle since the end of 1999, affecting Portuguese and Spanish fishermen and shipowners and the populations of the areas where they live.
The fact is that compensation for the stoppage finishes at the end of this year.
The central question, then, is the allocation of EUR 197 million for the restructuring programme that is to commence in January 2002, which should be improved along the lines proposed in the Miguélez Ramos report.
For our part, we consider the proposal the Commission has made of using a flexibility instrument in the budget to be acceptable, and we regret that the matter was not made clearer during the first reading of the budget by the European Parliament, inserting the amounts on the line and requesting the use of the flexibility instrument, as in fact the Committee on Fisheries had proposed, as our chairman has just reminded us.
It is, therefore, important that the next Budgetary Council should stop blocking and take these proposals into account, creating the solution that will allow the fleet restructuring programme to come into force early next year.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is late, but we are awake, wide-awake even.
The alarm bells are ringing, the Gordian knot has not yet been hacked in two, but Parliament, I hope, is not giving up.
What is at stake here?
At stake are jobs and the way the people of Europe perceive the EU.
Thanks to the emergency motion tabled by our colleague, Daniel Varela, we have an opportunity this evening to discuss an issue which is as problematic as it is urgent.
It concerns how to deal openly and honestly with the consequences which the failure of the negotiations with Morocco have had for the Iberian peninsular.
The bare facts are quickly stated: since November 1990, we have heard, the EU fleet - in practice deep-sea fishermen from Spain and Portugal - has no longer been able to fall back on the resources off the coast of Morocco.
The 4 300 fishermen and 400 vessels affected are hoping that the compensation payments will be continued when they expire in December 2001, as Mrs Miguélez Ramos has explained to us so convincingly.
Behind these figures there are people, families and whole communities who are committed to a traditional industry and we now need to give that industry prospects for the future.
In so doing, our efforts should certainly not be confined solely to giving financial handouts.
It is much more important that we - and here I would bring the Commission and the Council on board too - succeed in producing a comprehensive plan which is convincing and whose aim is to provide reduced, but no less profitable, fishing activity, or alternative work.
I would take this report as a further direct indication of how extremely important and urgent it is to reform the European Union's common fisheries policy, a task which is occupying all of us at the moment.
It is no coincidence that the individual key words - external relations, trade agreements, capacity reduction and extensive restructuring - are also a leitmotif in the working documents on the reform.
The current situation in Spain and Portugal also highlights the fact that it is now high time to conclude a package which is really worthy of the name reform.
It is unacceptable to reduce members of a proud industry to the level of being simply recipients of charity.
As a Community of values we must not allow this.
Falling yields have, I believe, helped us to recognise the huge challenges.
Let us now work together to identify the right action to take and let us show the flexibility which the rapporteur and also other colleagues have reminded us is so important.
Mr President, the proposal that the Commission is putting forward is to be welcomed but needs improving.
I shall highlight three aspects in this regard: the first is that there is no sense in the rigidity that the draft regulation imposes regarding the percentage of the funding to be allocated to each type of measure.
What would make sense would be to allow each Member State the flexibility, within the overall envelope, to allocate these funds according to its own needs, with clear rules.
For instance, in the case of Portugal, funds for destroying vessels should be reduced and funds for restructuring some of these ships and for the social part should be increased.
Secondly, an envelope of this kind should also include funding for the economic conversion of the areas most affected by fishing, and include in this compensation framework collateral activities such as the processing industry.
This would mean, right from the outset, that the financial envelope would need reinforcing, which unfortunately has not happened in this proposal by the Commission, which even so is arguing about certain problems of budgetary procedure.
The third aspect I should like to highlight is that, in the Commission' s view, the aim of this aid is essentially to close a chapter in the common fisheries policy, which was the agreement with Morocco, without making the effort which I believe was needed to expand the fishing possibilities for these countries in third countries' waters, and without duly providing for measures, which again were needed, to help these companies become more international more easily.
The Committee on Fisheries has tabled some amendments, and I should like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, who has made such an effort in this process.
We, ourselves, have also tried to do our part with amendments that will clearly improve this proposal where it has gaps.
As Mrs Fraga Estévez said, since there was no political ability to negotiate at the right time, I hope that there will now be dignity in the answers we are going to give to the fishermen affected.
I also hope that this House will approve the proposal by the Committee on Fisheries and that the Council will do the job it has to do.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking and congratulating Mrs Miguélez Ramos, the vice-chairperson of the Committee on Fisheries, for her report on this extremely important regulation which aims at facilitating conversion for those thousands of fishermen and hundreds of vessels whose activity has been suddenly cancelled because it has not been possible to conclude a new fishery agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco.
Beyond the availability of existing instruments, the Community has decided to make a special effort with a twofold initiative.
Firstly, the Council regulation aiming at widening the scope of existing provisions and, secondly, additional credits for a specific action.
While the proposal for additional credits is currently being discussed by the budgetary authority, today's debate focuses on the legislative proposal.
The Commission welcomes the fact that the emergency procedure should allow the adoption of the regulation by the end of November instead of the end of December.
The report includes 18 amendments, which may be grouped in a few categories, which I shall review now.
The first group consists of Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5, 10, 11 and 13.
The Commission does not believe that the land-based industries - that is to say, fish-processing factories, as well as services to vessels - ought to benefit from the new regulation, nor should the coastal regions themselves.
Indeed, regional development programmes already exist, and those industries in need of conversion or those coastal communities in need of diversification should benefit from the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund.
Aquaculture and the fish-processing industry should benefit from the financial instrument for fisheries guidance.
The second group of amendments consists of Amendments Nos 3 and 4. The Commission does not believe that all fishermen and vessel owners who have received indemnities in 2000-2001, irrespective of the actual duration of the cessation of activity, should benefit from the new regulation.
Therefore a minimum duration of compensation, as a simple criterion, has been proposed and a nine-month duration has been considered a reasonable minimum.
Moreover, until now, no evidence has been given that such a duration would penalise those who have tried to find alternative activities and are still in a difficult situation.
The third group consists of Amendments Nos 6, 7 and 8. With respect to the age of vessels to be withdrawn, the Commission has proposed to reduce the minimum age to five years in the case of the exporting of vessels.
All other rules should be maintained.
Moreover, the Commission has proposed that the accumulation of grants for construction should be prevented premiums for withdrawal.
Any alternative rule would be against the sound management of public money, and therefore the Commission could not support those amendments.
On Amendments Nos 9 and 12, the Commission would stress that social premiums for fishermen are already available in the existing regulation.
Nonetheless, it may support increasing those premiums in the new regulation.
However, Spain and Portugal should guarantee that such increased premiums do not create distortion in relation to equivalent social premiums that may be available for workers of other industries in the same Member States.
I turn to Amendments Nos 14 and 15. The additional credits are not structural funds.
Providing them allows the Commission to set up some rules. Those rules should be in line with today' s priorities, which amount to scrapping redundant vessels and also to social measures.
No 'adjustment' or 'variation' should be allowed.
Then there is Amendment No 16. From the Commission' s perspective, granting a joint enterprise in the fisheries sector is quite a risky action.
Two legal provisions limit that risk: firstly a bank guarantee, and secondly, a partially delayed payment (that is, after two years of satisfactory operation).
The budget rules for using additional credits imply the relaxation of the second provision, but the Commission is willing to maintain its financial risk at the same level.
Therefore it has proposed to balance that loss by increasing the bank guarantee to 40% of the premium.
But that is a purely mechanical calculation.
Then there is Amendment No 17. If the budgetary authority decides to earmark all the commitment credits dedicated to the specific action in the budgetary year 2002, the wording of that article should remain unchanged.
Otherwise it should be adjusted accordingly.
Lastly, Amendment No 18, which has no practical consequence.
The wording of Article 7 should remain consistent with the wording of the equivalent articles of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999.
In conclusion, the Commission has a favourable opinion of Amendments Nos 9 and 12, and my colleague, Mr Fischler, will propose to the Fisheries Council that it includes them in the new regulation.
Amendment No17 may be considered, depending upon the decision taken by the budgetary authority.
I was speaking on behalf of my colleague, Mr Fischler, who, I am sure, will deal with any questions that I was unable to answer.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Madam President, I had not managed to reach my seat.
I wanted to make a very brief comment: my name does not appear on the attendance register and I wanted to say that I was present at both the sitting and the corresponding vote.
I know that this relates to Monday's sitting, but I did want to have it included in the Minutes.
Many thanks.
Obviously I did not sign in, but I was here and I did take part.
Thank you!
Very well, Mr Ebner, it will be rectified.
Are there any other comments on the Minutes?
Madam President, before the debate begins, I just want to pass on the feelings of the people in Ireland regarding the future of our national airline Aer Lingus.
Prior to the terrorism in New York, it was a star performer in the airline industry, carrying 1.1 million passengers.
It is a great provider to our national economy.
There is a great wish that it not be regarded as the government giving national aid to keep this flying.
That is not really a comment about the Minutes, and besides, there is going to be a debate on that subject.
Are there any other comments about the Minutes?
(The Minutes were approved).
Madam President, I just wanted to bring to your attention the arrest in Greece a week ago of twelve British subjects and two Dutch subjects.
Among the British subjects were two of my constituents, Paul and Lesley Coppin from Mildenhall in Suffolk.
They have been arrested by the Greek authorities on charges of espionage.
These people are plane spotters, aviation enthusiasts, on holiday in Greece.
It does seem to me rather extraordinary that they are still being held in custody in a fellow Member State, and I wonder if there is something that you can do to bring this matter to the attention of the Greek authorities in order they be released as soon as possible.
Mr Van Orden, we have taken note of your comments and we shall take whatever action is appropriate.
Economic and employment situation in the air transport sector and in the industrial and related services sectors
The next item calls for statements by the Council and the Commission on the economic and employment situation in the air transport sector and in the industrial and related services sectors.
Mrs Durant will now speak on behalf of the Council.
Madam President, European air transport policy had and still has serious structural weaknesses.
The events of 11 September have exacerbated the current situation exponentially.
The number of passengers on the main carriers has fallen dramatically and has now bottomed out at 20% lower than in 2000. The airlines recently announced 30,000 redundancies.
Two national carriers, Sabena and Swissair, have folded.
When Sabena folded, 7,500 people lost their jobs from one day to the next.
And we cannot exclude the possibility of further job losses in the industry at European level.
Last week I met European partners representing all sectors of the air transport industry.
Their description was most interesting.
The airlines operate in a global village.
A global village which has been hit by an earthquake and all its buildings, both large and small, strong and weak, are teetering.
So how are we to cope at European level with part of a problem of truly global dimensions?
I think that it is important for us to send out a clear message, and I agree completely with Minister Durant here: we shall not be doing the industry any favours if we allow the economic crisis provoked by 11 September to delay decisions to restructure and unify the industry.
The main message must be that the proper response is to restructure the airline industry.
It is important that we agree that we cannot help the industry with a massive injection of public funds but, at the same time, we must understand that we cannot restructure in a time of crisis without additional economic and social tools.
The communication which the European Commission approved on 10 October entitled "The repercussions of the terrorist attacks in the United States on the air transport industry" is an initial reaction to this extraordinary situation and therefore focuses on restoring confidence by planning additional safety measures, coupled with economic measures to support the industry.
Of course, I fully agree with the Minister that, because of our institutional configuration and specific policies in the European Union, we are unable, unlike the United States of America, to react directly and support European airlines.
This communication contains a number of important points and measures.
The European Commission is examining measures, in the light of state aid rules, on compensating airlines for the damage which they sustained over the four days during which American airspace was closed.
This compensation must be granted without exception to all airlines licensed by the Member State.
The European Commission will examine various measures, again in the light of state aid rules, on compensation for the cost of additional insurance and continuing state intervention up to the end of this year.
The Commission is currently checking a number of medium-term monthly insurance plans on the basis of competition rules and internal market legislation relating to insurance.
And it is examining the possibility of a longer-term solution to the problem of insurance within the framework of the European Commission.
Finally, the Commission and the Council of Transport Ministers have called on the Member States to check that third world carriers can provide the same level of insurance cover as that which is going to be required of European airlines.
If we are to be able to restructure and stabilise the air transport industry as we must, the problem of ownership and control needs to be resolved now more than ever.
The restrictions imposed on airlines by traditional rules of ownership and control in bilateral air transport service agreements make mergers and acquisitions and external investment very difficult, even if the companies are in dire economic straits, which is why the Community desperately needs a dynamic common policy in the external relations sector.
The European Commission has been asking the Council for years now for negotiating guidelines on an EU/USA air traffic agreement in order to set the procedure in question in motion.
This sort of agreement would benefit our air transport industry.
Finally, given the rules on landing and take-off slots, the Commission takes the view that the situation is highly critical and agrees to propose that airport coordinators allow carriers to keep the slots which they did not use during the summer of 2001 and during the current 2001/2002 winter period for the same programming periods next year.
The President-in-Office of the Council has set out the specific problems and the need for a direct European policy and agreement at European level very clearly.
I will not go over them again; instead I shall focus a little longer on the question of the social crisis.
As I mentioned earlier, there have already been 30,000 redundancies in the space of a few weeks across all sectors and we are currently conducting a study to see what the repercussions will be on sectors working with the airlines.
The analysis of the cause of the redundancies is throwing up many and varied factors.
Some are due to the crisis per se, which started last spring. Others are due to a fall in demand.
Some to the delay in adjusting capacity in order to correct the ratio between supply and demand after years of strong growth.
It is difficult to analyse the causes for all the redundancies immediately, but we shall certainly have to see where we can intervene directly and what part the European Union and the European Commission should play.
First of all, there is a relatively complete legal framework which allows companies to negotiate with their employees in order to find new working models in a bid to keep redundancies to a minimum.
British Airways and Alitalia, which have made a great many employees redundant, are already working with and keeping the workers' representatives abreast of developments.
But of course legislation cannot stop the current round of redundancies, which is why available Community resources need to be used to deal with the fallout from the crisis.
There is an economic tool at European level - I refer to the European Social Fund - which can be used in three ways: first through the European Employment Strategy, for training and retraining employees made redundant or, often, in order to help them maintain their skills, which they risk losing on such a specialised job market.
The second way is by subsidising salaried employees whose jobs are at risk.
The problem of small and medium-sized satellite enterprises surrounding the airlines has already been raised.
The third way is for local and regional authorities to mobilise action programmes through the Social Fund to deal, for example, with the closure of small airports or local problems caused by redundancies or crises in specific sectors, so that they can be dealt with at regional level.
As far as the financial regulations for the European Social Fund are concerned, it is regulated at European level, but we have the flexibility to redirect funds in times of crisis or in special circumstances.
Certain measures for Sabena will be jointly funded by the European Social Fund.
These are the legislative and social tools currently available.
Of course, one of the most important tools in times of crisis is social dialogue and discussion with the social partners.
The European Commission set the European sectoral dialogue on air transport issues in motion following the crisis on 11 September.
We have already held meetings with the social partners through the Social Dialogue Committee and it has been decided that a European workshop will be held on 3 December, attended by all the sectors at social partner level and by national delegates from the fifteen Member States, in order to discuss the specific question of the repercussions on employment and the nascent social problems, in a bid to reach a joint agreement on measures which we can take into direct consideration.
Madam President, at this time of crisis, when it is hard to find answers and a recipe for recovery, we need proper and direct collaboration both between the European institutions and between the European institutions and the social partners before taking further steps.
Mr President, the reason for this urgent resolution is self-evident.
I should like firstly to thank the representatives from the other groups involved in drawing together this compromise.
It is true to say that since the attacks on the USA in September the aviation industry has suffered catastrophic consequences, not least on passenger confidence, but in addition for the tens of thousands of jobs which have already been lost worldwide and in particular across Europe.
Unfortunately this situation is not confined to the airline industry.
The knock-on effects are now evident, both in the aerospace manufacturing sector and in tourism.
In my own country, the United Kingdom, the slow recovery following the foot-and-mouth epidemic has suffered a major setback which is truly hard to bear.
Whatever the failures of some of the companies in the European Union to face the challenges of the business world, the vast majority of businesses have, through no fault of their own, found themselves on the brink of bankruptcy, or even worse.
I recall my own government, along with other national leaders, insisting within three or four days of the incident that help would be given as quickly as possible.
Unfortunately, apart from the short-term assistance concerning insurance cover, which should have been 180 days as at the outset in the United States, no financial help has been forthcoming.
I am not aware of any compensation for financial losses due to the closure of US airspace and airports, or for the additional security measures that the aviation industry has been expected to put in place.
It is Member States which should assume responsibility for security costs.
In short, the situation is a disgrace, not least because job losses outlined two months ago by many businesses are already escalating due to the lack of help.
We in this Parliament want action - and we want it now.
We are not interested in waiting for some case-by-case consideration by the Commission which may be agreed some time in the future.
We demand that interim financial aid packages be made available now to those eligible.
In conclusion, I must inform the Commission and the Council that it is my intention to keep this issue at the top of the agenda and I expect at the very least a report back to this Parliament at the November II part-session on the progress that has been made.
I hope that fellow MEPs will support the comments I have made, because we must remember that thousands of livelihoods are at stake.
Inaction is not an option, nor is a lecture on environmental issues, because at the rate we are going we will not have an aviation industry to worry about.
Madam President, I came to the Chamber this morning with a prepared speech about the situation in the airline industry.
I have radically altered that, in view of what I have heard from the President-in-Office and the Commissioner this morning.
Frankly, what we have heard is totally unacceptable.
We are faced with a classic scenario of the Council of Ministers fiddling like some modern-day Nero while the aviation industry of the European Union burns.
Madam President-in-Office, we are in a deep crisis.
You, more than anybody else, should know that from your own Member State.
Airlines have gone bankrupt.
Others are on the brink of bankruptcy - and what response do we get?
We get a suggestion that the Commission can go and sit down with the Americans and talk to them about the aid they are giving to try and level the playing field.
By the time that happens there will not be a European civil aviation industry left to put on that level playing field!
We need action now.
We do not want fiddling at the edges, we want direct action so that our civil aviation industry can survive and have a future of its own.
The response from the United States after the events of 11 September was direct and straight to the point.
They made USD 5 billion available to their airlines straight away and offered another USD 10 billion in indirect aid to help them over other crises should they arise.
And what did we do?
We fiddled at the edges and said, "Well, we might do this" and, as Mrs Foster said, "Well, we said you could pay compensation for the lost days".
That is not enough.
We need direct action now.
What appalled me today was the tone of the contribution from the Commission and the President-in-Office.
It is as if they are accepting that airlines will have to go bust and that thousands of jobs will have to go, without doing anything to stop it.
Before today I suspected that Member States wanted to use this crisis to consolidate the industry, to get rid of some of the airlines.
Well, today the President-in-Office all but admitted that this is the case.
If that is so, then I condemn it.
Members of the trade unions are with us today in the gallery.
I say to them: I give you the support of my group in the quest to keep a European civil aviation industry alive.
Sadly, from what I have heard today, a similar commitment from the Council of Ministers seems to be a good way off.
I just wonder, Madam President-in-Office, whether people in history will remember the Belgian presidency of the year 2001 as the presidency that oversaw the demise of Europe's civil aviation industry.
Madam President, I feel that a situation such as this requires us to keep calm.
My group supported the motion and is prepared to take part in any way it can in any action addressing the current situation quickly and immediately - and, I hope, effectively.
Three lines of action must be pursued: defending European industry fully against any unfair competition from the United States in the future; speeding up the restructuring of European industry itself; and meeting the obligations, which we had, moreover, already established before the crisis, to ensure, in any event, improved conditions of safety and respect for the environment than those hitherto in operation.
Europe has many objectives, which it must pursue simultaneously if we are to pull ourselves out of this situation.
This certainly means that we need the Council to confer a negotiating mandate upon the Commission as soon as possible, we need to be able to speak with one voice before the United States and we need to be able to monitor what happens on that front. In other words, we must either defend ourselves or ensure that we all play according to the same rules in this situation.
However, the need to defend ourselves against attack from an industry which has taken less time to complete restructuring, which has regained its competitiveness first, must not be used an excuse not to change the current situation.
Therefore, we need to honour our aid commitments, within the limits laid down for aid for the past financial year, for insurance costs and for the extra security costs, but no more than this.
We must consistently maintain state aid within this framework and, what is more, be very astute in our management of the restructuring phases.
There is no doubt that European industry will have to go through some rather painful stages as it re-establishes itself and, therefore, it is quite likely that there may be more bankruptcies.
However, there are different ways of handling them.
That is a fundamental point, one on which it might be appropriate for both the Council of Ministers and the Commission to do more, to produce a few more proposals on how the transitions are to be handled.
One tiny example: the bankruptcy of Sabena or the restructuring of the new Sabena has led to a debate now on the allocation of slots on European routes.
There are small, competitive companies able to take on, to employ people who would be willing to take part in co-sharing operations on European routes.
Well then, we must not restrict ourselves to defence but be open to these possibilities too, in short, to a faster developing market: we must have the courage and the ability to keep up with it with active as well as defensive measures.
In this way, I feel we will also be able to meet the needs of the trade unions and workers very well, aware that this is the right way to ensure that there genuinely will be jobs in the long term.
One last point: this issue affects the services related to the aviation industry as well as airlines; it affects the whole tourist industry.
If we do not succeed in restoring the confidence of our fellow citizens and persuading them to start flying again, much of the work we are doing will be wasted.
I have not yet heard anyone address this matter, but I feel it is the final task before us all.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, my group supports the policies set out by the Council Presidency and the Commission.
I believe that we should be careful not to miss the point here.
The air transport sector is experiencing a cyclical and structural crisis, as has been pointed out, but the whole of the European economy - and of the world economy - is also in crisis.
The real response to the employment problem is therefore, of course, to relaunch growth and general policies of social solidarity and job creation.
As far as the air transport sector is concerned, and in connection with the meeting on the social dialogue referred to by Mrs Diamantopoulou, I believe that the deterioration in working conditions and wages that is starting to occur in this sector is obviously a point to which we must pay a great deal of attention.
Moreover, at the level of the European Union, we would like to see the Community' s competition policy adopted and, far from preventing the restructuring of the sector, coming to the aid of that sector, and we should also like this medium-term restructuring policy to be compatible with the policies set out in the White Paper on transport policy, in other words the development of a multi-mode transport policy which reflects, in the medium term, the real situation regarding costs for all sectors as a whole.
Finally, and I believe that it is necessary to draw attention to this point, this Parliament has always voted, by a clear majority, against any spiralling in state aids.
I would find it hard to understand if the majority of this House were to unleash a spiralling growth in state aid to one particular sector.
Finally, on the subject of the United States, let us be clear among ourselves. The United States of America have presented us with a policy which is a fait accompli.
Their position on aid to their air transport sector is unacceptable and contrary to fair competition at international level.
Since we cannot, apparently, take the issue to the WTO, it is essential that in the context of the overall partnership between the United States and Europe, the European Union should be able to protect those legitimate interests which will, in the long term, work to the benefit of both the American and the European airlines.
Madam President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the economic and employment situation in the airline industry and in the related industrial and services sectors is critical.
Although this situation was not caused solely by the events of 11 September, it was made much more acute as a result.
Air passengers' confidence has fallen leading to a reduction in passenger numbers, losses have been incurred because of the closure of American airspace and airports, insurance cover has been withdrawn and there has been a decline in the numbers of tourists from the USA and the Far East: these are the main causes, as is the cancellation or postponing of orders for new aircraft.
The fundamental causes of this crisis are, however, of a structural nature: crippling competition between the airlines, built-in overcapacity, a general economic recession and bad decisions by management.
This motion for a European Parliament resolution refers to a host of necessary measures, for example compensation for the closure of airspace and airports, financial support or guarantees from the Member States to compensate for insurance cover being withdrawn, proposals on providing financial support to the European air transport sector so as to establish a level playing field with the United States and strategies to safeguard or create jobs.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left supports this motion, although we are aware that it is intended as a very short-term measure and can only constitute a first step, but a step which should be taken immediately.
In the medium and long term, we need a harmonised European airspace, higher standards of quality and safety, highly trained staff, high social standards and no low wages.
The mass redundancies which were announced in the air transport sector even before 11 September are absolutely unacceptable to us.
We need a strategy to coordinate the different modes of transport; we need an all-embracing European transport strategy.
This problem cannot be solved on a mode-by-mode basis.
Mr President, after the shock of 11 September, the tragic scale of the crisis in the aviation industry and its related services was already apparent, but the situation has become even more complex with the events of recent days. We are now faced with a problem: the problem of the crisis in general and a problem of safety too, which, if the theory on the plane crash should prove to be true, would prompt us to focus more closely on the issue of servicing of aircraft for safety purposes.
Without a doubt, the state of war and the economics of war then precipitated events into a genuine crisis for the airlines which has already had extreme consequences for Sabena and Swissair.
As has already been pointed out, the crisis, due to many different causes, not least - there is no doubt - clear strategic mismanagement of the sector, with airlines (which we might describe as too individualistic) unwilling to form consortia, which would have allowed them to streamline human, structural and financial resources; we have seen pricing policies which are misguided and often seeking to evade competition law; there are airports - such as Malpensa, to quote an example from my country - which are unreliable in terms of safety as well.
It is clear today that, in the current situation, the issue has reached dramatic, critical proportions, with the loss of at least 30 thousand jobs in Europe and 180 thousand jobs worldwide.
In Italy, my country' s national airline company has contemplated recapitalisation.
It is preparing itself to take draconian measures, with a further 1 000 job cuts on top of the 2 500 already announced.
Italiatour, Eurofly and the IT services company Sigma Travel will be drastically reduced in size, if not abolished.
The recapitalisation will have to be endorsed by Brussels.
The Commission had already authorised, on 17 October, payment of a public subsidy of EUR 387 million, but Alitalia needs EUR 1.5 billion and we do not know how useful the shares created by the Treasury by issuing bonds will be.
Strengthening commercial links with Air France or joining the Skyteam consortium are likely to be more effective in terms of structural reform.
In conclusion, we endorse the joint motion for a resolution and we feel that the situation calls for various different types of action from the European Union, extremely urgent action which, with the precious help of the European social partners, will succeed in firmly stopping the severely critical situation from further deteriorating now.
Subsequently, however, it will be necessary to plan action to modernise and streamline the sector and to take clear, incisive measures to boost tourism, which, as has already been pointed out, is a sector which, all too often, to be honest, is discussed at length but in which very little is as yet being done.
Lastly, we hope that the forthcoming reflections on the White Paper on transport will lead to resolute, incisive undertakings to support the transport and tourism sector' s economy, helping the many workers and their families, in particular, who must not be allowed to suffer further misfortune.
Madam President, the terrorist massacres of 11 September and last Monday' s aircraft disaster have jolted us into an awareness of the transience of life and to the way in which our society is interconnected.
An attack in the United States is also an attack on the rest of the civilised world, and vice versa.
Now the effects are making themselves increasingly felt, we must also look to solve the economic implications. In our opinion, the solution should fit into the line that the European Union has adopted in the transport sector.
In principle, businesses must operate without direct government subsidies.
Whether or not we should make an exception in this case should, however, be placed in the correct context.
After all, aviation is a worldwide market.
It is not acceptable, therefore, for European companies to go under because governments refuse to grant emergency aid, while elsewhere, government participation keeps companies afloat.
In view of the measures which the United States has taken, the zero option has been ruled out for the European Union.
We will need to establish, therefore, how far we can, want, and are able to, go, and the sooner the better.
This question is not restricted to aviation.
Indeed, in addition to aviation, there are all kinds of related industries, including tourism, that have been hit hard.
We must also distinguish between short-term and long-term measures.
In the first instance, aid must remain restricted to the industry affected and to the damage which is the direct result of 11 September.
The payment of insurance costs is logical and, in principle, a certain compensation for lost income is also necessary, because otherwise there would probably only be a few airline companies left in the European Union.
However, that does not mean that we will prevent already financially unstable businesses from folding under the veil of compensation.
I would now like to focus on the longer term. Since aviation has acquired a global character and attractive services are on offer, businesses are increasingly forced to seek economies of scale.
As a result, fewer companies will remain in business, not only in the European Union, but also outside.
The sector will then become truly global. National and bilateral legislation, as well as certain existing rights, must be tailored to this.
It is not national claims, but the market that plays a decisive role in respect of such rights.
In that light, I endorse the measures which the European Commission is proposing and I expect that they will also be able to benefit the European Union in other areas.
Madam President, the bankruptcy of the Belgian airline company Sabena a few days ago is not only the biggest bankruptcy in Belgian history, but it is first and foremost a human and social tragedy for between approximately 7 500 and 12 000 workers.
It has already been said, and it is obvious, that Sabena is not an isolated incident.
There are a huge number of airline companies that are going through very difficult times, and the events of 11 September have only made matters worse.
I am aware of this, but with regard to Sabena, it has to be said that the President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Durant, has kept two fundamental facts from this Parliament.
Firstly, Sabena has been continuously loss making for the last 40 years, except for one year, and that was probably thanks to an accountancy trick.
For the past 40 years, the taxpayers have had to inject no less than BEF 62 billion into that company.
Secondly, the cause.
Sabena was a Belgian public company with all the hallmarks of the Belgian State and of the Parti Socialiste.
That translated into political profiteering, political appointments of the manifestly incompetent and political interference by the Belgian Royal House to keep the company in French-speaking hands.
For that reason, the alliance with KLM was sabotaged.
Everyone knows that in my country.
In fact, parliament is currently setting up a parliamentary inquiry committee in order to scrutinise years of mismanagement, and, in my country, this is saying something.
We are all agreed that the airline industry is having a bumpy ride, and we must find a solution in Europe on the basis of a policy of "Europe first" as long as the Americans are putting "America first" .
However, in the Sabena dossier, we must first of all identify those responsible, notably in the Belgian Royal House and in the successive Belgian Governments.
Mr President, needless to say, airline companies, the aviation industry and tourism are the primary and most visible victims of 11 September, but let us not forget that outside tourism, many small- and medium-sized enterprises and their workers in the supply industry and in the geographical vicinity of airports, will also be directly affected by the tragedy.
In Belgium, the small- and medium-sized enterprises expect one redundancy per job lost at Sabena.
In our view, it should be ensured that government aid, in whatever form, benefits all industries affected.
We are also relying on the fact that the measures which the Commission can take are carried out promptly and on a large scale. The following measures spring to mind in the first instance: the creating of scope for government investments in the safety of air transport, the prompt handling of specific financial aid dossiers and extended flexibility, albeit limited in time, in slot management.
The extremely difficult situation should also prompt the Commission to clamp down on competition-distorting practices in transatlantic relations.
In this day and age, we are dependent on many factors.
If they all go wrong at the same time, we will end up with a right mess, and Sabena is a tragic case in point.
As a Belgian MP, I would urge that DAT be treated like any other airline company that is being affected by the effects of 11 September.
DAT should also be seen as a company that is being restructured, and must have access to the same facilities which other companies would have at their disposal in the same situation.
Finally, I wish the workers and independent businesses that are the victims of this situation a great deal of strength, and I hope that we can offer them better prospects in the short term.
Mr President, faced with the social catastrophe which the collapse of Sabena represents for Belgium, I should like to add a little humanity to this sitting, by dedicating my first words to all those who, from one day to the next, found themselves, to put it bluntly, deprived of their jobs.
I would ask those who would seek to use this specific issue in order to criticise public enterprises to measure well the responsibilities of all those concerned.
Yes, Europe is responsible when, along with the Commission, certain parties urge rapid, inhumane and brutal liberalisation, and yes, Europe now appears to everyone to be the real driving force behind this process.
People no longer want this kind of Europe.
They now want to construct with us a social Europe, the Europe that we defended at Lisbon, which develops convergence indicators in order to increase employment and combat unemployment, in other words a Europe which refuses to be dictated to by the market.
The 12 000 Sabena workers who were dismissed at the beginning of this month are the first victims of this wave of liberalisation in civil aviation.
The results of other European companies are giving cause for concern.
Thousands of people are afraid of being thrown out of work, and they cannot understand the intransigence of the European Commission over repayment times for bridging loans to the Belgian company, while the United States are spending billions of dollars on subsidising their national airlines so that they can keep their European slots.
They find it unacceptable that the Commission should give preference to sanctions and ukases, in the name of the virtues of liberalism and the market, while at the same time that out-of-control liberalism culminates in companies in Europe closing down one after the other.
By setting up the Lisbon process, the Community authorities and the Member States have proved that they are capable of taking into account the human and territorial consequences implied by every decision.
Such blind liberalisation will do nothing to advance the cause of the European idea or to increase confidence in Europe' s institutions and in our plans for peace and social progress.
It will inevitably lead the public to reject this European and simplistic vision.
Commissioner, the European Parliament' s vote on the Langen report two days ago, confirmed that there are certain sectors that should not be open to competition, and among those sectors are the sectors with which you are concerned.
Let us be clear about this, we do not reject the idea of modern and efficient public enterprises, and we do not want them to be sacrificed and ridiculed.
We are waiting for a forward-looking vision of economic development, a project which is humane and intelligent, and which will enable sustainable development to be achieved.
I hope that that is what we shall see on 3 December.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, what has happened with Sabena in my country is very tragic, and I am pleased that the Belgian Government is making a huge effort to try to cushion the direct and indirect social effects.
Needless to say, that is never entirely possible with a bankruptcy of this scale, but it is important nevertheless that an effort is also being made indirectly, in the area of training and in-service training.
I should also like to ask the Commissioner to advise soon whether something will also be done at European level, what the amounts will be that are involved and what kind of efforts will be made in respect of various airline companies.
Sabena is, of course, a spectacular case, but social tragedies are also unfolding in other airline companies.
That is where a European approach and European support are needed, so that people know that Europe is doing something, for my fellow MEP quite rightly pointed out that at the moment we have a one-sided image of Europe which, in my view, should be rectified.
One thing is clear to me.
In my opinion, the role of the Member States and of an individual approach to aviation per Member State is over.
We have been saying this for years, even if some people in this Parliament still believe that a national approach must be maintained.
That era should finally come to an end, in my view.
We must opt for a European approach.
National state aid to airline companies makes no sense whatsoever.
We must decide very quickly on whether - and I share your view in this, Mr Simpson - European aid to a European sector is possible and on the conditions under which that can be done.
However, I do not think the problem is solved by saying: OK, they put USD 5 billion on the table, we will put EUR 5 billion on the table.
In my view, the problem will not be solved in that way, for this financial solution must be accompanied by a simultaneous restructuring scheme.
There was no point in getting the Belgian Government, or possibly the European Government, to bail out Sabena once again and to keep it in the air.
Sabena had to restructure and do something, which happened in too painful a manner.
They have waited for too long to do this rationally.
Instead, it is now happening in a chaotic manner.
That is unfortunate, but I believe we should learn from this.
The fact that Sabena is the first national airline company to go bankrupt in the Union speaks volumes.
We tend to hold on to national airline companies, and those days are over, as various MEPs have stated today.
We must adopt a European approach.
That implies air traffic control, security measures and agreements with third countries.
Mrs Durant, I am pleased that you are offering a window in this respect, but I hope that you can convince all your colleagues, for that is exactly what the opposition in the Council was about.
Member States are reluctant to relinquish this authority, and refuse to join forces at European level, and we are now paying the price for this. the Americans are able to adopt a joint policy, but we are not.
You are not represented at international level when aviation is at issue.
It is the fifteen Member States that conclude agreements with open skies etc. and that compete with each other politically.
I hope, therefore, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that you will be able to convince your colleagues.
And I hope that everyone here in this Parliament is convinced of the fact that we must at long last respond at European, rather than national, level.
Mr President, I actually believe that, faced with the recession in the aviation industry and in air transport, we need some strong decisions in order to restore confidence and open up real prospects.
I personally am not satisfied with the Commission' s response, which favours the speeding up of restructuring in the air transport sector.
I am in favour of a European approach. We can discuss and comment on the content of that approach later.
As for restoring confidence, I believe that confidence is actually a product of safety, and the safety dimension in this sector, as in others, is dependent upon the expertise, competence and qualifications of the staff employed.
Commissioner, I am absolutely in agreement with you on the urgent need to develop the social dialogue, but we cannot just be content with a social dialogue at a time when people are facing the problem of redundancies.
Is anyone really listening to the employees concerned?
They too have comments, and thoughts, and proposals, and in view of what we have just decided regarding the consultation of workers, perhaps that could be implemented much more rapidly.
I also believe that restoring confidence involves learning lessons from the present crisis and putting a stop to the process of liberalisation that is currently underway.
Frankly, I do not believe that the liberalisation that has developed in this sector has contributed towards its development. In fact I would rather say that it has contributed towards its difficulties.
Restoring confidence also means, at any given moment, taking responsibility for providing assistance.
I believe that the limited targeted measures are insufficient to cope with this crisis.
Since the American aid is considerable, I believe that there should be compensatory aid in the air transport sector, but that it should also be made conditional upon maintaining jobs.
Finally, I believe that we also need to open up prospects.
It seems to me that among our long-term prospects we should be looking at how the European Union can work, not towards concentrations, but towards the development of international cooperation, on safety and the management of air traffic, between the airlines and the public authorities.
Mr President, I believe that we should also increase cooperation between air and rail transport, and that airports should be integrated into the trans-European networks.
Mr President, the terrorist attacks in September have disrupted the operations of many airline companies in Europe, resulting in job losses in the aviation industry and a reduction in the number of overseas tourists coming to Europe.
We want to ensure that we retain competitive airline companies in Europe.
I agree with the key proposals included in the compromise resolutions that are before us today.
It is important that the Commission works out a set of proposals which make it possible for the European airline industry to withstand the competition resulting from the massive help which the American Government is giving American airlines at this time.
We must ensure that the European aviation industry receives equal treatment vis-à-vis our American airline counterparts, particularly when it comes to addressing transatlantic arrangements.
For example, from an Irish perspective, Aer Lingus is highly dependent on transatlantic travel.
Other EU airlines also make a substantial profit from their transatlantic routes.
It is important that these EU airlines can compete against the American airlines which have received state aid from the American Government in recent times.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should like to comment on just two aspects, socially acceptable and economically reasonable restructuring in the aviation industry.
Madam President-in-Office, you were too generous in your comments just now when you said that the Council had in fact responded consistently.
I have my doubts about this, Madam President-in-Office, and I should like to urge you in the strongest possible terms to ensure that the same subsidies - whether it be for insurance cover, whether it be compensation, or whether it be possible restructuring aid - are granted or not granted in all of the Member States.
It is not acceptable for airlines to be supported in a particular way in one Member State and not in another when all are supposed to be competing fairly in an internal market.
This cannot work.
We want to establish fair terms of competition between the airlines.
As President-in-Office of the Council you must ensure that this is the case and you, Commissioner, must, if necessary, take the Member States to court if there are distortions of competition here which destroy the internal market.
Secondly, Madam President-in-Office, you rightly referred to the fact that restructuring is necessary.
Probably there will be a number of larger global players and some regional airlines.
They cannot be bound to Member State A or Member State B. We need a functioning European and global air transport market.
This can only happen, Madam President-in-Office, if the Member States cede their responsibilities for take-off and landing rights to the Community and if we administer the take-off and landing rights together.
Only then can we give our airlines a chance to compete on fair terms in the global market.
I would earnestly request that in the next few weeks you do all you can to bring your influence to bear on your Member States on these two points.
Mr President, in making our decisions on the aviation industry in Europe we have to take account of the interconnectedness of our economies and politics in Europe and globally as well.
The fact is that Aer Lingus in Ireland had already been hit by the downturn in the high-tech industries where much of the lucrative business travel for Aer Lingus had already been badly hit because businessmen and women were simply not travelling back and forth across the Atlantic.
Clearly, 11 September virtually wiped out that business.
Tourism is also a major linchpin in the economy of Ireland.
Our airline is an important asset in that area of the industry.
If we allow that to go down the drain, who is going to service the Irish tourist economy?
The Council and the Commission are, I am afraid, confused.
They are minimalist and grudging in their response to this crisis for the Irish airline.
That is perceived to be so by the workers of Aer Lingus and the Irish people in general.
We will pay the price in Europe for that perception.
It is important that we recognise that the national carrier in every Member State in Europe is as important as the national anthem or the national flag.
You can shake your head, but that is the reality.
We have to take that into account.
We may regret it, but we must take it into account in dealing with this crisis.
Finally, there are four things I would ask the Commission and the Council to address.
There is an urgent need for a reply to the Irish Government's request to the Commission for permission to assist the Irish airline with the compensation that is due as a result of 11 September.
There is an urgent need for the reform of the competition rules.
There is an urgent need for assistance to help companies create alliances at a European level, which will ensure that the national carriers are not annihilated.
Finally, we need firm proposals for the social fund package that has been talked about here today.
Parliament should be discussing those proposals when we next meet in Strasbourg in December, not next June.
Mr President, the fact of the matter is that, even in the air transport industry, the law of the jungle and the savage neo-liberal policy which applies are such that mergers have taken place and national airlines which enjoyed periods of strong growth in the past have gone bankrupt, a blatant example being the bankruptcy of Swissair and Sabena.
And no doubt others will follow.
In the medium term at least, two or three large airlines will survive in Europe to share the pickings with the American behemoths which, with the connivance of our governments, have taken pains to penetrate and take over the European market.
The terrorist attacks on 11 September have intensified the crisis and been used as an excuse for cutbacks and mass redundancies.
And in what is already a dismal situation for many national carriers, along comes the Commission to administer the coup de grace by prohibiting state aid, at a time when the US government is injecting its behemoths with massive amounts in aid.
There can be no doubt that this situation is here to stay and, the more capital is concentrated, the more the workers and consumers will be expected to pick up the tab in the form of job losses and more and more expensive tickets.
That is why the only solution is to support the fight to get this policy reversed and get rid of those who apply it.
Mr President, we have to restore public confidence in aviation and we have to let the market decide what happens to the airlines themselves.
Restoring public confidence means getting security screening right and improving the quality of staff, training, job procedures, pay and conditions.
It means, perhaps, ensuring that there is a state-run security operation at airports and paying accordingly.
That may well create more jobs.
So far as the airlines and their financial viability are concerned, we do not want more intervention, more bureaucracy and more delay.
We need targeted assistance in areas like insurance and the cost of security.
We must let the market decide what the future of the airline industry shall be.
As was said earlier, Sabena made a profit in only one year out of the many years that it has been in existence.
Aer Lingus, Alitalia, Air France and KLM are not far behind.
Why the devil should we support Aer Lingus when Ryanair can make money without any difficulties at all - like Easyjet, like GO, like Buzz?
All those airlines can make money at a difficult time.
Why should we therefore bail out the Sabenas and the Aer Linguses with their overcapacity, with too many routes, too few passengers and too much state pride?
I have two specific questions that I wish to ask the President-in-Office of the Council.
Firstly, I am led to believe that there are problems with the Sabena slots that have been offered, in Britain, for example, to British Midland and British European Airways.
They may have them for a short time but there is some suggestion from the coordinator that they may be lost in six months time if DAT is reformed and wants those slots back.
That is unacceptable.
If Sabena cannot fill those slots then others should be allowed to use them.
Secondly, what is being done to ensure that the staff at Brussels airport does not restrict the movement of those new-slot airlines as a result of picketing and delays at the airport?
We need guarantees of freedom of movement on the ground as well as in the air.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it would be a shame if, at this difficult time, the European institutions were to fall into the trap of being both overzealous and too market-oriented at the same time.
On the one hand, in the name of what is in this case totally blinkered liberalisation, they require full adherence to the State aid system, which prevents any action being taken to support airlines. On the other hand, there is a genuine danger that we will find ourselves - there have already been 30 000 job losses within the space of 30 days - with 100 000 jobs being lost in 100 days, in a sector which, moreover, enjoys little in the way of social protection.
For two months, we have been saying that 11 September changed the world and the balance of society.
It would be a shame if we were to miss the political significance of this and fail to review the order of our priorities.
In European integration based on social cohesion, in a Europe built on the fundamental principle of work, what priority should we today give to the risk of an uncontrolled wave of unemployment?
Do we still think we can prevent the inevitable market crisis?
We are all aware that this crisis has roots in the past, that it is more than just a consequence of the events of 11 September, that it is also the result of excessive market fragmentation.
However, we do not feel that going to the opposite extreme - bringing about a huge merger which would ultimately only save three national airlines: the French, British and German companies - would be a healthy solution.
We are actually not so very far off this situation, considering what happened to Sabena and the engineered drop in the nominal value of the shares of a large number of airlines which are in danger of selling at a loss. A prime example is Alitalia.
Lastly, Mr President, I welcome the code of conduct for US airlines intended to avoid piracy in the market, provided that, as others have said, the European governments do genuinely intend to enforce it, for otherwise it will be just another list of unfulfilled good intentions.
Mr President, the International Transport Agency anticipates that a total of 200 000 people will lose their jobs in the airline industry worldwide in the wake of the attacks.
This organisation also expects that the total losses incurred in this industry will amount to 7 billion this year, and that it will take twelve months before the industry will recover.
That is what we are facing here: a worldwide crisis which has major ramifications for Europe.
That is point one.
Point two - and this has already been mentioned by a number of speakers - is that this industry had been in a very bad way for a long time.
I often have to take the floor when we deal with enormous job losses, and it is always a sad occasion.
This time is no exception.
However, there is something peculiar about it this time round.
Part of the guilty party is sitting directly opposite me, namely the Council itself.
We ask in our resolution for a European airline industry and a European airline policy.
What the Council has offered us is a policy of national carriers where everyone acts in their own self-interest and everyone wants to conclude their own agreements with the United States.
Mr De Rossa said that the national carrier is as sacred as the national anthem.
If that is the attitude, then we will never solve the problem, of course.
If we all act in our own self-interest, we will be unable to reach a European solution.
We will then end up in a frosty restructuring programme, which is exactly what is now threatening to happen.
I think we are all agreed that that should not happen, but we must get the idea out of our heads that we can still have national carriers in this internal market.
It is impossible to pursue sound social policy if the economic backdrop is in total disarray, and as far as that is concerned, the Council is innocent in all of this.
The Commission has made a very good effort.
There are many proposals before us, but these have all been rejected by the Council.
The first thing the Council should allow the Commission to do is to talk with the United States on its own.
If that is not done, other things should not be discussed either.
Mr President, the tragic events of 11 September have certainly changed the face of the aviation industry and will probably have more effects in the months to come.
Today I want to deal with the effect they are having on the regional areas of Europe, rather than the major cities like London, Birmingham and Paris, because they will survive and receive support.
We in Northern Ireland watched with interest as Sabena pulled out, and then Aer Lingus, which provided a service from Belfast to Shannon for transatlantic flights and was used by many people in Northern Ireland.
The Republic of Ireland's Government said it wanted greater cooperation with Northern Ireland, but the first time there is a bit of trouble, it runs away!
That is the kind of cooperation we Unionists have to put up with!
No one can persuade me that some of these large companies have not used this situation to put some of their own problems right.
British Airways stayed in Northern Ireland and stood by its staff through bombs and bullets.
What has it done?
It has pulled out of Northern Ireland as well!
I condemn it for that.
I hope, Commissioner, that you will ensure that it is not allowed to keep those slots in order to open up more lucrative routes and that if other companies are prepared to start up from the regions those slots will be given to them.
I certainly feel very strongly about this.
I am not in favour of giving large amounts of money to bail out inefficient companies.
To some extent Mr Atkins is right: there are other companies out there which are making money and they have to be supported.
I say to the Commission and the Council that they cannot come here and give us a lecture.
They will have to come back with firm and positive proposals.
It is time for action and time for a dose of realism.
If the Council and the Commission cannot do it now, we will harry them until they do!
Mr President, briefly, on the subject of the discussion that we have just heard, I do not believe that anyone here, either the Council, or the Commission, or any one of us, has exclusive rights to indignation in the face of the social problems that are occurring now for each of these airlines, and perhaps for some of them more than others.
I am particularly well-placed to know all about that.
I believe that this social crisis that is being experienced by a certain number of those who operate and work in the air transport sector is obviously a challenge to all of us.
However, I also believe that, despite this challenge and the need to react to this problem, to follow the road that we took in the past, via massive state aid, would be to avoid or conceal a situation which was already in existence before 11 September.
This is a fragile sector, in which the profit margins have been extremely low in recent years.
Therefore, despite the indignation that we all feel in the face of the current social problem, I believe that to imagine that simply returning to massive structural aid will solve the problems in this sector would be to evade an obstacle which will confront us again later, in an even more dramatic form.
I really believe, on behalf of the Council, even though this debate has only just started in the Council, that it will not be easy, and what you have said today demonstrates that.
We well know how much Member States are attached to their national airlines and how important that attachment is, and here I am speaking more on my own account than on behalf of the Council, where we shall soon have to start these discussions.
We have made an immediate start by giving immediate and specific responses in this sector.
Yes, there is aid in various forms.
There are specific and targeted forms of aid with regard to the closure of airspace, and the possibility of providing even more, on the basis of objective criteria.
There has been aid in connection with insurance facilities.
There are other types of aid, not financial aid, regarding the problem of time slots, so as to enable the airlines to keep their heads above water, or at least not to sink any deeper.
There have been responses.
I also believe that what we have done regarding the matter of security is an immediate response concerning those elements which will restore passengers' confidence in the safety and security aspects, which are obviously so essential if the public is to regain confidence.
I therefore believe that the responses which have been given by the Council and the Commission are immediate responses.
It is true that the social crises which we are experiencing in various European airlines, and particularly in Belgium, and which also call for social responses involving taking these problems into consideration, should not cover up the urgent need to begin a debate, within the Council, on a more structural consolidation of the sector.
This is without a doubt the only way of giving to this sector, in structural terms, not only the social responses which it needs, but also economic responses, and responses which will guarantee its long-term survival, not forgetting - as some of you have mentioned - the need for multi-mode transport systems, the need to place air transport too in the context of short-distance journeys at European level, the development of the high-speed train and any other alternatives which will enable us, in that context too, to provide responses at the level of a common transport policy.
However, I really believe that a return to massive state aid would be a step in the wrong direction, a step backwards, and a step which would, above all, risk leading us, at a later date, into even more serious difficulties.
By contrast, we have provided specific responses, and there are other responses to come: the security regulation, which I hope we shall be able to agree on on 7 December.
I also hope that it will be possible for Parliament to contribute its views on this subject to the debate as well.
There is still an enormous amount of work to do, but I really think that the time has come to begin these discussions on structural consolidation, in addition to the specific responses which have already been provided and which were necessary in the very short term.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I have received six motions for resolution pursuant to Rule 37 (2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Combating social exclusion
The next item is the report (A5-0372/2001), by Mrs Figueiredo, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Decision establishing a programme of Community action to encourage cooperation between the Member States to combat social exclusion [C5-0439/2001 - 2000/0157(COD)].
Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as is well-known, and as the recent Commission report on social inclusion confirms, poverty remains at excessively high levels.
Although the latest available data on incomes in the Member States does not capture the whole complexity and multi-faceted nature of the scale of poverty and social exclusion, it does show that in 1997, around 18% of the population of European Union, in other words, more than 60 million people, lived in homes in which the income was less than 60% of the average national income and that around half of these 60 million people had lived below the relative poverty threshold for three consecutive years.
This situation shows how crucial it is that we implement a global strategy for combating poverty and social exclusion, defending human rights in all their aspects, and that this programme is an instrument that must be implemented urgently.
One year ago, in this House, we approved at first reading the report on this Community programme of providing incentives for cooperation between Member States in the fight against social exclusion as an important aspect of the strategy to combat poverty which the Council spoke of so much at the Lisbon summit in March of 2000.
At the same time, however, the Member States have given new commitments, with the definition, in Nice, of the objectives of the fight against poverty, and in Stockholm, where they committed themselves to promoting sustainable development and quality jobs, confirming their desire to thereby contribute to reducing the risk of poverty and social exclusion.
National plans for social inclusion were also drawn up, identifying a set of factors that considerably increase the risk of poverty and social exclusion, such as unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, low income, low-quality employment, lack of proper housing, unstable health, immigration, early school-leaving, gender inequality, discrimination and racism, disability, old age, family breakdown, drug addiction and alcoholism, and living in a highly disadvantaged area.
Sometimes, these risk factors interact and combine over time, and it is therefore necessary to break the recurring cycle of poverty and to prevent intergenerational poverty and new forms of poverty, including info-exclusion.
It is in this context that the programme becomes especially significant, as yet another instrument with which to fight poverty and social exclusion, which as we see, is continuing to increase.
Lastly, after overcoming the Council' s intransigence on aspects that Parliament has always considered to be essential, specifically with regard to the programme' s budget, the participation of NGOs and financial support for them, the role of the European Parliament and the promotion of innovative approaches, we have reached the end of a long process that includes a second reading on 17 May this year, various working meetings with the Belgian presidency and conciliation, in which, finally, consensus was reached on 18 September.
With regard to the agreement that has been reached, it is important to mention the aspects dealing with the budget and its increase by EUR 5 million to EUR 75 million for the five years of the programme, which is still insufficient, but, given the Council' s intransigence, not reaching an agreement would have meant the programme not coming into force at the beginning of next year.
A decision was also reached on promoting innovative approaches and financial support for actions undertaken by NGOs, which has increased from 80% to 90% in exceptional circumstances.
It is also worth noting that agreement was reached on the participation of NGOs, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, in preparing and holding the annual Round table on the situation' s development and the programme' s implementation.
It is also important to point out that the role of the European Parliament has been acknowledged, specifically in the timely consideration of the synthesis report for the Spring Council, which the Commission will draw up annually and which will examine the overall coherence of policies with social cohesion, including the progress made under this programme.
Lastly, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank everyone who has taken part and contributed to this proposal' s success and for the consensus reached in the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament.
Mr President, may I express my political group's satisfaction with the fact that, for the first time at European level, we are now ready to apply a Community strategy to combat social exclusion.
We have urgent challenges to meet.
Not only is it unacceptable for so many million citizens in the European Union and candidate countries to be living below the poverty line, but the knowledge society which we are creating and the increasingly multicultural society in which we live in Europe harbour new risks of social exclusion.
What is important is that this social programme will give us the chance to process our policies on the basis of modern scientific data, on the basis of statistical studies and on the basis of exchanges of best practices, including with countries outside the European Union, such as those in the European Economic Area.
This is particularly important for Member States unused to applying strategies based on social research, the very countries which now face the most serious social problems.
The European Parliament, as the rapporteur, Mrs Figueiredo has just said, had high hopes of this Community programme.
Nevertheless, it supports the joint text brokered during conciliation with the Council and is satisfied with the constructive part played by the European Commission.
The rapporteur has already listed the main points of this conciliation.
We particularly wanted to highlight the innovative approach which the European Commission has promised to promote in order to ensure that citizens with special difficulties are integrated into society.
The ground which we need to cover between now and 2010, the timeframe and political milestone set in Lisbon, will be a long, hard haul and it is crucial, in our view, that the European Council in Laeken set its stamp very firmly on this effort.
We have special need of such decisiveness at this time when, as the previous debate highlighted, we are feeling the economic and social fallout from the crisis provoked by 11 September more and more acutely in Europe; at the same time, the Member States need to move into action by instigating public dialogue and integrating the fight against social exclusion into all their policies.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs had quite a struggle over this issue of combating social exclusion.
I should like to point out that it was more or less unanimous throughout the procedure, and was served by an excellent rapporteur.
However, conciliation, which we had thought would be easy, since we were so much in accord with the Council' s motives when it adopted the Commission' s proposal, proved surprisingly tough and difficult.
I should therefore like to remind the House, briefly, of the reasons for our insistence.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and, I am sure, Parliament as a whole, approves the choice of the open-cooperation method. It has proved its worth in this area.
We also agree that social exclusion is a complex and multi-facetted process, and that it is necessary to study it in greater depth, particularly as regards its links with poverty.
There are people on the margins of society who are not poor, and not all poor people are excluded, but the area of overlapping is a very large one.
It is not possible to separate the two problems.
However, one of the major strengths of the open-cooperation method is the fact that it allows the exchange of good practice.
It is here that Europe has a responsibility, or I would prefer to say a duty, to experiment and to lead by example.
The information already collected enables us to launch innovative schemes and pilot projects with confidence.
In addition, Commissioner, you are a politician, as we are.
How could you imagine for a moment that we could sell to our voters the idea that, on a problem as serious and as evident as social exclusion, Europe is able only to finance studies, and is not able to take any practical action?
This sort of thing is suicidal as far as Europe' s image is concerned, hence the innovatory approaches that you have finally conceded to us.
Fortunately you have other mechanisms, we know, but given the importance of this preoccupation it was necessary to include it.
The controversy over the budget arises from this. You have granted us only five million.
Since we know that you had plans ready for carrying out these studies, we would like to have a guarantee that there will be money available for innovative experiments.
In the same way, the NGOs must be able to work without having to look for unlikely external sponsors.
Well, we have achieved this, and the text has been improved.
I wish the Commission all the best in carrying out the task that lies before it.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her serious and very committed work on this issue and also the work that our own committee has done, as Mr Rocard has just pointed out.
This action programme is a very serious and important step forward for the European Union.
It is part of the recognition of the huge problem of social exclusion which is not only the result of poverty, although it is of course linked to it.
Some of those links are picked up in the excellent report by Mrs Lynne which we will be debating later, concerning the European Year of Disabled People, and in Mr Nobilia's report which recognises the problems faced by elderly or disabled people in exercising, for example, their freedom of movement because disability benefits are not included in the coordination of social security systems.
In our discussions on this action programme, Parliament has insisted on the need for civil society to be involved in the programme itself and its evaluation.
This involvement is critical.
It is clear that the top-down policies, and the hope that overall economic growth would somehow overcome the poverty and lift the poorest out of that state, have not worked.
It is the constructive involvement of the people themselves that is part of the solution.
We therefore expect that the research and programmes funded with this modestly increased amount of money, a limited range as Mr Rocard has just said, will not just concentrate on policy but also on the process of policy formulation and funding decisions, which in itself could be an innovative dimension.
I recently attended a local government conference looking at the national social inclusion plans.
Speakers representing organisations from groups which often experience social exclusion - poor people, those with disabilities, those from minority ethnic groups etc. were asked whether they would rather see the implementation of a few policies that have worked elsewhere or have a full programme of real consultation, even if they did not then get what they wanted.
The answer, without exception, was that they wanted to be consulted because that implied respect for their experience and their opinions.
It is also my hope that the activities funded under this programme will not just concentrate on work as the answer to exclusion.
It is not a solution if the work is poorly paid and exploitative.
I, like many others, look forward to reading and evaluating the results of this programme and hope that they will make real progress in tackling social exclusion.
Mr President, like Mrs Figueiredo, we also welcome this action plan against social exclusion.
We think that certain things have been achieved - as always, in conciliation processes not everything we want is achieved - and, although the budget is still low, the budget for NGOs has been raised and the role that the European Parliament plays is very important.
I think that there is some fine wording in this document: I would remind you of Article 2 - which asks for a high level of employment and a fight against poverty - and point out that the Council considers the current levels of poverty that still exist in the European Union to be unacceptable. However, we are running the risk that applying this action plan - whose implementation next year is welcomed by all of us - will be like putting a small sticking plaster onto a large gaping wound.
In the previous debate we talked about the virtues of the market in terms of sustaining airlines, yet we talk less of the 12 000 jobs at Sabena.
We run the risk of losing much blood whilst we try to stem its flow with a small sticking plaster.
Nevertheless, Mr President, this plan against social exclusion is very welcome.
Mr President, I should like to warmly welcome the final outcome of the conciliation procedure and make a point of congratulating Mrs Figueiredo who, thanks to her meticulous work and by working with all sides, managed in the end to give us this tool much more quickly than we anticipated.
Mr President, the speakers referred - and this is important - to the shortcomings and limited potential of this tool as it stands.
However, we have to start from the fact that we are talking about a policy area which does not come under European jurisdiction.
We have no jurisdiction to exercise policy but, for the first time, the Member States have decided to work together.
So, within the framework of this joint decision to work together, three things have happened.
First, national action plans against exclusion and poverty are being submitted, for the first time.
Secondly, the Social Protection Committee and the European Commission are working together to find a joint policy framework, again for the first time.
May I remind you that we do not even have a common definition of the word "poverty" in the European Union.
Thirdly, we have the programme, which is a first tool, but an important tool nevertheless.
What is important is that, first, the budget has been increased as a result of significant pressure and intervention on the part of the European Parliament and, secondly, we have achieved a common position between the Commission and Parliament during conciliation on 90% funding for organisations which really do not have any resources of their own.
So what does this tool do?
I can sum up the basic elements of this tool in seven points. One, it supports and helps the structures in the Member States to collate data and analyse and research the situation in all the Member States.
Two, it helps us work together and develop joint social indicators, for the first time.
Three, it supports the procedures used to monitor and implement national action plan programmes on employment.
Four, it supports the exchange of best practices and programmes.
Five, it involves all the agencies, local authorities, non-governmental organisations, governments, foundations and universities.
Six - and I should like to highlight this point - it specifically involves associations of people who are the victims of poverty and exclusion and, seven, it allows us to raise public awareness of the huge problem of poverty, which cannot be dealt with simply by governments and European programmes but which needs to galvanise the whole of society into action.
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Announcement by the President
First of all, ladies and gentlemen, I have some information which I would advise you, if I may, to listen to.
In view of the fact that the World Trade Organization meeting in Qatar lasted longer than expected, Mr Lamy and Mr Fischler will not be able to attend our sitting this afternoon.
I therefore propose that we should continue our debates between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m., while we should stick to the planned timetable for topical and urgent subjects of major importance, and of course for the vote.
Madam President, when will my report be debated - the Lynne report on the European Year of People with Disabilities, 2003?
Will that now be at around 3.30 p.m.?
We have a sign language interpreter arriving now for the debate at 5.30 p.m. because everything has been changed around so much that we do not know when this report is being debated.
I have deaf members of the public attending and we have the sign language interpreter.
So can we please stick to some sort of timetable?
Mrs Lynne, you were quite right to bring this information to my attention.
I think that we can at least leave your report at the time that was originally planned for it, in other words at 5.30 p.m.
Mr President, we understand the reasons why Commissioners Lamy and Fischler cannot be with us this afternoon.
Could you confirm, however, that there will be an opportunity for those two commissioners to report to us on the important negotiations at Doha and whether the EU's views were accepted or not.
Of course, Mrs McNally, we shall certainly be holding this debate with the Commission in December, but we cannot really blame the commissioners in question for not being able to come back any earlier.
Madam President, I wish to say a few brief words, just to clarify something.
I was not able to take part in yesterday' s vote on the Caudron report, and consequently did not spot a mistake that I would like to point out to my fellow Members.
As a result of a mistake by Parliament staff, a proposal for an amendment - No 20 - that we had tabled to the Caudron report on the research programme was mistakenly included in the Euratom report.
I do not intend to dwell on this subject, because other amendments by other Members have addressed the same issue. I do wish to make this observation, however, because people were probably surprised that the insertion of the amendment made no sense at all in the context of Euratom.
Mr Ribeiro e Castro, we are happy to take note of what you have said, and we shall see that the necessary correction is made.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I was in the Members' Bar before we started voting.
I saw a piece of baggage on a chair.
For approximately 15 minutes nobody came for it. A man approached and I asked him whether it was his bag.
I told him that, in view of the security situation, it was advisable to stay with one's baggage and that, in addition, to be in the Members' Bar you had to be invited by a Member.
He was extremely arrogant and annoyed. He took his bag and marched away.
He said that he knew Mrs Muscardini.
She then arrived in the bar; I asked her that if she knew the gentlemen, and said that due to the security problems, I had informed him politely of the situation.
I should like to say to this House that we as Members of this Parliament also have a responsibility.
We have been asking for security measures to be stepped up and we all, therefore, must take responsibility for the people we bring here or allow here in our name.
I would just ask you, Madam President, to remind the House of our responsibilities for future security.
I congratulate you, Mrs Foster, on your vigilance. You acted very properly in the circumstances.
Vote
Madam President, I should like to make it clear to my fellow MEPs that, if Amendment No 9, tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, is adopted, the issue will be sent back to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
That will be the correct method of proceeding, for it will give us more time to investigate the legal consequences of this proposal.
I received an answer from the Council yesterday, stating that it did not want to express an opinion on the proposal' s legal validity as long as the proposal was being debated in the Council.
I simply believe it would be wrong for us to proceed to a vote here in Parliament before such a legal evaluation has been made available to us.
I find the Council' s answer totally unacceptable.
I would ask my fellow MEPs to support Amendment No 9 so that we can obtain a new reading in the committee.

Madam President, may I say to both you and the Commission that I believe that Rule 68 of the Rules of Procedure applies here, meaning that you have to give the Commissioner the floor in order to ask if the Commission intends to withdraw its proposal.
That is the first step.
I agree, and this is why I was giving the floor to the Commission.
Thank you, Mr Katiforis. I believe Mr Bolkestein wishes to speak.
Madam President, I understand that the report by Mr Katiforis has been accepted.
That means that the Commission proposal is rejected.
I would like to say first of all that the Commission very much regrets this vote, in particular because the Commission's proposal is precisely what Parliament asked for in 1996.
This is an unusual situation.
Parliament asks something of the Commission.
The Commission does what is asked of it and Parliament rejects what the Commission has done.
However I shall apprise the Commission of this regrettable result next week when the Commission next meets, and I shall confer with my colleagues and with President Prodi on the course of action to be taken now in connection with the rules of the Treaty which are perfectly clear.
(Applause)
Madam President, I should only like to comment on this point very briefly.
Firstly, the Commission proposal was flawed, but what is even more important, Commissioner, is the fact that elections have been held in the meantime, and the Commission should also take note of this.
We really cannot spend any more time on this matter.
Madam President, of course it is also a pity that the Council tried to pre-empt Parliament's opinion with a political agreement and did not have the courtesy to let Parliament express its views first.
That by way of a brief reply to what Mr Bolkestein just said.
But may I say that, pursuant to Rule 68 of the Rules of Procedure, Mr Bolkestein's answer is incomplete.
The Rule is clear.
We ask the Commission if it intends to withdraw its proposal.
Mr Bolkestein has not said if it intends to do so.
He said that he would confer with his colleagues on the course of action to be taken now, from which I conclude that the Commission refuses to withdraw its proposal.
Consequently, we need to proceed to the third paragraph of the Rule, which states that the matter has to be referred back to the committee responsible, without voting on the draft legislative resolution and I propose that we do precisely that.
I quite agree, Mr Katiforis. This is the view we should take of the matter.
Madam President, Mr Katiforis is quite correct, but if the precedent in this House, is anything to go by, now that Parliament has made a proposal, in five years' time the Commission will come forward with an idea which we will reject again.
(Parliament decided to refer the matter back to the committee responsible)
Report (A5-0395/2001) by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation aiming to promote the conversion of vessels and of fishermen that were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco [COM(2001) 384 - C5-0407/2001 - 2001/0163(CNS)]
Before the vote
chairman of the Committee on Budgets. Madam President, it would be an oral amendment, which would be a new Recital 12.
It would also apply to the draft legislative resolution and would read: "The proposal was not foreseen in the financial perspective.
The financial envelope of the proposal should be covered by additional resources."
Madam President, as rapporteur of this report I would like to make two points: firstly, that this very amendment tabled orally by my fellow Member Mr Wynn has been rejected at the vote by the Committee on Fisheries on the day my own report was voted upon.
The second is that I do not oppose this amendment being tabled and it should be this House that decides upon its content.
Madam President, is it clear that the vote is only on the legislative part of the proposal and not on the budgetary part?
We shall discuss the oral amendment that Mr Wynn has just mentioned, which does, of course, have financial implications. I am sure that everyone understands this.
Madam President, with regard to the amendment tabled by the Chairperson of the Committee on Budgets, I support the proposal made by our rapporteur and, also, in agreement with what the Commission said, I would like to say that we have always spoken about this proposal from the point of view of fisheries and we do not involve ourselves with the budgetary aspects.
However, although what Mr Wynn proposes is true - that, as is stated here, the proposal was not included in the financial perspectives - it is nonetheless certain, and for this reason the House must also be provided with this information, that the Commission has requested the use of the flexibility instrument, providing this proposal, in due time, with EUR 197 million.
Therefore, we are in favour of this proposal from the Committee on Budgets, but we would remind our fellow Members in this committee, and the Council, that they should come to an agreement with regard to the use of this instrument and provide the proposal with this EUR 197 million, which is necessary so that fishermen and the families affected can resolve this problem.
(The President noted that there was no opposition to considering the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0384/2001) by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the approximation of the civil and commercial law of the Member States [COM(2001) 398 - C5-0471/2001 - 2001/2187(COS)]
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0363/2001) by Mr Chichester, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Commission Green Paper Towards a European strategy for the security of energy supply (COM(2000) 769 - C5-0145/2001 - 2001/2071(COS))
Before the vote
Madam President, I have noticed that there are not just a few minor linguistic errors.
Entire paragraphs of the text are different.
It looks like the translator has translated a different text.
Please could this be checked. And I should like to take this opportunity to say that errors have crept into Greek translations on other occasions.
If you spoke Greek you would understand what I am about to say.
In one section, the words tuberculosis and malaria have simply been transliterated into Greek instead of using the Greek terms.
I am very sorry, Mr Alyssandrakis.
I can only attempt to ensure that the versions in the various languages are properly monitored and checked.
I am told that this will be done and not only for the Greek version, because other versions are also affected by these mistakes.
We shall, therefore, ensure that everything is put right.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0356/2001) by Mrs Schörling, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission White Paper on Strategy for a future Chemicals Policy [COM(2001) 88 - C5-0258/2001 - 2001/2118(COS)]
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Madam President, I should like to ask you to look into what this vote has cost European taxpayers.
I should also like you to make money available for a course through which the committee can learn to work together.
It is quite outrageous that we should sit for an hour voting on what should have been resolved by the committee.
They really must get their bloody act together before long.
This endless piddling about cannot continue!
Mr Blak, I think that from now on, we should count the cost of all votes.
Report (A5-0341/2001) by Mrs Flemming, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the Commission communication to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee on pricing policies for enhancing the sustainability of water resources [COM(2000) 477 - C5-0634/2000 - 2000/2298(COS)]
Before the vote on the entire motion for a resolution
.
(DE) Madam President, I deeply regret the fact that I must now recommend to my group that it reject my own report in the final vote, because I, like my group, really do not think that it is fair for a national problem to be brought before the European Parliament.
(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)
Madam President, I just wanted to follow up the previous point of order and ask when are we going to be able to debate the proposals in Mr Corbett's report - which I understand are stuck in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs - so that this ludicrous procedure, with six pages of plenary amendments on one report, can be reformed.
We will be a laughing stock if we do not reform and get our House in order.
Report (A5-0323/2001) by Mrs Corbey, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on implementation of Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste 2000/2319(INI)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0336/2001) by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on a global partnership and a common strategy for relations between the European Union and Latin America [2000/2249(INI)]
Before the vote
Madam President, I should like to say that it states on the agenda that voting will be from 12 noon until 1 p.m. and that it will resume at 6.30 p.m.
I really do think that we ought to keep to the agenda.
I must point out, ladies and gentlemen, that yesterday, we exceeded the time allocated and that consequently, Mr Posselt' s comment would have applied yesterday too.
I shall, therefore, consult the House: who wishes to continue?
(The House decided to continue voting)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Motion for a resolution (B5-0704/2001), by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy, on arbitrary arrests and the political situation in Laos.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution on negotiations within the framework of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention following the recent anthrax attacks
Before the vote on paragraph 2
Given the uncertainty about the precise position of the President of the United States, I propose correcting the second part of paragraph 2 to say "including the search for effective procedures" instead of "the establishment of existing procedures" .
Madam President, there is a short oral amendment which has been agreed by all signatories of this compromise resolution and reads as follows: in paragraph 2, after the word 'terrorism' , a new sentence saying: 'Demands that national governments assume responsibility for additional security costs.'
If there are no objections to this oral amendment, the motion for a resolution I am putting to the vote will include the oral amendment that Mrs Foster has just explained.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Madam President, you have presided over 358 separate votes just now.
I hope colleagues will agree that this underlines the need to reform our Rules of Procedure.
Madam President, I gather from the display that the next report is the Bouwman report.
Does that mean that there is not going to be a debate on the WTO?
That debate will take place in December, Mr Rübig, because, as I said, Mr Lamy and Mr Fischler will not be able to join us in time.
). I am afraid I cannot agree with Mr Corbett's point about the votes in this plenary.
There are many committees in this Parliament, which do not have representation from every Member State.
Therefore we will find those people will be disenfranchised and that is becoming a greater problem as the European Union enlarges.
We must have the opportunity for members from every Member State to be able to vote on these reports and on these important amendments.
Madam President, a number of colleagues have remarked that it is a very bad thing to have so many votes on these occasions, but I would like to congratulate you on having kept us going.
I do not know for what purpose my constituents elected me if it was not to exercise discretion and choice in deciding what things to vote about.
I do not think we do a more important thing than cast our votes for and against proposals in this House and objecting to that is a very foolish thing.
Moreover, if one looks at the votes cast today, there were very few foregone conclusions: there were close votes on all the roll-call votes and that seems to me to show the need to test these matters by voting.
The idea that we should have fewer votes seems absurd.
That said, I should like to make a remark about the Watson report.
Once we have got to the point of having Community law, if that law is defied it seems perfectly obvious that there have to be within our nation States - and nations which are not States - criminal rules which uphold it, otherwise the States pass laws which they are not able to enforce and the Community becomes a laughing stock.
Of course, that requires a proper safeguard and proper defence rights.
These days we are thinking about defending our civilisation.
Our civilisation is to do with giving people proper rights of defence and I am sad at recent developments in the United Kingdom that seem to be ending these rights.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Madam President, although I had requested the floor to speak about ten documents, I shall limit myself to the explanations of vote on the Figueiredo and Chichester reports.
Proposal for a recommendation by Mr Watson (B5-0707/2001)
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities has voted against this recommendation because implementing it would be synonymous with finally withdrawing vital and crucial policy areas - namely policing and criminal law as these relate to the ordering of our ordinary lives - from the jurisdiction of the Member States and transferring them to the EU.
The recommendation is an absurd rhetorical demonstration of the parliamentary majority' s disconnection from reality, and in a double sense. Firstly, it is - even now - politically unthinkable for the governments of the Member States to endorse the adoption of a recommendation that would make it possible to introduce EU criminal law and to establish a federal police service.
Secondly, adoption of the recommendation would be out of step with actual social conditions which indicate that Parliament' s dream of a European federal state will prove to be a nightmare.
There are not one, but fifteen, different juridico-political cultures and systems in the EU.
EU criminal law and an EU police service would, at best, severely damage the Member States' legal traditions and, at worst, consolidate a centralised system without democratic control and, moreover, do so without solving the problems faced by the Member States.
The core of European cooperation should be diversity and respect for other countries' legal systems.
Figueiredo report (A5-0372/2001)
Madam President, of course, I voted for the Figueiredo report on the conciliation committee text on combating social exclusion.
I have to say that, in Italy, first the centre government, allied with the European socialist parties, increased the minimum Italian pensions greatly, from EUR 382 to EUR 490 per month; now, Mr Berlusconi' s centre-right government has increased them from EUR 382 to EUR 490 for people over 70 years old and has extended the categories of people entitled to receive them.
I call upon the other 14 States of the European Union and the 12 candidate countries to help pensioners and elderly people in the same way, and not just pensioners and elderly people but non-pensioners as well, for the right to life belongs to all people, whatever their age.
Mr President, I voted in favour of this report and I wanted to take this opportunity to say what a pity it is that the European Parliament and the European institutions are not as popular as they might be with the electorate and the people of the European Union because we are not in a position to respond appropriately and quickly to problems which arise and which we are aware of.
We have already seen this once this week with the transport of animals and now we are seeing it again with cross-border payments.
Over the years the public have become angry and have been forced to suffer losses, and now we are in the situation that we are lagging behind; hopefully this initiative of Mrs Peijs will now at least be implemented quickly.
As early as the time of the introduction of the euro I brought this issue to the attention of the Commissioner responsible, Mr Monti, and I asked the Commission to take action on it as quickly as possible.
As we can see it has taken years, and that is a shame because so much damage has been done.
I believe - to stress this once more - that we need to listen more closely to what members of the public have to say, pay more attention to their problems and then take appropriate action.
I should also like to add that I had indicated that I wished to make an explanation of vote on the Flemming report.
Obviously this will no longer be necessary.
We have voted against the proposal for a regulation on cross-border payments in euro, which is designed to prevent banks from imposing charges, falsely giving the impression that such payments are free.
This absurdity, which is motivated only by the desire to make people think that the euro itself removes all commissions on cross-border payments runs the risk of proving expensive for all of us in all kinds of unwanted ways.
Furthermore, this proposal is of very dubious legal value.
Its legal basis is Article 95(1) of the EC Treaty, which deals with the establishment of the internal market.
It should, therefore, apply in the same way to the fifteen members of the Union.
It does not, however, because three Members of the Union are not part of the euro zone.
Given these circumstances, it would probably have been more appropriate to make the regulation' s legal basis Article 123(4) of the EC Treaty (last phrase) concerning measures to adopt for the introduction of the euro, and does not, therefore, apply to the countries participating in the single currency.
Article 123(4), however, requires unanimous approval in Council, and Article 95 only requires a qualified majority.
This is probably the factor that tipped the scales in making some countries less reticent.
It is nevertheless difficult to imagine the reality of the legal situation in countries that are not members of the euro zone, that are forced to pay a premium for cross-border transfers made out in a currency other than their own.
To this bizarre situation we can add the absence in the regulation of any article referring to possible sanctions against recalcitrant banks.
Of course there is none, since the Community has no jurisdiction on this matter.
The European Parliament has sought to close this loophole by voting for an amendment that calls on the Member States to define and adopt sanctions that will act as a "deterrent" , but this type of request has no legal force.
.
There are only 46 days remaining before euro notes and coins are introduced across the twelve countries that are participating within this new euro currency regime.
Phasing out national currencies and introducing a single new European currency is not an easy task.
There are over 290 million people who live within the twelve new euro zone countries alone.
However, I do believe that EU Governments have been very pro-active with regard to implementing broad information campaigns concerning the forthcoming practical changes.
It is very important that both small and large businesses contact their local banks and estimate how much currency they will require to carry out their businesses commencing 1 January next.
Surveys carried out within the EU have shown that banks are confident that all ATM machines will have all the necessary stock of the new euro currency notes.
The European Central Bank is satisfied that the requisite amount of the new euro notes will be dispersed to financial institutions in non-Euro zone countries.
I believe that the five-week period for the changeover is of the correct duration.
It would simply be too much to ask small companies in Europe to deal with two different currencies for what was originally planned as a six-month period for the changeover.
I welcome the fact that the different consumer associations in Europe will be vigilant during the changeover period so as to ensure that the interests of consumers are protected during the timescale of the euro changeover.
I, of course, support the need to introduce measures which reduce costs between domestic and cross-border payments.
There is a very strong consumer case to be made for changing the current system which is in operation.
We must strengthen confidence in the structures of the new euro currency.
However, this proposed regulation which is before us today does not discriminate between efficient and inefficient payment systems.
This regulation does not adequately address the relationship between the euro and other non-euro Member State currencies.
I believe it is fair to say that the euro tends to promote economic stability.
I think there has been clear evidence of this since the tragic terrorist attacks which took place in America last September.
We do not want to give international currency speculators an opportunity to play off one national European currency against another.
This would only result in broader devaluations in the value of the euro which is exactly what took place in the Autumn of 1992.
The euro is good news for European businesses.
It reduces export costs.
It is good news for European travellers and it contributes to the medium to long-term economic stability of the European Union.
I have voted in favour of Mrs Peijs' s report and wish to emphasise the quality of the work that our rapporteur produced.
I am very pleased that our House is finally making a statement on an issue as important as this.
The patience of European consumers has clearly reached its limit.
It has to be said that the banks have gone too far by making one promise after another that they fail to keep, content in their certainty that Brussels would not dare restrict their freedom to impose charges.
The Commission has now been negotiating with them for eleven years... in vain.
The banks have always refused to make the necessary investment to keep the cost of cross-border transfers down.
At the same time, the current system allows them to build up a considerable pot of money for themselves.
Consumers are not the only ones to bear these unjustified bank charges: they have a particularly serious effect on SMEs that export their products and the competitiveness of these companies suffers for no good reason.
This situation, which has been incomprehensible to SMEs since the advent of the euro on 1 January 1999, is in danger of becoming explosive, with the euro entering into circulation in less than two months.
How is it possible that the euro zone is only a single payment area for notes and coins, with all other means of payment being discouraged by punitive bank charges?
How can banks justify a transfer from Lille to Bastia costing less than the same operation between Lille and Brussels?
One fear still remains and that is that the banks will use their freedom to impose charges to increase domestic prices in order to compensate for the lack of earning opportunities in the euro zone.
Nevertheless, as Commissioner Bolkestein said, 'The banks know very well that the public has legitimate expectations' .
We can only hope that the banks really are aware of this.
The European Union is made up of sovereign states, each with a seat in the United Nations and, so far, each boasting its own currency.
The banks form part of national payment circuits and impose a heavy fine on cross-border payments and money transfers.
From January 2002, twelve EU Member States will act as if they are one country financially speaking.
The banks are in favour of this as long as this enlarges their own scope, but not if they have to forgo the additional payments from their customers.
It seems appealing to demand that the costs for national and cross-border payments in euros should become the same.
That has been Commissioner Bolkestein' s wish for a long time and is now also being proposed in the report by Mrs Peijs.
I can endorse this, as long as it means that banks forgo their levies on cross-border payments.
However, recital 5bis does not prevent new levies from being imposed on national payments by way of compensation for the fact that revenue from foreign payments has fallen by the wayside.
Instead of imposing a heavy fine on a small minority of payments, including mainly business payments, all payments will then attract a minor fine.
That means that the large majority of customers will incur higher costs.
I shall vote against this, as this is highly detrimental to the ordinary account holder.
Chichester report (A5-0363/2001)
Mr President, the document tabled by Mr Chichester addresses the issue of energy supply and, in places, advocates the use of nuclear energy.
I have already stated on a number of occasions that both I personally and the Pensioners' Party are in favour of using nuclear energy.
I would like to stress, in particular, before this House, that I feel the candidate countries' nuclear power stations should be allowed to operate at full capacity.
In my capacity as a member of the joint EU-Bulgaria interparliamentary committee, I recently visited the Bohunice power station in Slovakia and the Kozloduy power station in Bulgaria.
Where their reactors meet certain safety requirements, these States should be allowed to use nuclear energy, for they do not have the economic resources to sustain an additional unnecessary cost just so they can replace one type of energy with another.
Where nuclear power stations are safe, we must allow them to be used, particularly those in the candidate countries.
Mr President, I very much welcome the tabling of the Commission's Green Paper on a strategy for the security of energy supply.
It is with great regret that I see that yet again too little attention has been paid to renewable sources of energy.
We will only achieve the Kyoto target if we give preference to these sources of energy.
I am therefore very disappointed at the vote on the Chichester report because here too nuclear energy is still the preferred option.
With the consumption of energy increasing and the sources and reserves of mineral fuels decreasing, the energy supply issue is a very important aspect of the internal and external policy of the EU and the Member States.
The Chichester report may highlight the need to save energy, improve energy efficiency and develop more efficient transmission systems, but it places its hopes for resolving the problem in the liberalisation of the market and competition, on the one hand, and in controlling supplier countries, on the other.

This approach works to the benefit of more general imperialist interests and to the detriment of the workers and society as a whole, in both supplier and consumer countries, which are being sacrificed so that the multinationals which create and exploit recessions and provoke wars which allow them to control the energy-rich areas of the world can make a profit.
Energy policies to make use of domestic energy sources obey the same diktat, with adverse repercussions on grass-roots interests, growth and the supply of high-quality, safe and environmentally-friendly energy to the country as a whole.
The problem is exacerbated by the liberalisation of the energy market and the privatisation of power stations and transmission grids.
We consider that the strategically important energy sector (supply of raw materials, generation, transmission grids) should be in the public sector and should be subject to periodically adjusted national planning which takes account of national requirements and international circumstances.
Energy policy should safeguard cheap energy for grass-roots needs, guarantee the safety of workers and citizens and ensure that the environment is protected.
These should be primary objectives and should take precedence over any economic factors.
Transport policy needs to be revised so that greater use is made of public transport, renewable sources of energy need to be supported and encouraged and research is needed into the most efficient generating systems and the cheapest, least-polluting consumption systems.
The EU and the Member States need to respond to the need to protect the environment and to fail to reduce emissions to Kyoto levels is to practise wicked works.
Major climate problems, the hole in the ozone layer and so on must not be resolved at the expense of growth in the poorest countries, at the expense of the workers or by fatalistically accepting the destruction of our planet.
Workers in Europe and throughout the world and the 2 billion people with no access to electricity are demanding and fighting for a different energy policy which opposes imperialist interests and preferences and the monopolies which are usurping the energy sector. A policy which respects and protects the environment, a policy which will create the foundations for humane living conditions.
This being so, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece have voted against the Chichester report.
By making as issue out of Europe' s energy dependence, the report is masking the fact that we are dependent mainly not so much on other countries as on the huge oil corporations which often also control other sources of energy.
This is the dependence that Europe paid a high price for during the oil crisis in 1973, when these corporations decided to impose a general price increase on oil to increase the profits of their less profitable wells.
It is this dependence on oil companies that has led to the 'serious risk of price instability in the short run and lack of resources in the long run' , which concerns the report.
It is not the unfair distribution of the world' s energy sources, a geological factor, that threatens the rational use of resources in a way that respects the natural environment, but rather the fact that their management is controlled by huge private groups, which are solely concerned with their profit margins, when they themselves are not suffering from the erratic fluctuations of the market or even of stock speculation.
The problem does not only affect Europe: the world' s resources cannot be managed rationally and distributed amongst everyone if a collective effort is agreed on at world level, which would mean an end to the stranglehold of private groups on these resources and a completely different organisation of the economy.
During the debate in plenary on Tuesday evening, I stated my support for the 'Chichester' package on the security of energy supply, despite its calls for the liberalisation of the energy sector that I could not have supported had they been proposed in isolation but which, as it happens, are part of a whole multifaceted and bold 'package' , which takes the European discussion on this matter forwards.
This is why I have voted in favour of the 'package' .
Incidentally, I still do not understand how someone can advocate a liberalisation that seeks to bring prices down and which takes the form of promoting the 'least costly' sources of energy and, on the other hand, complains about being increasingly dependent on external sources as consumption increases (or is not decreasing) due to the fact that prices are very (or too) low.
I hope one day to receive a clear explanation of this point from the 'founders' of liberalisation.
The Chichester report seeks to present a 'European strategy' for the security of energy supply.
It is very difficult, however, to discern in the resolution, even one clearly stated guideline.
It could be saying anything and its opposite.
The resolution dodges the real issues underpinning a 'strategy' .
Is it possible to restructure the energy sector without a real concerted public policy that is supported and has been fully discussed?
Can we leave things up to the 'market' , in other words, to the whim of private financial interests?
Is energy a 'common asset' or just a commodity?
To what extent is the nuclear risk acceptable?
The resolution is dotted with pipe dreams.
For example, in order to permit the renewal of nuclear power stations, it calls for "appropriate measures" that will guarantee the "elimination" of radioactive waste and the "safety" of the power stations.
This is asking the impossible.
Apart from being confused, the Chichester report falls in line with neoliberal policies.
Paragraph 18 wants to "promote further market opening in the EU" and paragraph 42 considers that "it is essential to complete the liberalisation of energy markets' ' .
Whereas only a public service policy can meet social and environmental requirements and guarantee "sustainable development" in this economic sector.
We are voting against the motion for a resolution.
- (PT) Some of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur suggest that the increase in installed capacity of nuclear energy in Europe is crucial if we are to comply with the Kyoto protocol.
This argument is irrational and lacks objectivity.
All the information available suggests that the opposite is true.
The European Union has already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 4% between 1990 and 1999 and will be able to meet the quota for remaining reductions by 2012 (4%) through low cost measures.
According to data from the European Commission, we will be able to comply with Kyoto by implementing measures costing less than EUR 20 per tonne of CO2.
The promotion of nuclear energy does not feature amongst these measures proposed by the European Commission in the European Climate Change Programme and the Framework Directive on Emissions Trading.
The issue of Member States' energy supply is a fundamental aspect of their security which falls mainly within the competence of national sovereignty.
Given the major interactions of energy choices, however, it might be useful to do as the Green Paper does and opt for a longer-term approach and study this issue at European level.
This study must, of course, be carried out without any ideological prejudices that might demonise or romanticise any particular source of energy.
Otherwise, we will be leaving rational discourse behind.
This is the approach adopted by the Chichester report, emphasising, as does the Green Paper, the need for Member States to maintain a balanced combination of energy sources, which gives nuclear energy its rightful place.
This is the only way not to make European countries more dependent on external sources.
It is also the only way to ensure that the European Union can fulfil its international commitments on limiting CO2 emissions.
Research and development in nuclear energy must, therefore, continue in order to build on our scientific and industrial lead in this field, in order to guarantee our countries maximum independence in the field of energy resources, to preserve the environment and to achieve a satisfactory elimination of waste end-products.
I am sorry, with regard to this last point, that the Caudron report has not attached sufficient priority to this line of research, which is crucial.
Unless we move ahead in this direction, the growth in demand will lead us fatally towards fossil fuels, which are as worthy of criticism in terms of the environment as they are problematic in terms of security of supply.
Flemming report (A5-0341/2001)
Mr President, just before I begin on the Flemming report I want to speak about the Katiforis report, which we rejected.
I feel very strongly that by rejecting that report we have done nothing today in this House to promote public health.
We should never forget that tobacco is the biggest cause of preventable illness across the EU and that each year half a million EU citizens die needlessly due to tobacco.
The Commission's proposal would have helped people to stop smoking and it is very sad that we did not support this.
However, on to the matter at hand - the Flemming report.
Although the report was rejected, I should like to explain why I and my two colleagues from Scotland supported some of the amendments.
Firstly, we believe that, in line with Amendment No 3, no country may be obliged to hand over water against its will and free of charge.
The amendment speaks for itself, and that it is why we supported it.
Amendment No 5 was concerned with the more technical matter of water basins.
We agree that water basin areas are not suitable bases for water pricing policies in all regions.
Much of our water in Scotland is in inter-basin management and, therefore, we had to support it.
Thirdly, the rejection of the Flemming report probably was ensuring that no one report could be hijacked by such a national interest.
I hope we will continue the discussion on water, as so many of our citizens are very concerned with this issue.
The report fully endorses the Commission communication, the philosophy of which is to treat a natural resource, water, as a commodity and as a basis for implementing other negative sectoral policies, such as agricultural policy.
We categorically oppose this philosophy and the negative proposals tabled in order to implement it.
The report is geared towards "pricing policies to enhance the sustainability of water resources", which involve recovering the cost of water-related services and limiting the consumption and use of water by making it more expensive.
At the same time, the report is gripped by the familiar "polluter pays" principle, resulting in new incentives and profits for business.
The price - and it is a very high price - of the measures proposed on the hypocritical pretext of supposedly securing the sustainability of water resources, will be paid by the consumer, for which read farmers in southern Europe, given that, as both the Commission communication and the report state, it is they who consume the most water and pay less than the "real cost" for it.
This policy will cause costs to rise and will wipe out even more small and medium-sized farms, which are already suffering the disastrous consequences of the common agricultural policy.
Predictably, the report divides the cost into financial, environmental and resource costs and considers that only the financial cost has been calculated in the past.
Thus, to refer to the report yet again, it states that the cost of building and operating dams on rivers due to over-extraction (by farmers) "may be passed on to the users" or, if water needs to be treated because it has been contaminated, for example by fertilisers, then farmers should pay the cost.
We are opposed to any attempt to treat water as a commodity.
We categorically refuse to allow the Commission to appoint itself as the guardian of water resources and, on the pretext of "encouraging sustainable water use" to add, yet again, grist to the mill of private interests and allow them to penetrate and operate in what is a purely public utility sector.
The entire endeavour is nothing more than yet another chapter in the Community's catastrophic policy. It will work to the detriment of consumers and farmers and, at the same time, champion the promotion of other policies, such as the policy to wipe out the agricultural sector.
Water resources cannot be protected and managed rationally using suppressive pricing policies and collection measures paid for by the consumer.
Only a few large companies charging a high price for their "environmentally-friendly" profile stand to benefit from this policy, which gives them yet another opportunity to rake in vastly inflated profits.
The report' s recitals state that water "is not a commercial product like any other" and that "access to water is an inalienable human right" .
Such statements, however, carry little weight with Vivendi, Suez and other huge corporations, who have appropriated the water 'market' for themselves in order to squeeze enormous profits from it, with the blessing of the State.
These statements look more like a desperate plea, considering the industries that pollute and ruin the planet' s resources for the greater good of their shareholder' s bank accounts.
In the twenty-first century, at a time when the world has never had such great technical capability, the fact that an entire swathe of humanity does not have access to running water, let alone drinking water is largely due to the social barbarity of capitalism.
The issue of water, which is vital for hundreds of millions of human beings far exceeds the geographical boundaries of Europe and, if we are to solve it, and many other problems, humanity would need to put an end to the dictatorship of the market, of profit and of competition.
The rapporteur supports this system and envisages the "sustainable management of water resources" by means of pricing and rate setting.
This would mean, once again, that those with the means, both individuals and particularly industrial groups, could continue to waste water, even to pollute, whilst others who are poorer, will continue to do without.
Society should provide water, this vital commodity, free of charge to everyone and its management should be planned according to the real needs of the population and subject to democratic control.
It is quite clear that the current organisation of the economy, based on the quest for profit, is fundamentally incapable of guaranteeing a "sustainable management of water resources" and consequently represents a threat to the future of mankind, in this area as in many others.
People themselves consist largely of water, and the bulk of our food is also made up of water.
Similarly, we very often deal with water in our jobs and households.
Without a continuous supply of water, we would not survive.
Whoever appropriates water, takes possession of their fellow people.
That is why the water supply should not end up in private hands.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy rightly concluded that access to water is a human right and water is therefore not a commercial product.
The question now arises as to how we manage water shortages and water pollution.
The fair principle that the polluter pays is useful to cream profits from polluting companies, but not a sound argument to considerably increase the costs for households.
It is better to increase the amount of clean and fresh drinking water available by desalinating sea water than by digging deeper for ground water or by redirecting rivers to storage reservoirs.
There was a time when the Soviet Union wanted to fill the Aral Sea with water from rivers which flow to the North Pole.
These days, Spain wants to tap half of the Ebro' s water to promote tourism in southern Spain.
This will be at the expense of fauna and flora in the current river basin.
Thanks to criticism on this, the Right has blocked this decision.
This proves that money and prestige are still worth more than sustainable environmental management.
, in writing.
(PT) Despite protests from Portuguese NGOs and myself, the Portuguese government is insisting on adopting an uncompromising approach to the Alqueva project, by preparing to fill the dam to a height of 152m.
This Communication and the report on sustainable water pricing show that filling the dam to a height of 139m, as I have been proposing, would not only enable more than 600 000 trees and habitats of enormous importance to be saved, but would also be more sustainable in economic terms.
We risk deforesting to a height of 152m and then, due to the price of water, seeing that filling to a height of 139m is enough for agricultural requirements.
Over the past few days, Member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Alexander de Roo, has insinuated both in this House and in the media that the Liberal shadow rapporteur, Chris Davies, has changed his position under pressure from the Aznar Government in connection with the possible election of Pat Cox to President of Parliament.
This was an absurd and unfounded allegation.
Mr Davies has conscientiously attempted to reconcile his own dislike of the Spanish project (shared by myself) with the position of the majority of the liberal group that it is inappropriate to criticise a specific country in a general report.
Today' s vote illustrated that our group has abstained and that Mr Davis and various Green members of the ELDR Group have voted in favour of the criticism levelled at Spain.
However, by voting against the Liberal amendment (which, in turn, led to the rejection of the entire report), the Greens have missed a major opportunity of stopping the Spanish project on the basis of general principles.
Although the intentions of the Group of the Greens may have been noble, their method was neither effective nor conclusive.
At the moment, the European Parliament does not have a single position in this weighty matter.
Riis-Jørgensen report (A5-0373/2001)
Shipbuilding has for years benefited from considerable subsidies from Member States and from the European institutions.
This has not stopped it from shedding its workforce or even from closing entire dockyards and sacking their employees.
Dockyard owners are attempting to have these subsidies extended in the name of competition, but the money that would be given to them would continue to increase the profit of these companies and to be shared with their shareholders even if the latter withdraw their capital as soon as the dockyards become less profitable and invest elsewhere, without a care for the fate of the workers.
This is made easier for them by the fact that many dockyards are tied to industrial groups such as Alstom, which have interests in several sectors and which make redundancies in some whilst receiving subsidies in others.
As we have no intention of giving any kind of help to the shareholders of the huge shipbuilding corporations, we have voted against the report.
If shipbuilding is necessary for Europe' s economy, it must be brought under state control. The answer is not to subsidise its private owners with money that we will never see again.
.
(DE) My group welcomes the Commission's proposal to introduce a temporary defensive mechanism for European shipyards in the light of the breakdown in the negotiations to put an immediate end to the unfair international competition in the shipbuilding sector.
We also fully support the parliamentary amendments contained in the report, and in particular the one extending the duration of the measure until the end of 2003.
For some time now, together with colleagues from other groups, my group has been highlighting the general problems faced by European shipbuilding and the specific problems resulting from the international situation.
In September, the Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left visited eastern Germany to familiarise itself with the situation faced by shipyards there and made renewed pleas to the Commission to take action.
We see it as positive that a Commission proposal has now at last been tabled, which assures the yards, which have clearly suffered considerable damage because of unfair Korean trade practices, that help is at hand in the form of solutions which can be implemented quickly.
Many of these yards are in structurally weak regions with very severe economic and social problems and form the core of the existing economic structure.
Their existence and prosperity are the only way to secure thousands of jobs and safeguard the economic development of these regions.
However, my group also believes that further measures are necessary to safeguard the future of European shipbuilding, which is one of the essential branches of European industry.
These might include, in particular:
programmes to promote investment, which will have a long-term structural impact and create jobs;
the promotion of European cooperation on research and development in areas which affect the maritime economy;
the development of a coordinated maritime policy at European level;
the formulation and implementation of a European transport policy which seeks to move freight and passenger transport from the land to the sea.
We call on the Commission to take a stance on the fundamental issues surrounding the future of European shipbuilding in the first half of 2002 and to propose an action programme to resolve the medium- and long-term problems.
I have voted in favour of this proposal because it is the lesser of two evils.
Nevertheless, this feet-dragging over unfair competition, now with South Korea, is allowing business to shift to the Far East, leading to the eradication of all shipbuilding activity in the European Union, including repairs and renovation as well as the building of new vessels.
Without operational and technologically up-to-date shipyards, our strategies for maritime safety, employment and regional cohesion will be at risk, and will be hard to recover with palliative measures.
Katiforis report (A5-0352/2001)
. (IT) Like all the Members in Chamber, I feel that the protection and safeguarding of human health are vital.
I therefore consider that it is of the utmost importance to uphold the position calling for the introduction of both a minimum excise duty of 57 % and a minimum payment - EUR 70 - with the aim of increasing the sales price of tobacco.
The measure is very important in that it will discourage regular consumers from using tobacco. Furthermore, it will have a preventive effect in that it will discourage those tempted to use tobacco for the first time from doing so.
As I have already pointed out in a written question - reference number P-2140/99 - to the European Commission, I find it absurd that we should increase European financing and contributions to tobacco growers while, at the same time, declaring that we are working to combat smoking.
I therefore call upon the European Parliament to support this measure and throw some light on the matter.
Quite clearly, the proviso must be that the Member States, as Community bodies, also increase their endeavours to prevent, control and curb illegal trading and trafficking in cigarettes.
. (IT) I voted for the Katiforis legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 92/79/EEC, Directive 92/80/EEC and Directive 95/59/EC as regards the structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco products, which calls upon the Commission to withdraw its proposal for a number of reasons unanimously upheld by the entire Italian section of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (Republicans, Democrats and members of the Italy of Values party).
The proposal to revise the current subsidies for tobacco growing would have had a disastrous effect on the economies of entire rural areas which are some of the most disadvantaged in the European Union, as can be seen from a recent European statistical analysis carried out by Eurostat.
The Commission addresses the 'tobacco issue' purely from the point of view of health, which is why it attempts to question the provision of Community aid to growers and goes so far as to propose an early revision of the COM in tobacco in order to reduce quotas and cut subsidies to the sector.
We feel that this opinion errs in that it is too rash, and I am glad to say that it was amended at the Gothenburg Summit.
We are convinced that it would be wrong to penalise an agricultural sector which is at the heart of the economy of countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain.
Instead of reducing cigarette consumption, the Commission' s proposal would have created nothing but problems for manufacturers, who would have been forced to change the process of importing supplies from third countries with the result that national productions would have been replaced by lower quality imports.
Lastly, we feel that the position of those who advocate combating smoking by abolishing aid to tobacco growers is ambiguous.
Strangely, in fact, the Member States which do not grow tobacco but which have not banned smoking would receive sums benefiting their Northern European style of agriculture, which is already sufficiently subsidised, and, what is more, they would hypocritically continue to rake in millions of euro in taxes and excise duties on tobacco products and accessories.
Schörling report (A5-0356/2001)
To its credit, the Schörling report points out that "The EU is the world's leading producer of chemicals" and that "it is high time that we developed a new strategy for controlling chemicals" . We know that the "vast majority of existing chemicals - that have been on the market for at least 20 years - have never been properly tested" and we discover that certain serious diseases are on the increase and that "a link between these diseases and exposure to chemicals is likely" .
The report therefore recommends the rigorous control of chemicals available on the market, testing prior to any distribution of these products - and the withdrawal of any products that do not pass these tests - and a range of restrictive measures for manufacturers and commercial distributors, intended to force them to guarantee minimum safety standards.
This position does consider the interests of the public but is unpopular with the Union des Industries Chimiques, a French employers' organisation which, in a letter to Members of the European Parliament, protests about the constraints that we are attempting to impose on companies that manufacture or sell chemical products.
This shameless lobbying by chemical company owners is in itself enough to make us vote for the Schörling report and for the measures it proposes, even if the rapporteur elsewhere declares herself to be in favour of the market.
.
Both the White Paper from the Commission and the report drawn up by Mrs Schorling are flawed, the latter fundamentally.
The report is based on the general assumption that there are a large number of chemicals that pose a threat to both human health and the environment, and ignores the positive health and environmental benefits to society arising form many man-made chemicals.
Paragraph 16 of the report seeks to extend the REACH system to cover chemicals manufactured in volumes of under one tonne per year; this will lead to a possible twenty-fold increase in the number of chemicals requiring authorisation, and an impossible workload for those given that task.
The scope should be limited to those chemicals produced in volumes over one tonne, as set out in the White Paper.
Paragraph 38, which sets out which substance shall be classified as being of very high concern, is too broad for any authorisation system to be workable.
The definition should be restricted to CMR (categories 1 and 2), and POP substances, as defined in the Stockholm Convention.
The provisions of the report will lead to an unacceptable increase in the amount of tests carried out on animals.
A report by the Institute of Environmental Health in the United Kingdom, estimated that 12.8 million animals will be needed in the testing of 30,000 chemicals.
These figures have been echoed by many European animal welfare groups.
The rapporteur recognises this problem, but places too much faith in the availability and acceptability of non-animal tests.
Furthermore, to gather "base-set" level of information simply for chemicals manufactured in volumes over one tonne per year will take approximately 36 years alone, according to the IEH report.
The timescale set out in the report (2008) is thus completely unrealistic.
The European chemicals industry has been consulted far too late, and its attempts at self-regulation (e.g. Product Stewardship, the Long Range Research Initiative and "Confidence in Chemicals") have been completely ignored by the rapporteur in this report.
Since the proposals in the report look likely to increase the administrative burden on the industry (particularly SMEs), as well as dent its competitiveness on a global scale, this is a serious oversight.
.
(DE) I have just voted against the Schörling Report.
The Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats, to which I belong, did not manage to secure a majority in favour of its constructive amendments.
What has now been adopted has clearly been influenced too much by ideology.
Of course this is about environmental safety, but it is also about competitive and innovative jobs in the chemical industry.
Over the last few weeks I have been investigating the consequences of the Schörling Report by talking to those whom it will affect.
I have visited production plants and had discussions with management, workers and unions.
None of those parties is calling into question the aim of the Commission's White Paper, which is to secure the sustainability of the chemical industry.
From an ecological point of view, we obviously need the greatest possible protection of the environment and consumers.
From an economic point of view, we need uniform basic conditions so as to ensure that there is fair competition for SMEs, users and processors.
From a social point of view this is about having a high level of health protection and high standards of industrial safety.
At least we were able to prevent the registration requirement for substances with a production volume of one tonne per year from being introduced.
As it is, the current classification of substances above 10 tonnes per year and the reporting requirement before they are put on the market is only being managed by the authorities with great difficulty.
The European People's Party Group did succeed in one respect: there was no majority in favour of double testing all chemicals.
This does not increase safety and is costly in terms of time and money; incidentally it is completely unnecessary because the authorities already examine these data.
I do not consider it acceptable to find substitutes for dangerous substances and methods which should otherwise be banned.
You cannot define a substance as 'dangerous' on the basis of its properties, but only on the basis of its uses.
Take a knife: it is extremely useful at home and in everyday life, but it becomes dangerous if it is used as a weapon for anything from attacking people to hijacking aircraft.
It is also regrettable that it has been agreed that confidential data should be made public: if production volumes, procedures or special compositions, which account for a market advantage, all have to be declared, then we may as well do away with competition right now.
This is the lifeblood of our companies.
Any competitor can easily imitate ingenious systems.
We need to establish once and for all which data are subject to property rights and which are not.
Before the second reading in Parliament, I hope that the three committees working on this will put their heads together and come up with a more balanced proposal.
- (PT) I am delighted, not only with the content of the European Commission' s new policy on chemicals, but also with the importance it is attaching to this policy, as clearly demonstrated in the strategy approved by the European Union for the 'Rio+10' Conference, which is due to take place in 2002.
I welcome, in particular, the following points:
1) A complete ban, within a generation, in other words by 2020, of discharges and emissions into the environment of all dangerous substances.
2) The creation of a single system for the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals (REACH), replacing the current system that treats new substances and existing ones differently.
3) The adoption of the precautionary principle, through reversing the burden of proof for substances that cause great concern.
It will now fall to the manufacturer to prove that a product is not dangerous.
I welcome the Schörling report but prefer, where the tonnage threshold is concerned, the position of the European Commission.
This system, if it proves feasible, will protect Europe' s citizens.
Using the same system to evaluate substances produced in volumes below and above one tonne per year will make the system too cumbersome and, therefore, contrary to objectives that have been defined.
I wish to explain my reasons for voting in favour of this report as amended.
First of all, I feel that it adopts a balanced position, which will improve environmental protection and public health on the one hand and which maintains the competitiveness of the chemical industry on the other, in line with the strategy for sustainable development adopted in Göteborg.
We must understand the fact that only a tiny minority of the more than 100 000 chemical substances in existence have to date been tested and that, furthermore, they are being produced in greater numbers each year.
Consequently, only 14% of chemical substances produced in a quantity of more than one tonne are given a classification under the current system.
The tragic events in Toulouse recently demonstrated the urgent need to close this gap in our knowledge.
At the same time, we need to create a system of registration, assessment and authorisation that is 'manageable' for public authorities and that the industry can, in due course, supplement with the necessary data.
The report' s approach seems to be equally balanced because, apart from purely environmental considerations, it takes account of various socio-economic aspects of prospective legislation, not least the fact that workers in the chemical industry are more exposed, and the specific constraints affecting small and medium-sized enterprises.
Similarly, the report favours transparency whilst respecting data protection and industrial secrecy, which I think is to be welcomed.
Clear references to the precautionary principle and the substitution principle have, furthermore, been added to the Commission text.
Lastly, one of the most important points, to my mind, is still the requirement for all substances to be registered, even if some of them are only registered in a simplified form.
It is often the substances produced in smaller quantities that are the most dangerous for health or for the environment.
I also feel that the timetables put forward in the report are appropriate because they are realistic.
I am very pleased that the White Paper will be followed up with a range of legislative proposals by the Commission and I look forward with great interest to seeing them.
The Committee on the Environment' s vote on this report sends a clear message to industry and to the national authorities to thoroughly monitor chemical substances, and this must be accompanied by the elimination of substances that are toxic and harmful to health and to the environment.
We therefore fully support the approach of this report which improves, on a number of points, the already ambitious Commission proposal.
Having said that, in order to be understood, our message must also be balanced.
This is why we support a pragmatic approach and reject a raft of unrealistic demands that would heavily penalise the European chemical industry.
I wish to point out that this industry directly or indirectly involves no less than 5 million jobs.
I shall turn first of all to paragraph 16, which calls for the registration of all substances of less than one tonne in weight: this means that 100 000 products are involved instead of the 30 000 proposed by the Commission, tens of thousands of files, impossible bureaucracy, a nightmare for the numerous SMEs in the sector and all of this for products which, for the most part, never reach the market.
Extending the scope of the authorisation procedure (paragraph 38) is also unfeasible: in order to avoid an unmanageable situation, we call, in Amendment No 68, for substances for which there is no proof of toxicity to be excluded.
In conclusion, although we must send a message that is powerful, it must also be credible.
Sending a declaration of war to industry, to the workers and to the national authorities seems neither appropriate nor productive.
Given the risk that chemicals present to people' s health and to the environment, we Swedish Christian Democrats believe it to be obvious that, in accordance with the principle of 'no data, no marketing' , chemicals which have not undergone certain tests should not be allowed to be marketed, either.
Furthermore, we support the substitution principle which has long been a well-established principle of Swedish chemicals policy.
In the same way, we believe that a reversed burden of proof should apply to substances that give cause for concern, which means that it is the industry, not the authorities, which has to demonstrate that a subject can be used in an acceptable way.
Because chemicals can involve significant risks in smaller quantities too, we believe that chemicals in quantities of less than a tonne which are imported to, or produced within, the EU should also be covered by the new system.
In that way, we shall in quite a few respects be departing from the position adopted by the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats.
Corbey report (A5-0323/2001)
These days, outrageous packaging is a form of advertising in order to entice buyers.
A great deal of material is wasted on it.
It sounds environmentally aware to blame the consumers who buy packaged food or packaged products. However, those consumers do not create waste themselves, but are left with it following their purchases.
They become the victim of conditional sales, because these days, it is often impossible to buy anything without wrapping.
That is why we need to tackle the production and sale of waste at source instead of focusing on the consumers.
In the proposed resolution, Mrs Corbey is right to make manufactures and retailers responsible for the prevention of the production of packaging waste and notes that precious little has been achieved since the 1994 packaging directive.
The European Commission remains disinclined to present fresh proposals, and the Member States implement earlier recycling agreements with a delay of years.
The rapporteur' s proposal is still torn between two ideas.
I wholeheartedly agree with her attempt to prevent waste.
However, I differ with her on the proposal to get the consumer to pay more for all that waste.
Re-use may be important, but is not the most important solution.
Salafranca Sánchez Negra report (A5-0336/2001)
We are voting against the report in spite of the sound initiatives it contains concerning partnership between the EU and the Latin American countries on, for example, conflict prevention, development cooperation and combating poverty and the drugs trade.
Our opposition is due to the fact that a number of the proposals in the report take supranational cooperation on, for example, defence, security and foreign policy, as well as on areas of institutional, legal and internal concern as something that goes without saying in the EU.
We believe that cooperation in the aforesaid areas can be fully engaged in through intergovernmental cooperation.
The few words the report contains on "health, education and the fight against abject poverty" , "the fight against drugs" and "protection of the environment" , some of the objectives that the European Union claims it is promoting in that part of the world, are nothing more than a smokescreen for considerably more disreputable intentions.
By proposing that "the aim of the new agreement should ultimately be the bilateral and preferential liberalisation, on a gradual and reciprocal basis, of the trade in all kinds of goods and services between the two regions, in accordance with WTO rules," the countries of the European Union are showing that they could not care less about the fate of the peoples of Latin America. They would like, first and foremost, to make up for their slowness in penetrating the Latin American markets, which are already in a parlous state due to the presence of even more powerful predators, such as the North American multinationals.
Instead of the promised development, the opening up of the markets to huge companies and to the financial establishment has plunged Latin America into poverty.
At least 224 million Latin Americans live in abject poverty, in other words, more than 40% of the population of that region!
And there is not even any discussion of cancelling the debts that are strangling these countries.
We have consequently voted against this report.
- (PT) The Rio summit of 28/29 June 1999 marked the beginning of a new phase in bi-regional relations with a view to creating a strategic partnership between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean.
The main objectives of the new Joint Strategy must, in line with the priorities adopted in Rio, be political, such as with the extension of the Bi-Regional Political Agenda; the update and revision of political dialogue at ministerial level and the creation of a EU-Latin American Transatlantic Assembly; economic, financial and commercial, such as the conclusion of various Association Agreements and the creation of a EU-Latin America Free Trade Area, which is planned for 2010, and social and cultural, such as the creation of a Bi-regional Solidarity Fund and a global plan to combat drugs, amongst others.
I therefore give my total support to the rapporteur' s position reiterating the need to establish the bi-regional strategic partnership approved at the Rio summit and in the recommendation to the European Council with a view to approving the EU' s common strategy for Latin America and the Caribbean, on the basis of the objectives established in the Rio summit' s priorities.
Lastly, the report highlights the need to improve cooperation on the basis of a sustained and integrated partnership, with a view to promoting human development and the development of civil society and the consequent benefits to all levels of society.
Motion for a resolution on air transport (B5-0702/2001)
Claiming that the airlines are suffering as a result of the 11 September attacks on the United States is a barefaced lie.
Although some carriers have had problems, these are not new and not all airlines are in that position. Far from it.
Air France' s share dividends, for example, have increased by 22%, and this happened three days after the attacks on New York and Washington.
It has just bought out Air Afrique and brought Alitalia under its wing as well as the Czech airline CSA.
And, like other large European airlines, it is also doing very well out of the bankruptcies of AOM-Air Liberté, Sabena and Swissair.
This is the result of giving free rein to the market, which national and European leaders claim should govern everything, the economy and the fate of workers.
In recent years in Europe, this has led to hundreds of thousands of job losses in the air transport sector alone, which does not cause national and European leaders to bat an eyelid because huge profits are consequently pocketed by the companies' shareholders, such as the incredibly wealthy Baron Seillière, the French "bosses' boss" .
The attacks of 11 September have simply been an excuse for the capitalists in the air transport sector to receive new subsidies while pursuing their offensive against their employees.
And they have been aided and protected in this endeavour by the various national governments.
We have seen this again recently in France, in Belgium and in Switzerland with companies going bankrupt and sacking tens of thousands of employees, at no cost at all to the key players who are largely responsible for these bankruptcies, such as Baron Seillière.
We have, therefore, voted against this motion for a resolution which is cynical enough to claim that it is for the sake of employment that it wants to give further subsidies to the companies and capitalists in the air transport sector, who are already responsible for making hundreds of thousands of people redundant.
The reason why I am unable to vote for this resolution is that it is mainly founded on the idea of protecting the expansion of aviation which, until recently, was deemed self-evident.
To date, this expansion has posed a major problem for the environment, leading to increasing levels of pollution, growing insecurity and increasing pressure on public space for airports.
Furthermore, aviation firmly had the edge on railways in terms of taxes, because kerosene is still not taxed, while all forms of travel on the ground are.
Even before 11 September, there was every reason to search for possibilities to stop and reverse this expansion.
The fact that the number of passengers has now dropped dramatically should not be a reason for supporting airline companies by granting even more tax money, but rather a reason for investing in the improvement of other forms of intra-European passenger transport.
A surcharge on the aircraft rates which have taken a nose dive over the last few years due to competition can cover the dramatic upsurge in insurance premiums.
There is no reason for injecting more public funding into aviation.
However, that money is needed desperately to protect the position of the workers of airline companies.
They thought for years that they had a secure, government-protected job in a growth industry, but the industry is now shrinking or even going bankrupt.
(The sitting was suspended at 2.00 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)
Protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer
The next item is the report (A5-0348/2001) by Mr Bouwman, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on amending Council Directive 80/987/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer [COM(2000) 832 - C5-0017/2001 - 2001/0008(COD)].
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before we start the debate on my report - and I hope you are also keeping an eye on the time - I should like to raise a matter in connection with the way in which we will be dealing with this report further.
It was scheduled to be debated before twelve noon.
It has overrun.
There is nothing that can be done about this, for that is how it is in this House.
It is a report in the framework of the codecision procedure on employees' rights and insolvency.
I, as rapporteur, have nothing against the fact that we are debating it now, but I do disagree with the fact that we would subsequently vote on it during a very vague gathering of votes later on this afternoon.
I should therefore like to request - and I have already discussed this with the larger groups - to decide beforehand that we will debate the report now but that we will postpone the vote to the brief part-session in Brussels and possibly to a later date, although I am very much opposed to this.
That also gives us the opportunity of tabling a number of amendments and changes as a whole.
It seemed a totally uncontroversial report, but nevertheless, there are a number of elements which require further discussion.
That is why I would ask to postpone the vote until the next part-session.
I do not know whether you can respond to this now.
Thank you, Mr Bouwman, I have taken note of your request.
We can have one speaker in favour of your request and one speaker against.
Who would like to speak out in favour?
That is Mrs Van den Burg. You have the floor for one minute.
I should like to support the request because in my view, it is indeed inappropriate to be voting on a report in the framework of the codecision procedure in a very small gathering of this Parliament.
Furthermore, it will probably give us some more time to consider other compromises for issues which are currently controversial, because it is also a complex report which contains a number of ambiguities about the different amendments.
I would therefore like to support the request.
Thank you, Mrs Van den Burg.
Mr Gollnisch would like to speak against the request.
You have one minute.
I do not really need a minute, Madam President. I requested the floor on a point of order, but, in fact, my point fully echoes the concerns of the rapporteur.
I would like to know whether the Commission might be able to give us any indication of its reasons for withdrawing its communication initially scheduled on the agenda on the World Trade Organisation and, possibly, when this important communication might be given.
Madam President, I just wish to say that it was impossible for Mr Lamy to be here because the WTO meeting lasted longer than expected.
So the Commission will certainly make a statement to Parliament on the WTO, but I cannot say when that will be.
Mr Lamy will come here as soon as he can.
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou, I can only endorse what you have just said.
I myself have only just returned from Doha, and it was a tough negotiating round.
Mr Lamy only landed in Brussels at 6 a.m. this morning, so I trust we can all be accommodating in this matter.
Mr Bouwman, I am giving you, as rapporteur, the floor for five minutes to present your report.
I should like to express my thanks once again, for the broad support for the proposals.
This might well be a Pyrrhic victory, but we shall have to wait and see.
I wanted to raise the following matter.
We have here a document on employees' rights in the event of insolvency, that is to say when a business is no longer able to meet its financial obligations.
It is a revision of Council Directive 80/987EEC with a number of improvements on what was in there before.
A directive such as this aims to give a minimum level of protection in the event of insolvency.
Almost at the same time that I was appointed rapporteur for this dossier, a group of people turned up from the Sintel company in Spain - a company that was split off from Telefonica, sold by them, in fact. They had been campaigning in Madrid for months because they had not been paid for months.
In other words, in addition to what I already knew at the time, this realistic description was sufficient to show me at first-hand how significant this report, concealed behind a mass of insolvency terminology, is.
The old document, of course, dates back to 1980.
A great deal has changed since then, especially within the labour markets, in terms of types of employees and descriptions of the same, the economy has become more globalised and internationalised, there are more businesses that operate both within a certain country and outside it.
In addition, there are still cases where it is unclear which country ought to pay out social security benefits.
Of course, there have been a number of procedures for the Court of Justice to deal with, and all these aspects combined have led to the Commission presenting a proposal to change the existing directive.
The three main problems at the time were: the concept of insolvency, the placing of a time-limit on the guarantee and, particularly, insolvency cases with a cross-border dimension.
I have great admiration for those who have submitted the Commission proposals and who have tabled a few amendments following detailed discussions.
These mainly pertain to the new legal basis following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the clarification of the scope and the possible scrapping of the annexes in which quite a few groups are mentioned which can be excluded or not, as the case may be, the new definition of the term 'intervention' and especially the new provisions establishing the guarantee fund that covers cross-border cases.
In my view, it is important to revisit what I describe as the scope as a whole, for the question as to which categories could still be exempt is still subject to possible debate, especially in the field of domestic staff and the so-called share fishermen.
If I had my way, I would scrap this as a whole, as I have also said during the debate.
I think that the Commission would also be in favour of this, but a number of countries provide for exemption provisions, and we do not want to make life too difficult for them.
What we do consider important is that the Commission has meanwhile included a number of elements which were already being developed within this labour market, where, for example, part-time workers, workers with a temporary agency employment relationship, or workers with fixed-term contracts, are concerned via existing directives in these intervention directives.
Since we are as yet unsure about the implications of this, we have to point out - as have many, as will be clear in a moment - that these days, there are an ever increasing number of categories of self-employed, including the quasi self-employed as they are referred to by some, without staff, with staff who would or would not qualify, and then especially those without staff.
Those with staff are, in fact, employers.
In addition, we still have categories of home workers - mind the translation in this case - because it literally means those working from home, and this could well be the topic of a number of discussions.
In fact, it would also be very useful if some progress were made in the legislative work in line with the discussion in the framework of the social dialogue on modernising labour relations, and that is why we made a number of proposals that are now before you.
In this connection, I would therefore ask my fellow MEPs to back amendments which pertain to the self-employed without staff, so as to open the debate with the Council in any case.
I should like to point out that what is at issue is a codecision procedure and that we will be entering into negotiations after second reading in order to be able to take a step forward in the field of social security and social policy in Europe.
Madam President, it is a little odd that I should have to take the floor on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, but that is because Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, who has written the opinion for Mr Bouwman' s report - on which I should like to congratulate him warmly - is unable to attend due to a change in schedule.
I can, in fact, be relatively brief about the opinion.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has particularly attempted to underline the legal aspects of this directive.
A number of elements have been adopted, while a number of other elements have not been adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
In any case, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market deems it extremely important for the opinion to be thought-out well.
That is why it is also important to return it to the committee, so that it can re-examined very carefully.
That also - and perhaps mainly - applies to the position of the self-employed.
Indeed, I welcome the fact that the self-employed fall within its scope, at least the self-employed who can be compared to employees.
However, there is, of course, the risk that we give people who we actually do not want to fall within the scope of this definition at all, a tremendous opportunity, turning them into a kind of preferred creditor in a bankruptcy.
I am not certain whether in the texts as they are worded now, sufficient distinction is being drawn between the two situations, in fact.
That is a problem that will require further examination, also in terms of the position of the self-employed.

Madam President, Commissioner, before I start my speech I would like to inform Mr Bouwman that the company he was referring to is the Sintel company, which went bankrupt, forcing unemployment on a large number of its employees.
However, several months ago the Spanish Government took on the responsibility of making backdated wage payments to Sintel' s employees, relocating or finding other such solutions for all those affected.
I say this so that you may be fully informed, Mr Bouwman.
Now I will move on to my speech on this report.
The document we are debating refers to the proposal for amending Directive 80/987/EEC on the approximation of national laws relating to the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.
Mr Bouwman has, in fact, given a very clear example of this situation.
The amendment aims to take into account changes to insolvency law in Member States and the need for consistency with other Community directives on labour law already adopted.
All of this should be based on a political will to provide employees with a minimum degree of protection under Community law in the event of their employer becoming insolvent.
The difficulties involved in achieving the intended objective of the Directive are, in my opinion, threefold: firstly, the concept of insolvency; secondly, the complexity of the arrangement introduced to allow a time and quantity limits to be placed on the guarantee; thirdly, insolvency cases with a cross-border dimension.
With the aim of clarifying the situation, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has once again tabled two amendments: No 16, which includes cases of externalisation or similar, subcontracts, the 'fake self-employed' , etc., all of which could conceal a true employment contract.
In our opinion, we need to reveal the truth before protective methods are implemented, to protect the salaried employee.
To not do this would be to open the floodgates which would quickly exhaust the fund in question.
Amendment No 17 clarifies the notion of protectable earnings from the corresponding national fund and prevents fraud.
All of this is inherent to the protective nature of labour legislation and is inspired by the desire to clearly define the concepts needed for the fund to serve its purpose.
This is a clarification of ideas which aids progress towards legal certainty and harmonisation.
Regrettably, this is a case which, as we have recently witnessed with another Belgian company, is taking place in large companies, due to the restructuring of these companies and the relations which currently exist in the economic world.
Madam President, I do not know whether this afternoon was the first time that you have been in the chair, presiding over Parliament.
If it is, congratulations.
I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his exceptionally good report and sound preparations for this dossier.
I fear that in the current climate, the report is indeed very topical and that this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.
All the more reason for ensuring that we protect those employees who are faced with bankruptcy and suspension of payment.
That is the rationale underlying the preparations for this report.
I am also pleased that we in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have reached overwhelming agreement.
There are a few loose ends that need tying up, a few points on which we do not yet see eye to eye completely.
A moment ago, I heard Mr Pronk say that it is indeed possible that there are still a number of misunderstandings concerning amendments.
I am thinking in particular of the point he made, namely the fact that on the one hand, we also want a number of self-employed, notably self-employed who are very much like employees, to fall within the scope of the regulation, but on the other hand, this should not open the floodgates to mutual aid between employers and service providers who would be able to use those funds.
We are agreed on the intention.
We should use the time we now have until the actual vote to consider whether those misunderstandings can be removed and whether this joint intention can be expressed in a compromise amendment.
In my view, the point about the self-employed is a very important one, particularly in this dossier.
However, it also crops up in a number of other dossiers.
That is why I should like to draw the Commissioner' s attention to this point and ask him whether the Commission could show some more initiative both on this matter and on the matter of defining which categories should in fact be comparable with employees.
This is not only of paramount importance for the issue of insolvency, of course, but also for a lot of other aspects of employment protection and labour law.
Those definitions in European law are still left for the Member States to deal with.
We have noticed that there are rather considerable discrepancies between them.
As cross-border employment increases, and this will become ever more popular in the European Union, it will mean that we will be increasingly faced with different definitions and different groups which will cause disruption to labour market relations.
Enlargement in particular is a huge cause for concern, as we have already witnessed in the past and are witnessing at the moment in the EU' s border regions.
I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner what initiatives she intends to take on this score and urge her to adopt a pro-active stance on this.
Madam President, my congratulations to the rapporteur on a job well done, together with my thanks for his help in ensuring that the amendments needed to the overall endeavour were accepted.
The amendments to this directive follow on from amendments to two other directives relating to mass redundancies and company transfers, the common objective of all of which is to protect workers' interests when companies are restructured and we must not forget this.
They therefore ipso facto raise the question of coordinating the common concepts used and I think that we need to pay attention to this when the amendments are finalised.
Secondly, this directive also fails to address the question of communitising the definition of salaries.
Despite the difficulties inherent in this endeavour, the Fifteen need to adopt a minimum common definition of the concept of employee if the directive is to be applied uniformly.
Otherwise, every country, depending on whether it has a broader or narrower understanding of the concept, will differentiate the scope of the directive as it sees fit.
We need to tread carefully on this point.
The proposed amendments, which I too support, include extending the scope of the directive to employees under what qualify as "implied" contracts in national legislation.
If we are not mature enough to extend the directive to the self-employed, we could at least extend the scope of the directive to employees who are self-employed but who are treated as employees under special legislation.
Secondly, this amendment is an inclusion in the sense of covered claims and severance pay, as provided for in International Labour Convention No. 173, and I fail to see why we cannot cover them in Europe.
Thirdly, it is the clearest redefinition of the meaning of insolvency so as to include any collective insolvency proceedings and not just traditional bankruptcy proceedings.
In any case it is also in the objectives of the directive and has not approximated any formulation.
The House would be well advised to approve these three amendments.
Madam President, I welcome the favourable reception that the Commission proposal has received and I would like to thank Parliament for its contributions aimed at further reinforcing the protection of workers affected by the insolvency of their employer.
The Insolvency Directive has proved to be an invaluable instrument for protecting employees in cases of economic downturns and it will be a key legislative instrument to respond to the present climate of closures and redundancies.
Although the basic structure of the directive should be retained, specific points of the directive need to be revised.
I welcome Amendment No 2 which aims to prevent the introduction of new restrictions beyond those currently in place in the Member States, and also Amendment No 9 which proposes to prohibit threshold provisions in order to qualify for claims under the directive.
I am also in favour of Amendment No 4 which proposes to extend the protection of workers of employers in other insolvency situations beyond those situations covered by the definition of insolvency proposed by the Commission.
Firstly, the broadening of the definition is fully acceptable.
However, on Amendment No 6, the extension to any other procedure or even to "de facto" situations of insolvency can only be accepted as an option for the Member States and not as an obligation.
I can also accept Amendment No 11, which proposes to add severance pay on termination of the employment relationship, with the addition of the term "where appropriate".
The term "pay" should continue to be defined in the national law of the Member States.
Amendment No 14, which proposes the abolition of a ceiling, is not acceptable in its entirety but I share your concerns on this point and I could accept a provision which allows ceilings which are compatible with the social purpose of the directive in order to avoid a level which is unacceptable for workers.
I am also ready to supplement this provision with a non-regression clause which impedes Member States from lowering the protection already provided when implementing the amended directive.
Finally, I can accept the reintroduction of the old Article 5 of the directive - Amendment No 15 - but this only in the old unchanged version of this article in the 1980 directive.
I am unable to accept the remaining amendments, in particular Amendment No 13 which aims to increase the minimum period for pay to six months.
Such an increase would seriously reduce the chance of the directive being adopted and would place a further considerable financial burden on the public purse and employers which would in turn cast doubt on the system of pay guarantees as a whole.
I cannot accept Amendment No 1, which aims to prevent employees from being "converted" to self-employed persons; Amendment No 7 which proposes the introduction of a Community definition of "employee"; nor Amendments Nos 8 and 16 which propose to add categories of workers who may not be excluded from the scope of the directive.
Efforts to combat illegal "conversion" must be made at national level.
A Community definition of an employed person should not be included in a particular directive, and self-employed workers cannot be covered because they do not have an employer who could be insolvent.
In line with your comments I agree that there are different types of self-employed people.
There are some self-employed people who are economically dependent.
This issue was raised in 2000 when we had consultation with the social partners.
The responses of the social partners emphasised the need to clarify and analyse the situation in all Member States because there is a diversity of situations, there are many different kinds of self-employed people.
This was the reason why we have already launched a study which will provide us with an overview of the nature of the phenomenon across the European Union.
Once we have the results of the study, the Commission will analyse it and after a consultation with the social partners we will present the appropriate way to deal with this issue.
The other categories - home-workers and those in similar categories - are covered to the extent that they are considered to be employees under national law.
There is, therefore, no need to mention them specifically.
Finally, some amendments should be rejected because they would not help to achieve the underlying objective of the proposal.
To sum up, I can accept, subject to some minor redrafting, Amendments Nos 2, 4, 6, 9, and 11, and parts of Amendments Nos 14 and 15.
I reject Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17 and 18.
I would like to thank you for your contribution. I would particularly like to thank and congratulate Mr Bouwman for his contribution and for the report.
The vote was postponed a moment ago, just before the debate started.
You will hear in due course when this will take place.
The debate is now closed.
I thank you.
Oh, I am sorry, Mr Bouwman.
I should briefly like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Vice-President of this meeting at the end of the debate of her first report as Vice-President.
Thank you very much.
It was a pleasure to start off with a Dutch rapporteur.
The next item is the report by Mr Nobilia on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on new European labour markets, open to all, with access for all.
New European labour markets
Madam President, on behalf of my colleague, Mr Nobilia who is not present and on behalf of my Group, I wish to invoke Rule 146 and ask the House to postpone this debate until the December part-session.
Mr Nobilia has tried various other means to have the debate postponed but, unfortunately, Parliament' s Rules of Procedure do not permit this. We therefore, have no option but to ask the House, pursuant to Rule 146, as I said, to grant a postponement until December - of both the debate and the vote.
Mr Ribeiro, I have taken note of your request.
I should now like to give the floor to a speaker who would like to speak in favour of this request.
Mr Pronk, you have one minute.
Madam President, allow me to add my congratulations on your first debate in which so many Dutch people have taken the floor.
This sentiment is also shared by the Christian Democratic Appeal as the largest delegation in the largest group.
The request is logical in my view.
The matter has been reassigned, something which Mr Nobilia was not aware of.
It is an important report and it seems that we are doing the right thing.
I do not believe that this is the right time to conduct a proper debate, nor is this the right way.
We have to postpone it.
It is not necessary to reach a vote at all cost today.
That is why we support this request.
Topical and urgent debate
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
Accident in the Gotthard Tunnel
We shall start with the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0710/2001 by Mrs Wallis, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte and Mr Caveri, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the accident in the Saint Gotthard tunnel;
B5-0718/2001 by Mrs Isler Béguin and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the accident in the Saint Gotthard tunnel;
B5-0724/2001, by Mr Simpson and Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the accident in the Saint Gotthard tunnel;
B5-0725/2001 by Mrs Ainardi and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the accident in the Saint Gotthard tunnel;
B5-0734/2001 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the accident in the Saint Gotthard tunnel.
Mr President, the very recent and all too familiar disasters that have taken place in the Mont Blanc and Gotthard tunnels reveal the terrible truth about Europe' s current transport policy.
And in this case, revealing the truth can only lead to condemnation.
The world of road transport seems to have broken free from any legal framework, from any control standards.
Freight companies exempt themselves from having operating permits, work permits are becoming optional for drivers who increasingly come from outside the Union, when their driving times verge on the limit and when they themselves verge on sleep.
How many more Gotthards and Mont Blancs must go up in flames before they are covered by strict legislation, by an effective system of controls which is both harmonised and trans-European?
The residents of all sensitive or high-density areas and all professionals are calling for Europe to intervene and the matter is of the greatest urgency.
The most sensible course of action would now be to set up safety escorts for convoys of lorries in every major tunnel.
Until this first safety measure is put in place, lives will still be in danger when these two accident-stricken tunnels are reopened.
We must no longer be asked to show patience over this harmonisation of safety standards for tunnels. Instead, the finger must be clearly pointed and this political nervousness, this lack of commitment on the part of public authorities to the costly but necessary restructuring of underground tunnels must be condemned.
Although a review of practices in the road transport sector is required, an in-depth discussion of our transport policy is no less needed.
The tragedies that have taken place in these tunnels demonstrate the physical and ideological shortcomings of the 'everything by road' approach, which clogs up transport links and chokes the environment.
Let us open up our eyes, then, and cast off the blinkers that force us to see only roads, and we will finally see the entire European network of stations and railway lines that are almost completely overlooked in terms of providing piggyback transport.
We will see that some ports, such as those in Italy, offer transit options that are likely to reduce traffic considerably on the road links of European trade.
The memory of the victims of Gotthard and Mont Blanc must inspire us to adopt a new approach, one that is more forward looking and more respectful of our means of transport.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you will recall, in the last Strasbourg week we had actually planned to have a debate to celebrate the opening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel.
In fact even then we were already discussing the tragic accident in the Gotthard Tunnel.
If we continue just to talk about this and do not take any measures then we will have to be prepared for the fact that there will be more accidents in these delicate and sensitive areas, in particular in the Alps.
However, in my opinion, and on the basis of my understanding of politics, this is unacceptable.
That is why we must do all we can to actually implement the proposals which the Commission has already rightly made in its White Paper.
I have no doubt that specific safety measures are also needed in the tunnels.
I have no doubt that stricter monitoring of working time, above all, is also required.
I hope that we will soon conclude the conciliation on this and that we will then move on to implementing and monitoring the measures on working time across Europe.
However, the fundamental problem is surely that there is too much freight rumbling through the Alps by road in heavy goods vehicles.
This is certainly not - as time and again it is wrongly assumed, appealing to popular sentiment - about standing in the way of economic links and cohesion; it is simply about this cohesion, these economic links and trade in general being created in a way which firstly is environmentally sustainable and secondly minimises the risk of accidents.
We will never be able to avoid them altogether, but we can minimise them and in so doing we can also above all give the railways a golden opportunity.
I - and I myself have also produced a report on opening up international freight routes - am in favour of the railways being stronger competitors here.
At the same time, I am however, on behalf of my group, also in favour of the transport policy, as postulated and laid down in the White Paper - I will say this once more in conclusion - being implemented quickly, in fact very quickly indeed, so that steps can be taken as soon as possible to avoid there being more accidents like the one in the Gotthard Tunnel.
Who could possibly be against the content of this motion for a resolution when, following the Mont Blanc tragedy, a tunnel has, once again, caused loss of life?
Parliament will, most likely, vote in favour of the resolution.
We will move down the agenda and things will continue as before, because calling for an integrated transport policy for the whole of the Alpine region in one resolution is not enough to ensure that it is actually implemented.
There must be a genuine rethink of transport policy at European level.
There must be the political will to confront the road transport lobby and, above all, there must be investment to develop rail networks to meet the needs of everyone, not just to make profit.
This would require a radical break with your policy of privatisation and of dismantling public services.
Furthermore, the organisation of goods transport is inseparable from the global economic system.
The development, for example, of the zero stock system, which is highly profitable for private interests, is an aberration from the social point of view, because it is responsible, to a large extent, for clogging up the roads.
Giving priority to private interests, therefore, is bound to conflict with the general interest.
This motion for a resolution, for which we will be voting, will just be added to the long wish list that the European Parliament is continually producing.
Mr President, it seems to be fate. On the final day of the last part-session - 24 October 2001 - we were discussing the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel.
There was a bit of an argument - some were in favour, such as yours truly, and some wanted to put back the date of this major event.
Suddenly, into the middle of the debate came the news of the other incident in the St Gotthard tunnel, an unforeseen incident similar to that which had occurred in the Mont Blanc tunnel and which we had thought would now never be repeated.
Those in favour of opening the Mont Blanc tunnel to traffic immediately were once again advocating this line of action on health grounds, basing their argument particularly on a document produced by the operating company, which, pompously - and maybe rightly - stated that the Mont Blanc tunnel, rebuilt after the accident, is now the safest in the world.
I remember announcements, official pronouncements, so to speak, describing the St Gotthard tunnel as the most important tunnel certainly in Europe if not in the world.
Now we know that a very run-of-the-mill accident was enough in the past, is enough now and will be enough in future to turn these megasafe tunnels into people traps, and the many victims always pay with their lives.
It is difficult to apportion blame for these incidents; moreover, that is not for us to do.
However, one statistic does need to be mentioned here, for it concerns something for which we and, in particular, the Commission are responsible.
Indeed, considering that five times as many vehicles pass through the St Gotthard tunnel as usually run on all the other major routes through the Alps, we are faced with a transport policy error, and that is partly the fault of Europe, for most of the vehicles, particularly the heavy goods vehicles, are European.
I would therefore put two questions to the Commission.
What has happened to the directive on harmonising the minimum safety requirements for road and rail tunnels?
And I would ask the Commission, what has happened to the action plan for an integrated transport policy in the Alpine region?
When the answers have been given to these two questions, we can proceed to the usual road versus rail argument.
Lastly, Mr President, I do not agree that heavy goods vehicles should be banned from using the tunnel.
Road haulage contractors have a right of passage and a right to provide a service as well.
Mr President, the dramatic repercussions of the accident in the St Gotthard tunnel, especially after the equally tragic repercussions in the Mont Blanc and Val Thorens tunnels, have put the issue of tunnel safety right at the top of the agenda.
We need to push ahead on two fronts at European level. First, we need enhanced specifications and, secondly, we need to support motorrail services through the Alps.
The Commission announced in the White Paper referred to by almost all the members that it intends to propose European regulations setting out minimum safety standards for tunnels.
These standards will apply to technical equipment, traffic regulations, user information, training for staff operating the tunnels, for staff dealing with accidents when problems arise and for rescue services.
It is a complicated endeavour which needs to take account of a plethora of different parameters, given the extent to which one tunnel differs from another in terms of geography, size and traffic density.
At present, the Commission is carrying out pre-preparatory work with the help of first-class experts, with a view to submitting a proposal to Parliament at the beginning of 2002.
In the meantime, it also intends to convene a meeting of political and economic agencies operating in the Alps and the Pyrenees.
Of course, even the best legislative proposals are no good unless they are adopted and applied.
And as regards the safety of tunnels in particular, I should like to remind the House of other proposals which have yet to be adopted.
I should like to remind the House of the proposal to introduce digital tachographs which allow the time spent on the road by lorry drivers to be controlled accurately and which several Member States have opposed.
Or the Commission proposal on working conditions for lorry drivers, which Mr Swoboda has already referred to.
Then there is the question of certifying professional drivers and the question of small lorries which constantly exceed the 90 kilometre limit and have become accidents waiting to happen on the majority of roads in most Member States.
The fire in this tunnel also illustrates the need for information for tunnel users.
It is clear that, had users been informed, many could have escaped via the emergency exit or by getting out of their cars immediately.
And, of course, this particular accident again raises the question of freight transport through the Alps.
The absolute priority, in the medium term, is to provide rail links to alleviate freight transport with motorrail services as quickly as possible and this is one of the major priorities in the White Paper.
In the period between 1994 and 2000, the European Commission funded studies into the implementation of the new Lyon-Turin rail link. So far 60 million has been spent, about 50% of the total cost.
This project, in which the Community is, to date, indisputably the biggest provider of funds, is one of 14 projects approved by the European Union Council in Essen in 1994 which, unfortunately, it will not be possible to complete before 2010.
The Brenner rail route also needs to be commissioned as quickly as possible, in accordance with the 1996 guidelines on the western European transport network.
So what can be done in the short term following the problem created by the closure of the St Gotthard tunnel? Immediate use should be made of motorrail facilities in the Alps.
This accident, and its dramatic repercussions, are yet another reason to make every possible effort to shift freight from the roads to the railways, a mode of transport which only accounts for 8% of the market in Europe, compared with 40% in the United States.
The European Commission has also taken new initiatives.
In January 2001, it proposed that the Council sign the transport protocol annexed to the Alpine Convention on behalf of the European Commission, as a political message on restoring the balance of distribution between the various modes of transport.
Because of difficulty in funding these projects, the White Paper proposes Community legislation laying down fairer pricing principles which take account of all the costs incurred for each mode of transport, together with safety costs.
To conclude, the Commission has taken or intends to take various specific measures in order to resolve the particular problems besetting the Pyrenees, the Alps and other sensitive areas.
And I can assure you that it will make every effort to guarantee users the highest possible safety standards.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
That concludes the joint debate.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
Massacre of 200 civilians in the Federal Republic of Nigeria
B5-0711/2001 by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne and Mr Van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the human rights situation in Nigeria;
B5-0712/2001 by Mr Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the human rights situation in Nigeria;
B5-0713/2001 by Mr Bowis, Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Deva, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the incidents of 22 October in the State of Benue, Central Nigeria;
B5-0720/2001 by Mr Swoboda and Mr Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the massacre of civilians in Nigeria;
B5-0726/2001 by Mrs Morgantini and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the human rights situation in Nigeria;
B5-0732/2001 by Mrs Maes, Mrs McKenna and Mr Rod, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the human rights situation in Nigeria;
B5-0735/2001 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the incidents in the State of Benue, Nigeria.
In order to achieve world peace, it is essential for people of different creeds and races to respect each other and live together in peace.
This is not the case in an increasing number of countries in the world, and that is an extremely worrying trend.
Unfortunately, Nigeria is an alarming case in point.
Precious little is left of the hopes which the democratically elected president had raised as successor of the corrupt military regime.
Ethnic and religious feuds are now the order of the day across the country.
Not a month goes by without blood being shed. The number of casualties is running into the hundreds and the situation is getting worse, not better.
In that light, the balance sheet for October is shocking.
There was fighting between Muslims and Christians in Jos and disturbances in Kano where, moreover, there has been a cholera outbreak.
The government army carried out ethnic atrocities and massacres in the Middle Belt.
The government itself was shrouded in silence.
Only after two weeks did President Obasanjo announce that a special committee would investigate the murders.
The billion-dollar question is whether the president is actually up to the task of running this country which is extremely difficult to govern.
Apparently, his position is not strong enough in order to keep the country united and allow the different nations to live together peacefully.
It is frightening.
Just now when we are nearly free of the Taliban, we are lumbered with regions such as the north of Nigeria, where the shari' ah is introduced.
Autonomy for those regions should not go as far as observing their own rules that are diametrically opposed to national legislation and that suppress the population and women, in particular.
To sentence a pregnant woman to capital punishment for having intercourse before marriage is barbaric.
My question to the Commission is: What can the European Union do?
In any event, the dialogue with Nigeria will need to be intensified.
However, Europe' s hands are tied if the president and the government themselves lack the courage to act and to do everything in their power to allow the Nigerians to live together in peace.
Mr President, two years ago, following fair elections in the multi-cultural and multi-ethnic state of Nigeria, the military dictatorship was replaced by a parliamentary democracy.
However, veteran President Olusugun Obasanjo is increasingly facing the difficult challenge of keeping riots under control between northern Muslims and Christian southerners, not infrequently culminating in gruesome blood baths.
For example, we were recently alarmed once again by a dubious military reprisal in the federal state of Benue.
I notice with some discomposure that the army seems to be taking the law into its own hands in various cases.
It is understandable that the Tivs, associated with the South, are very suspicious of the fact that the army was siding with the northern-oriented Jukuns, the population group to which the current Defence Minister belongs.
It is of the utmost importance for the military forces to act within the constitutional mandate and ensure the safety of all citizens.
Increasing tension in the Middle Belt has at the same time illustrated my growing concern for the ever-widening chasm between religions that is fanning out towards the middle and south of the country.
In a personal meeting with his American opposite number, President Bush less than two weeks ago, President Obasanja reassured President Bush once again of his support for the International Coalition against terrorism. On that same fateful Friday, 2 November, however, as the representative of the thirteenth federal state incorporating Islamic penal law, he was also faced with implementing the decree in Kaduna to introduce Islamic penal law, the shari'ah.
This will do nothing to promote the peaceful coexistence of Muslims and the large Christian minority in that state.
Finally, I should like to express my emphatic support for the attempts by the Nigerian President and parliament to look into, and tackle, the causes of the continuing ethnic and religious conflicts, to which, inter alia, Paragraph 4 of the resolution refers.
I would ask the Council and Commission to contribute according to their means.
Mr President, those of us who were in Abuja and Kano last year for the ACP meeting welcomed President Obasanjo's move from military dictatorship to democracy.
We were also aware of the simmering tension in the country, particularly in the north, with outbreaks of violence.
Sharia law has been a potent symbol of the cause of that tension, demanded by some Muslims, feared by most Christians and other faiths; partly the result of northern Nigeria not benefiting from independence and oil as the south has done, and a resentment of corruption that they see as chronic in the country.
Thousands have died as a result of violence, especially in Kaduna and many Christian homes, churches and businesses have been destroyed.
The Zanfara state government has given local vigilante groups the power to implement Sharia law.
In reply seventeen southern states have demanded the right to set up their own police forces.
Northerners are leaving Lagos after riots that have led to deaths.
In the north, journalists in Kano are threatened with Sharia law if they represent it in a negative way.
Now we see in Benue and Taraba in east and central Nigeria tribal, not religious, wars.
The Jukun and Tiv disputes are about land and ancient rivalries, not about religion.
Nineteen soldiers who were trying to keep the peace were abducted and murdered.
Then we saw the awful reprisals in which Zakibian, a town of 20 000 people, was destroyed and over 200 people killed.
Of course we welcome President Obasanjo's announcement of an inquiry.
Ethnic and religious violence must be stopped in Nigeria.
There must be equality before the law and not fear and violence.
Corruption from whatever source must be rooted out.
The European Union must support this.
It must also provide humanitarian support for Nigeria, where over 200 people have died of cholera in the last few weeks, and help the people who have been displaced as a result of this violence.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the events in and around Afghanistan have obscured our view of trouble spots in other parts of the world, for example in Nigeria.
The European Union should not, however, be indifferent to what is happening in this the most populous country in Africa.
At the beginning of this year, the President of Nigeria, President Obasanjo, declared that 2001 would be the year in which the Nigerian people would reap the rewards of the transition to democracy.
We supported this statement when we met at that time in Abuja in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
The trust has, however, suddenly turned to deep concern.
A split in the ruling party in Nigeria, the absence of economic improvements and the persistence of poor living conditions have made people increasingly willing to resort to violence, thus creating a breeding ground for political extremists.
To keep them in check, President Obasanjo felt it necessary to deploy soldiers in seven Nigerian states.
Since then more than 3 000 people are said to have been killed and there is renewed fear that the military might return to power.
The introduction and application of Sharia law in an increasing number of states has heightened religious and ethnic tensions.
Violent criminals often go unpunished.
The President and all of the forces of democracy in Nigeria are called upon to take determined action against violent criminals using the legal means at their disposal, to secure respect for universal human rights and to hurry through economic reforms which will benefit all parts of the country, if there is to be an end to this misery.
We expect the Commission to monitor this process actively and to do everything within its power to ensure that this trouble spot in Africa once again becomes a place of democracy.
Mr President, I am sure that, like me, when you call for a debate on the Democratic Republic of Nigeria, you know we are actually talking about a corrupt military oligarchy in an African country to which we give our support.
Nigeria is proof, Mr President, that the wealth and value of a nation are often measured according to the priority that it gives to human rights, and especially to women, children and workers.
Nigeria is the most densely populated country in Africa, which means that it has vast human resources.
It also has mineral resources and a high oil production that should protect its population from poverty.
Furthermore, its huge diversity could provide real dynamism.
And yet, for decades, a climate of violence towards democrats has been allowed to flourish there and Nigeria' s rulers have never truly sought to punish the extra-judicial murders and violence.
By not taking any preventive action, the military powers have allowed a climate of latent ethnic conflict to evolve and one of these conflicts, in the East of the country, pitting the Tivs and the Jukuns against one another, has just led to the deaths of 200 civilians, who were massacred by soldiers.
The most shocking aspect, Mr President, Commissioner, is that the State authorities are trying to play down this event by explaining that the soldiers involved in the massacre were reacting to the murder of some of their fellow militiamen.
In my view, we must, as we confirmed at the ACP summit on 1 November, force countries that legitimately claim to be our partners in dialogue, that we choose as partners and that request financial support from us, to comply with commonly accepted rules and with international conventions.
With regard to Nigeria, this would involve fighting the implementation of the Islamic sharia - a woman was allowed to be stoned in front of television cameras a few weeks ago and not a single country reacted.
At the same time, a climate of Islamophobia is developing, with mosques being burned down, and this too is met with widespread indifference.
Lastly, an independent inquiry must now be opened into the murders that took place in November 1999 and in October 2001.
We should be aware that our colleagues in the Nigerian parliament have called these massacres examples of 'ethnic cleansing' .
I wish to end by saying that I have often called in this House for the debts of third world countries to be cancelled, but this debt cancellation must be conditional, Mr President, on these countries truly respecting human rights, workers' rights and the rights of children and women.
We must no longer accept these countries calling themselves democratic and signing conventions, which they then fail to observe.
Mr President, between 22 and 24 October last, Nigerian soldiers raged among the people of Benue state.
Over 200 civilians were killed in this massacre and houses and market stalls were burned down.
There must be a swift, impartial, effective inquiry into these massacres.
The Nigerian Federal government must guarantee full respect for the Constitution and the rule of law without delay.
It is not doing so, despite the hopes placed in it.
The Nigerian army is incapable of restoring law and order; moreover, this is not its role.
Only a police force which respects human rights would be able to rebuild trust between the different communities.
It is the duty of the European Parliament to condemn these massacres, which come on top of religious intolerance and miscarriages of justice.
The way the sharia is currently being wrongly applied in Nigeria is a violation of fundamental human rights, especially the rights of women.
Neither European Union nor United Nations resolutions have acknowledged the escalation of the ethnic conflicts in Nigeria.
There is an urgent need for a humanitarian aid system to be established for displaced persons and refugees.
Lastly, the European Union should implement the procedure laid down by Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
Mr President, the murder of hundreds of members of the Benue community and the stoning of the pregnant woman in northern Nigeria highlight the desperate situation this country is in.
The European Commission is monitoring the situation within the framework of its powers and capabilities.
In May 2001, the Commission issued a common position making provision for political dialogue with Nigeria to be strengthened.
This common position is based on human rights and missions headed by European Union diplomats have been in contact with the Nigerian government.
One mission was concerned with the economic situation and the other with human rights and the problem of human rights and the need for the government to intervene and take action have been highlighted.
The government has acknowledged the problems and stressed that it intends to continue its efforts along these lines but I believe that parliament has also set limits on the potential for this particular government to intervene.
There are two points in the motions on which I should like to comment briefly.
The first is the education of the security forces in the human rights sector.
This is a new sector for the Community, which has come under military cooperation in the past.
However, the Community is currently supporting this sort of programme in Algeria, Guatemala, the Ukraine and the Palestinian territories.
The Commission is re-examining the potential for intervention in West Africa, Liberia and the Ivory Coast and, as far as Nigeria is concerned, the United Kingdom, France and the United States are involved in similar activities.
The Commission is monitoring the problems within the specific framework of human rights, but it cannot intervene in the education of security forces for human rights unless the Nigerian government asks it to do so.
As far as humanitarian aid is concerned, the European Commission is intervening wherever the national or local authorities are unable to deal with natural or man-made disasters, but only in countries which have asked for help from abroad.
So far, Nigeria has not asked for any help.
The local authorities are more or less coping with the problems arising mainly as the result of movements of the population within the country, but I must stress, as has already been said, that Nigeria's problems are of a seriously structural nature.
Short-term development aid is not enough to cope with them.
However, the Commission thinks it is important to monitor recent developments directly on the ground, which is why it is planning to despatch ECHO delegates to Nigeria to record the dangers already referred to.
Thank you very much Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Íatural disasters
Mr President, before beginning my two minutes of speaking time, and as a point of order, I would like to point out to the Presidency that there is an error in the transcribed text.
In paragraph four of the Resolution there is a phrase missing, literally 'which should be compatible with European Union doctrine on cooperation, respect for human rights and democracy' .
This was the text agreed by all of the groups according to a document given to the Presidency by the spokesperson for international relations from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
And now, Mr President, I would like to begin my allotted intervention by pointing out that this resolution aims to tackle the problem of the devastation caused by hurricane Michelle, which has particularly affected three countries: Honduras, Nicaragua and Cuba.
The effects of this disaster are exacerbated by the fact that the three countries in question have levels of poverty that I personally would call extreme.
Given that a simple reference was made in the resolution to our recent visit to Nicaragua, in order to provide illustrative evidence of the situation in this country, I would like to point out that Nicaragua is currently the poorest country in Continental America. Fifty per cent of Nicaraguans live in conditions of poverty and 17% in conditions of extreme poverty - to be poor in Nicaragua means living on USD 1 per month.
In macroeconomic terms, Nicaragua has foreign debt of USD 6 500 million, exports less than a third of what it imports and the country balances its payments and survives, ultimately, thanks to international aid and emigrants' remittances, particularly from the United States and Costa Rica.
With regard to the situation in Cuba, on another delegation visit, I think we all will agree that the situation of that country is extremely gloomy.
Cuba is currently surviving mostly thanks to emigrants' remittances and, secondly, tourism, which represent more than all other Cuban exports put together.
This being the case, what the resolution is aiming to achieve is, first and foremost, to show solidarity with the communities affected and with the human victims of the consequences of this hurricane.
Secondly, and I would like the Commissioner to take special note of this, I would like to express Parliament' s satisfaction with the actions of the Humanitarian Aid Office.
Thirdly, I would ask that, in the case of Honduras and Nicaragua, estimated damages be considered within the framework of the Regional Programme for the Reconstruction of Central America.
Given that we are talking about Nicaragua, there is an amendment tabled by the Socialist Group, and I would like to address the rapporteur here, which says that, as there have been misappropriations of funds - and we are referring to European funds here - certain action has to be taken.
I personally took the trouble to call the Commission delegation in Nicaragua.
I have a fax here in which they tell me that in no case has there been any proof, nor has there been any investigation into these funds, therefore it cannot be confirmed that there have been misappropriations.
During the recent visit we discovered that these accusations had occurred at the same time as an election campaign, but there was no judicial decision in this respect.
For this reason, it seems extremely reckless to me to make statements on this subject.
Mr President, with regard to Cuba, the phrase we have added can be interpreted by the various political parties as they see fit.
But when we say that we want a cooperation agreement to be reached in line with European doctrine, we mean to agree with what was stated in the Newens report and in the common position; that we will only reach a cooperation agreement when the Cuban regime makes significant progress in the improvement of respect for human rights and progresses towards a pluralist democracy.
This is the doctrine of the European Union, which is implicitly expressed in this resolution.
Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, we did not take into account the time taken up by your introduction so you have indeed spoken for three and a half minutes.
However, what you were saying was interesting. There is no need to worry at all.
I would just like to say that, three years after hurricane Mitch, Central America is once again being struck by the fresh tragedy of hurricane Michelle.
We must not forget that, since then, it has suffered an earthquake, drought and famine.
However, despite these disasters, democracy is slowly being established in these countries once again, and the European delegation, of which I am a member, which has just been to Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, is unanimously agreed on this point.
The proper running of the elections which have just taken place in Nicaragua is also evidence of this.
Therefore, I feel that we can be proud of the decisive role played by the European Union action in the development of democracy in these countries.
That is why I call for two measures: firstly, to increase the funds appropriated to the Programme for the Reconstruction of Central America, which currently amounts to EUR 250 million for the 1999-2002 period, since the latest disasters were not taken into consideration; and secondly, to review the European Union' s outdated position on Cuba.
Also totally devastated by the latest hurricane, the worst it has suffered for 50 years, Cuba is currently the only country in Central America which has not signed a cooperation agreement with the European Union, and its only hope in these times of trouble is humanitarian, emergency aid.
I could smile and tell you, with regard to Cuba, not to be more Catholic than the Pope, in the knowledge that he had no difficulty in identifying the right choice, but the appalling situation of this countries prevents me from smiling.
Rather, I will warn you not to focus on the wrong enemy.
The enemy is no longer communism: it is terrorism and terrorism thrives on destitution; democracy cannot be built on famine.
Cuba is an important, or rather essential part of the process of bringing integration and peace to Central America which is currently in progress.
Therefore, I urge the Council to instruct the Commission to reopen democratic cooperation negotiations with Cuba, insisting on total respect for European democratic values, which will not accept two different sets of values.
Mr President, it is quite sad that when we have these afternoons debating topical and urgent subjects of major importance, we almost always have to ask again for aid for catastrophes affecting the world' s poorest countries.
Both the delegation which, as Mr García Margallo said, visited Cuba and El Salvador, and the previous delegation that went to Honduras and Nicaragua, were able to see first hand the situation in which these countries find themselves, which, it must be said, is gloomy.
Nobody would say, however, that the situation in Cuba is gloomy; of course there are many problems that Cuba has to resolve, but these are nothing to be gloomy about, as anyone who has travelled to Cuba will tell you.
In any case, Mr President, I think we have to congratulate the European Commission for their speedy reaction to this catastrophe.
We also have to acknowledge the fact that in Cuba there have not been so many victims thanks to the very quick reaction and very good organisation of the public authorities serving both the general public and tourists.
Several Spanish tourists said on TV that they had been looked after very well during this situation of emergency.
I was very happy that the last phrase from paragraph 4 had been removed, which is a last minute amendment. For the fact that there should be a common position that prevents there being a normal relationship with Cuba, as there is with other countries, is regretted by non-governmental organisations, the church, representatives of the European Union, and even dissidents.
It is quite a sad matter for the European Union that Cuba is the only country in Latin America with which there is no cooperation agreement.
We are aware that when a resolution such as this one is approved in this House, it has to be done by a majority.
If it is true that there was agreement on that phrase being included, then it should be; but, naturally, it is regrettable that there is no cooperation agreement with Cuba, because what is required from this country should be the same as for all the others.
Yesterday we debated this issue and we saw that neither Turkey nor Morocco nor a large number of countries in Latin America have been asked to implement measures before an agreement can be reached.
We have only asked this of Cuba.
This is the difference, and it was made clear in this House, Mr President.
For this reason, if the phrase has to be included, then include it, but it is regrettable that it is only Cuba which is required to fulfil these conditions.
Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I too would like to express our solidarity with the people of Honduras, Nicaragua and Cuba, whose countries have been tragically devastated by the effects of hurricane Michelle.
Along with Iris, on 8 October, and Mitch, which we have not forgotten, this hurricane is one of a long list of natural disasters which regularly affect areas which are already suffering, adding tragedy to poverty.
These disasters, termed natural disasters, are a further reminder that climate change and non-sustainable development exacerbate the already substantial devastation and will continue to do so in the future.
Although the European Union is to be congratulated on the aid it is sending to Honduras and Nicaragua, it must be noted that Cuba is totally excluded from this demonstration of solidarity.
Cuba, which has suffered its worst disaster in 50 years, is unable to receive our help, for it is the only country in Latin and Central America which does not have a cooperation agreement with the European Union.
This situation is no longer appropriate: it is our duty to restate the need for a cooperation agreement focusing on environmentally sustainable development to be signed with Cuba without delay, and to review the European Union' s position.
We advocate equal treatment for all countries, and Cuba is certainly not benefiting from the same treatment as other countries.
Moreover, the American embargo on relations with the island is preventing it from buying the food and medical supplies so desperately needed by the people of Cuba.
The pharmacies are empty and there is a shortage of everything in the hospitals.
We cannot tolerate a situation which deprives an entire people of the aid received by neighbouring countries which have suffered the same disasters.
In order to change this, we must also support the call for the embargo against Cuba to be lifted.
Mr President, our initial reaction is to express our sincere condolences to the families of the victims and their countrymen, but we must also immediately re-state our commitment to show solidarity with the affected countries, taking care that this solidarity is shown through immediate, generous and effective action.
The principal role was initially taken by our own European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) and it appears that the Commission acted with the necessary speed by means of this office.
But the action of the European Union should not stop at this point and we should make a significant contribution to the reconstruction of everything which has been destroyed or damaged by Hurricane Michelle.
A large proportion of our efforts will be included within the Reconstruction Plan for Central America and within the framework of the Union' s agreements with Honduras and with Nicaragua.
This is where we fall down, due to the pitiful lack of a similar agreement with the Republic of Cuba. This is something that we are continually denouncing here in this House.
It makes no sense that Cuba, for whom, amongst other things, the Member States of the European Union include their main economic, commercial and tourism partners, should be the only country in Latin America with which the European Union has not signed a cooperation agreement.
For this reason, at the present time, the European Union is restricted to acting almost exclusively within the field of humanitarian and emergency aid.
We in this House would ask the Commission to show a high degree of flexibility when considering the suitability of projects which, in addition to this type of aid, also contribute to surmounting the damage and helping with the reconstruction of those sectors that have been most affected on the island by the effects of the hurricane.
It is vital that we revise the European Union' s common position on Cuba, which today is obsolete and even counterproductive, with a view to achieving the objectives that should have been pursued in 1996 when it was established, that is to say, the progress and prosperity of the Cuban people.
I would also have preferred that the paragraph added by the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats had requested the same from Cuba as is requested from other countries with which the European Union cooperates.
In any case, I do not think that the situation in Cuba is as gloomy as those who are determined to criticise that country would have us believe.
Mr President, we hope that the dialogue, without preconditions and without the exclusion of any particular subject from the agenda, that appears to have been re-initiated with the meeting this Monday in New York between the President of the Council and the Cuban Chancellor, will soon bear fruit and led to the signing of a cooperation treaty that will benefit Cuba and that will allow the European Union to act under normal conditions, with a greater degree of efficiency and with more influence in their relations with this country.
Floods in Algeria
Mr President, Algeria has been a troubled country for many years.
Its reputation and image abroad has been damaged by the violence, massacres and abuses of human rights there, but that is nothing compared with the pain and suffering of its people at home.
One million people died in the fight for independence and another 100 000 have died in the current power struggles between Islamic militants and the military and among the minority Berber community seeking political and cultural recognition.
Now in this country, four fifths of which - ironically - is Saharan desert, we have the catastrophe of flooding in Algiers with the death toll in flash floods rising towards 1 000 as the grim task of sifting through the mud and the rubble goes on.
It is not the first such calamity. In 1994, 30 000 people were made homeless in the Tindouf area, but the difference is that on that occasion seven lives were lost, while this time 693 people have already died and over 300 people are missing, with some 20 000 people thought to be homeless.
The urgency now is for the European Union to play its part in providing humanitarian aid.
There is a clear need for shelter, for food, for medical supplies and I certainly welcome the EUR 750 000 which has been given for this purpose under the ECHO fund, and indeed the promised EUR 225 million from the European Investment Bank for drinking water supply lines.
There is also a need for adequate heavy equipment to deal with situations like this and even picks and shovels seem to be in short supply.
Certainly no sniffer dogs appear to be available.
Given Algeria's position in an earthquake area it would certainly be prudent to have such things available for the future.
I would like to hear from the Commission what proposals it has to deal with this.
There is also the need to look at the policy of sealing the floodwater drains against terrorist activities, which in this case has clearly exacerbated the situation.
Mr President, we are aghast at the large numbers who have fallen victim to these disastrous floods and I believe that it is the duty of the European Union, of the individual Member States and of the Commission to do all that we can now to give assistance to those affected and help them through this difficult time.
Even though Algeria is further south than our homelands, we know that it can be cold and very wet in winter.
That is why aid is absolutely essential and everything that can be done to reduce the suffering must be done, and it must be done unconditionally.
This does not mean that we will not hope that something good will nevertheless come out of this terrible catastrophe and out of our provision of aid, namely that Algeria will find a way to really step up the necessary dialogue with those who want peace and freedom in that country.
The sacrifices which have been made in Algeria, not only during the war against their colonial masters but also in recent years and months, are horrendous.
The acts are horrendous, and it is high time that the government and the president of this country found a way out of the crisis.
Expectations were high when Bouteflika was elected President, but there have also been many disappointments in recent months: disappointment that more is said than done; disappointment that the people are addressed ex cathedra and not consulted.
The tragic events in Kabylia - a commission in Algeria itself investigated them and uncovered their causes, amongst other things - should be reason enough to change the dynamics of communication and political relations in Algeria.
In the case of the unrest in Kabylia - which, of course, then spread to the whole country or to wide areas of it - it was simply not true that it was started by a handful of anarchists and others who were following foreign orders: the Algerian commission itself established that it was above all the inappropriate behaviour of the security forces which was responsible.
That is why the tragic events of the last few days should also be seen as an opportunity in Algeria to try to pursue a different policy, a policy which consists of offering the people more opportunities and more chances, including economic and social ones.
Mr President, as Mr Swoboda stated, Algeria has already seen a great deal of suffering with the continual deaths in the country, more often than not of innocent people, and also with the poverty that is devastating part of the population.
Therefore, this catastrophe has only made this situation worse, with more than 600 victims, as has been stated, and with more than 20 000 people who have lost any standard of living they may have had.
Also, in this case, the resolution congratulates the European Commission on its speedy reaction, but special emergency aid will probably be necessary.
It is true that the European Parliament colegislates the budget with the Council, and, therefore, the result is what we achieve together, I know, but I am filled with sorrow - especially on these afternoons when we have to talk about so many catastrophes - that there is no sufficient budget heading that can be used in such cases, because we always find ourselves having to beg for, or to transfer some money from elsewhere to deal with these tragedies.
In the specific case of the resolution, the European Commission has also been asked if it could send experts and technicians to help evaluate the damage and find a way to rebuild what has been destroyed.
I know that we ask a great deal of the European Commission, but it is also true to say that the European Parliament is very sensitive to the situation in countries in Central America - as stated previously - as it is with countries in the Mediterranean.
We have to ask - and ask ourselves - as was stated the other day in the Committee on Development and Cooperation when talking about the reconstruction of Afghanistan (after having first destroyed it), that that reconstruction should not be the cause of a reduction in the funds available for Mediterranean countries, countries in Latin America and Africa, who also really have great need of them.
Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my full solidarity and the solidarity of my group with the people of Algeria, which has once again been struck by a huge disaster.
We who support the Algerian people, particularly in their fight for independence, are shocked by the tragic consequences of the floods in that country.
Material and, above all, human loss are jeopardising the country' s development and preserving its excessive structural and political shortcomings.
This disaster reveals once again the incompetence of the Algerian government: the way it builds houses and roads in flood plains and decides to block drains allegedly for safety reasons is proof of the utter irresponsibility of its leaders, and this is on top of the corruption and misuse of funds.
The government has failed in its primary mission of serving the general interests of the people.
It has done nothing to meet the needs of the people or ensure their safety.
Therefore, we must call upon the Algerian authorities to make good their past mistakes.
This situation must on no account be allowed to occur again either in Algeria or elsewhere.
We must no longer allow citizens' lives to be endangered by irresponsible, self-interested or reprehensible behaviour.
Mr President, some people may wonder why we are devoting time to discussing flooding - even flooding on this scale - in Algeria.
In fact a debate is currently raging about this idea of concern.
Recently, at a large meeting in Nuremberg, a leading German Orientalist complained that in parts of the Islamic world people were not concerned enough about the atrocious events in New York.
At the time I replied that we too have shown very little concern about Chechnya, where over 100 000 people have been murdered, or Iraq, where over 100 000 people, mainly children, have starved to death.
In fact there is a kind of partial culture of concern which is divided along cultural and geographical lines.
That is why we need to ensure that we also have compassion for our Muslim and Arab partners when they are hit by catastrophes of this kind, so that terrorists cannot - and after all this was the aim of 11 September - play off one civilisation against another and actually orchestrate the 'clash of civilisations'.
The dead in Algeria are also our dead.
The homeless in Algeria are also our homeless.
If we speak of a global village in economic terms then we must also speak of a global village of compassion and solidarity.
That is why, where our partners in the Mediterranean, in the Arab world, are concerned, who are on our doorstep and with whom we need to work more closely than ever, it is the European Union's duty to provide substantial humanitarian aid, and also to ensure that Algeria is put in a position where it is more capable than it has been in the past of helping itself.
Helping people to help themselves must be our overriding aim, but of course our aim now must also be to provide the victims of this disaster with direct practical help, not only by giving them money, not only by writing them a big cheque, but also by making it clear to them that what happens to them is something which we Europeans are deeply concerned about, something which matters to us as much as what happens to ourselves.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Members of Parliament for their kind remarks concerning ECHO and I shall convey these congratulations to Mr Nielson, the Commissioner responsible.
Firstly, as far as Hurricane Michelle is concerned, the Commission has been closely monitoring its effects in Central America in the Caribbean area since the beginning of the crisis, in cooperation with our experts and partners in this field.
Michelle started on 29 October as a tropical storm off the northern coast of Nicaragua and Honduras, where it caused severe floods.
The communication systems proved their efficiency as they were the only working systems that allowed for a quick evaluation in areas of difficult access such as Moskita.
On 1 November, ECHO started discussions with the NGOs present in the field to establish emergency systems, particularly in the Moskita region in Honduras and Nicaragua - the areas worst hit.
On 4 November, Michelle became a hurricane that crossed Cuba and touched Jamaica.
Fortunately, the local authorities had undertaken timely evacuation measures.
ECHO services decided on funding once an initial evaluation of the hurricane damage had been carried out in Cuba.
This decision to allocate EUR 1 050 000, should be approved by the end of this week and will cover the Moskita region in Honduras and Nicaragua, Cuba and Jamaica.
The decision will mainly involve the evacuation of people in danger, food aid for Honduras, the provision of temporary shelter in Jamaica and the distribution of water, sanitation and health packages in all countries.
Members of this House have raised two main issues.
One concerns Nicaragua.
I should like to assure you that all the distributed funds are regularly monitored and no irregularities have been detected so far.
That was the assessment of the Parliament delegation that visited Nicaragua.
The second comment concerned Cuba.
Some people wanted a revision of the EU Common Position on Cuba, announced on 25 June 2001.
But it kept being said Cuba had not been given any humanitarian aid until now.
In fact Cuba has benefited from around EUR 125 million in aid since 1993, largely in the humanitarian field, as well as the food security programme and some budget line assistance.
But for the time being, the line followed by the Commission is as proposed in the latest European Union Common Position which I have already referred to.
As far as Algeria is concerned, the situation in the country is very complex.
There are many different kinds of problems, but I will only refer to the problem of the flooding last weekend.
The European Commission has followed the situation with great attention and concern.
President Prodi sent a message to President Bouteflika to express the solidarity of the European Union with the Algerian flood victims.
Therefore the Commission, through its humanitarian aid office, has moved quickly in response to the floods.
A decision to allocate EUR 758 800 of humanitarian aid has been taken under the primary emergency procedure to help meet the urgent needs of the victims.
The funds are already being used for a range of support measures including temporary shelter, beds, clothing and blankets, water, sanitation and medical assistance.
Humanitarian operations funded under this decision will be implemented by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and by two NGOs - Médicins du Monde and Médicins sans Frontières.
With those decisions on Hurricane Michelle and the Algerian floods, the Commission underlines its determination to address the needs of victims of humanitarian disasters whenever they occur.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Trade in small arms
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0723/2001, tabled by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group, on small arms;
B5-0729/2001, tabled by Mrs Morgantini and Mr Brie, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on controlling international arms transfers and arms brokering;
B5-0730/2001, tabled by Mrs Maes, Mrs McKenna and Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on controlling international arms transfers and arms brokering.
Commissioner, Mr President, just as certain small-scale conflicts receive poor media coverage, so certain categories of what are known as light weapons could be said to receive poor legislative and financial coverage.
I mean that the legislation regulating them is insufficient and that they are cheap to buy. Why are we surprised, then, when it is this type of arms which keep these forgotten conflicts alive?
Yet the number of victims alone should concern us, if it were not concealed by the effects of poverty.
However, evidence that the world does have a conscience has emerged in the shape of the United Nations Programme of Action aimed at containing and controlling the transfers, or rather the trafficking of these light weapons which are responsible for extensive loss of human life.
In the light of the current international situation, with the armed alliance in Afghanistan and the international fight against terrorism, there is even greater need for the Union to join and support this resolute, pioneering UN measure.
The European Union' s military policy must be more than just defence measures controlled by senior military staff.
It must, in essence, be based on the prevention and control of the arms trade by an arsenal of binding laws covering all areas of this industry.
Our legislation must target arms brokering and export and detention licences, as well as extradition and police cooperation procedures, and national legislation governing these issues must be harmonised.
Instead of attempting to intervene in blazing conflicts, would it not be better to defuse them before they ignite?
The Union' s legislative structure would allow us to do this at the stage when we are still preparing for military action.
Europe must seize the opportunity afforded here.
Mr President, we are quite properly concerned about the spread of small arms and light weapons, particularly the illegal traffick in, and uncontrolled circulation of, these weapons.
I am not sure why Parliament has decided to bring forward an urgent resolution at this time, unless it wants to contribute something useful in the context of the current international crisis, the continuing threat posed by weapons held by terrorists or the consequences of the large accumulation of weapons in Taliban hands in Afghanistan.
There is some passing reference to these matters in the motion for a resolution which contains many useful elements.
For many years I have worked to overcome the problem of anti-personnel landmines but I have always sought to focus attention on the real culprits who use such weapons indiscriminately and irresponsibly.
Usually these were armed rebel groups in developing countries with no concern for human life and they had been supplied by non-western countries.
It is important, therefore, that when considering the matter of small arms we should take care not to become over-obsessed with our own authorities or industry: these are the easy targets.
Instead, we should focus on terrorist groups and other criminal elements that are sitting on stockpiles of weapons or continuing to obtain them from various sources.
It is scandalous, for example, that there has been toleration for so long of large stockpiles of weapons held by terrorist organisations such as the IRA in one EU Member State, in order that it may threaten or carry out attacks in another.
In relation to Afghanistan it is to be hoped that a legitimate government with democratic aspirations will be established there very soon, anxious to engage positively in the real world and begin the development of a sustainable economy and a better life for all its people.
There must also be efforts to remove weapons in Taliban hands and integrate ex-combatants back into some sort of mainstream society.
I am not referring to terrorists there.
Much has been achieved.
Our focus for the future in relation to small arms should be on identifying and destroying stocks of weapons held by insurgents, terrorists and criminals and cutting off their sources of supply.
This is the area on which we should be concentrating our efforts over the coming months and years.
Mr President, nearly ten years ago, in the early 1990s, I travelled through the Khyber Pass, a trip I can strongly recommend to all colleagues - though perhaps not at this moment.
At the top there is a small village where you can buy food, water and "souvenirs".
The "souvenirs" are drugs, home-made Kalashnikovs and home-made surface-to-air rocket launchers.
With the money I had on me I calculated that I could buy ten Kalashnikovs or three rocket launchers.
The only problem was how to get them home through customs, so I did not buy them!
Coming forward to 10 October this year, at the United Nations in New York there was a speech by the American Assistant Secretary for Arms Control.
He used wonderful sounding sentences, such as "we must redouble our non-proliferation and arms control efforts", "the entire globe faces a security challenge!"
But he had no proposals at all for controlling small arms.
Why?
Because the extremely powerful and wealthy organisation called The National Rifle Association - the NRA - helped to elect the present administration, which will therefore not stand up to the Association.
With the events of 11 September and the high murder rate inside the United States of America, I wonder just what it will take for America to cooperate with the rest of the world on this problem.
My Group supports the motion because it is a small step in the right direction.
- (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this problem - the trade and trafficking in small arms - is one of the most serious problems facing the world today.
The first observation I wish to make is that this expression 'small arms' is misleading, because small arms include heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, grenade throwers and mortars of less than 100 millimetres.
We are talking about devastating weaponry.
To quote the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, speaking at the Conference held in July, we must be fully aware of the terrible effects of the current trade in these arms.
It is estimated that there are some 500 million arms in circulation in the world today and that, every day, these arms kill on average more than one thousand people.
This is, therefore, an issue to which States must pay serious attention.
It is an area in which the fine line between seriousness and hypocrisy can be most clearly traced.
For many years I have called for the issues of the arms industry and trade to be the business of States alone.
Applying the market economy to this area can only have disastrous consequences, and instead of complaining about the trafficking and dealing in arms, we should be adopting stricter measures on the state control of the production and trade in these arms.
Unfortunately, however, governments themselves are not always entirely blameless.
Currently, in Portugal, a campaign is running, launched by Catholic missionary organisations and supported by the Portuguese section of Amnesty International, to draw attention to this scourge.
And why missionaries, you might ask?
Because missionaries are, particularly in Africa, those who have most frequent contact with the appalling consequences of this situation.
Unfortunately, my country - it is not only France, the United Kingdom and other often-mentioned European Union countries - is not entirely free of blame in this matter.
According to figures that have been released, in 1998, the year in which the European Union code of conduct was signed, Portugal sold around EUR 9 million' s worth of arms to countries that it should feel unable to do so, such as Angola, Algeria, Colombia, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Sri Lanka and Turkey.
Portugal also sold around EUR 5 million' s worth of arms to a further eleven countries that should, at the very least, be under strict observation.
We support the resolution that has been tabled.
This is a matter on which some progress has been made, but more energetic steps must be taken.
Above all, the European Union must set an example in this area.
We cannot shed crocodile tears on Thursdays over conflicts that are continually supplied by the legal or illegal trade in these arms.
Mr President, the accumulations of small arms dotted all over the planet are a cause of destabilisation and crisis and the European Union has promised to do what it can to combat this phenomenon.
The European Union has proposed, as part of its joint action on small arms and light weapons, to introduce a series of confidence-building measures, including measures to improve transparency.
The Union has promised funding and technical assistance to countries, international organisations and non-governmental organisations asking for support for this purpose.
The European Union welcomes the results of the United Nations conference on the illegal trade in small arms although, as the members have said, it does of course recognise that the results might have been clearer and more concrete.
However, we believe that the very fact that this first conference was held at all is an important step.
We particularly welcome the decision to organise another conference before 2006 so that the progress made can be examined and evaluated by then.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
As indicated on the display board, the next item is Mrs Lynne' s report.
The debate is scheduled for 5.30 p.m.
I am therefore going to suspend the sitting for a short while.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.20 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)
Announcement by the President
I wish to speak about a very special matter: today, for the first time, If am not mistaken and if I am not misleading the House, we will have the opportunity to have twelve booths, because out of respect for this report and as a result of the rapporteur' s invitation, we will today have sign language interpretation to my right, as you can see, which is a tribute to the communication between this Parliament and all of Europe' s citizens, whoever they may be.
2003, European Year of People with Disabilities
The next item is the report (A5-0377/2001) by Mrs Lynne, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the European Year of People with disabilities 2003 [COM(2001) 271 - C5-0306/2001 - 2001/0116(CNS)].

Mr President, I welcome the sign language interpreter. I only wish that we could have sign language interpretation for all our debates to make sure that all people could access all the reports.
The timing of this debate is very sad, when so few Members are present in the Chamber and, even more importantly, to vote later.
It is very important to demonstrate our commitment to disabled people.
Putting the report right at the end of a Strasbourg agenda does not demonstrate any commitment.
Having said that, I thank the Commission for their cooperation on my report and all the other Members of the European Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
I have managed to incorporate a number of their amendments.
I believe that is one of the main reasons why we do not have any new amendments today.
The European Year of Disabled People, 2003 must not just pay lip service to the problems that disabled people face.
We need to have concrete outcomes.
For a start, we must truly move away from the medical model of disability to the social and rights-based model of disability.
We must make sure that we mainstream disabled people; that all legislation takes account of the specific needs of disabled people, whether they are wheelchair users, someone with a visual impairment, someone with a hearing impairment, someone with a learning difficulty, or someone with a mental health problem.
All EU citizens should have equal rights.
I hope that in 2003 - if not before - we make sure that all of Parliament's buildings are accessible to disabled people - they are not at the moment - and that all EU Member States are aware of the problems that disabled people face.
I shall tell you a story about what happened to Jenny, one of my constituents, the coordinator of Access Charter.
I invited her over to the Article 13 Anti-Discrimination hearings.
She uses a wheelchair.
For a start, she could not get into the Parliament's buildings in Brussels without going through revolving doors because they refused to open the double doors.
I remonstrated with them.
They unlocked them, took off the rope that was binding them and then 20 minutes later they were locked and bound again.
We booked her a hotel room with disabled people's access.
Somebody had put a bed across the bathroom door and so she could not get in.
She had to change hotels.
She then went out to try to get something to eat at night, with her colleagues - remember she was using a wheelchair.
No taxi in Brussels would stop for her.
She managed to get to a restaurant.
The manager then came out and said "You can't come in here.
Your appearance will put off other diners."
When she got to the airport she was subjected to a full body search.
She remonstrated with the security people.
One of them said: "Have a nice trip.
I hope your plane crashes."!
That demonstrates the problems that disabled people face and the real need for a disability directive.
I hope we will hear the announcement of that in 2003.
We have to have funding for major research into the status of disabled people.
We have to have a study into the situation disabled people face in institutions in particular.
It is essential that regional and local government are involved in this year but, more importantly, that organisations of disabled people and representing disabled people are involved in this year.
I have called specifically for a funding increase from EUR 12 million to EUR 15 million over the two years.
Particularly for sign language interpretation, for personal assistance, for accessible meeting rooms, for hotels etc., there are added costs; in addition, funding for impairment-specific NGOs is only for 2002, not for the year itself.
Furthermore, in line with the Article 13 Action Programme on Anti-Discrimination, I have called for subsidies for the expenses for special events at European level to go up from "not exceeding 80%" to "not exceeding 90%".
We must also have a proper evaluation of the year in clear and simple language, and in accessible formats.
I made my report available in all accessible formats at my own expense.
But I would like the Commission, in future, to make available on request any report at whatever stage in accessible format.
Finally, the year must be the step in the right direction to combat discrimination.
But more importantly, it has to be a celebration of disabled people's contribution to society.
Mr President, I would just like to say that I am standing in for my colleague, Mr Andrews, and I am very honoured to do so because of the important issues in this excellent report by Mrs Lynne.
The purpose of the year is to provide for a coordinated effort to change attitudes and to promote the removal of social and environmental barriers to equality and to assist in legal and policy developments.
This means putting a value on diversity and celebrating diversity.
It also includes making us aware of issues relating to multiple discrimination.
I want to stress our full support for the designation of 2003 as European Year of People with Disabilities.
I know that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs also supports the objectives of the year, as members unanimously backed my colleague's opinion.
There are approximately 38 million people in the European Union who have a disability.
They face a wide range of barriers, including different forms of discrimination.
People with physical and sensory disabilities are just as much a part of our society as able-bodied people.
Very often, however, they are hindered from taking part in our society.
What makes it worse, as Mr Andrews states in his opinion, is that they are not hindered by their disabilities, but by their environment and the attitudes towards them.
They suffer multi-discrimination.
This must change.
Some of the problems include public transport and access to buildings, stairways and doors which are not wide enough to allow wheelchair access.
Surveys show that the intellectual capacity of people with physical disabilities is very often under-estimated.
They can be discriminated against when applying for jobs.
The exclusion of people with disabilities from society not only denies their fundamental rights, but also deprives society of diversity and inclusivity.
People with disabilities can make a positive contribution to society.
Their experiences can encourage more tolerance, understanding and awareness of the needs of others besides their own capacities and abilities.
Our own goal must be to end discrimination and safeguard their rights.
It is important that discrimination against people with disabilities is tackled as a mainstream issue.
The four amendments presented by my colleague, Mr Andrews, were fully supported by the rapporteur, Mrs Lynne, and endorsed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
They are now Amendments Nos 20, 45, 47 and 48. I have nothing else to add, only to congratulate Mrs Lynne on her excellent report and on the very touching speech she gave to us in the presentation of the report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, sign language interpreter, I would like to express a few thoughts on the World Year of People with Disabilities.
I am also speaking on behalf of Mr Mantovani, who is particularly interested in this subject and cannot be here with us today.
This a truly vast subject, as can be seen from the statistics: today there are approximately 30 million people suffering from disabilities in the European Union.
This means that one European in ten encounters barriers not just in the field of work but also in access to public transport, buildings, private services, education and training - in other words, in all areas of daily life.
However, there are other barriers as well, maybe less obvious but just as insurmountable, which restrict the freedom of European citizens with disabilities, such as the barriers to movement within the Union and to going to live in another Member State.
All these barriers too often prevent people with disabilities from playing the active role they would like in society, work, school and daily activities.
We need a multifaceted strategy to ensure that these people are guaranteed equal opportunities in full respect for the European citizens' Charter of Fundamental Rights.
However, there is one right which stands out above the others: the right to full citizenship.
That is why our group, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote with conviction for the proposal for a Council decision on the Year of People with Disabilities - or, as we used to say in Italy in the olden days - people with different abilities - 2003.
I therefore thank the rapporteur, Mrs Lynne, for her good work and for accepting the 17 amendments tabled in committee.
Three of those were tabled by us, and we feel they are particularly important because they uphold three concepts: firstly, recognition of the importance of the role played by the family at all stages in the lives of people with disabilities; secondly, promotion of a culture of solidarity within society, meaning an understanding that a person' s value is not expressed solely in terms of what he does or is able to do, but primarily in what he represents, namely a human being in all respects; thirdly and lastly, reflection on the concept of the quality of life of a person with disabilities, understood not just to be access to employment or training but also all the other aspects of daily life, in the family and in and as part of society, a quality of life which is genuinely high and equal for people with disabilities too.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Lynne, ladies and gentlemen, it is a happy coincidence that this week, just a few metres away from the Chamber, we can see an exhibition organised by Bernd Posselt entitled, 'chain of understanding'.
It shows hands, helping hands, joining hands, hands expending energy, and this exhibition is devoted to disabled people and includes work done by disabled people.
At this point I should therefore like to thank all of those who give time, patience, energy and love and make sacrifices for those who need their help.
This includes the families of disabled people, but many more besides.
We should not leave them out in the Year of Disabled People.
My second point is that I am glad that 2003 is to be the Year of Disabled People, particularly now, because for me it also shows that the Stability and Growth Pact and an aggressive disability policy are not only not contradictory, but also not mutually exclusive, if we are serious about the European social model, defending the dignity of all human beings and ensuring respect for human rights, which are principles to which we feel committed.
We still have much to do, however.
We need more equality in everyday life.
This involves firstly actually implementing all of the constitutional provisions.
We need to move from principle to practice.
Secondly, we need more comprehensive integration.
Integration must not end at the school gates, but must also encompass working life and social life.
Thirdly, we need disabled people to have the right to receive support to live the life of their own choosing.
Disabled people must be able to decide for themselves how they wish to live their lives.
Fourthly, we have to change the images we have, such as the image of a disabled person doing handicrafts.
Here, PCs, the Internet and integration using the new media could be very helpful.
With this in mind, we are looking forward to the Year of Disabled People, because we hope that it will sharpen the focus of our work and that we will be able to take further initiatives to eliminate the injustices and barriers which exist in our society.
Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Lynne not just on this particular report, but for her constant faith in and fight for policies for the disabled.
I should also like to make a point of thanking Parliament for the support and enthusiasm with which it accepted the proposal for 2003.
We need to make 2003 the year in which we send out a clear message that policies for the disabled are not just solidarity policies.
They are not just humane or charitable policies. They are policies based on fundamental human and civil rights.
The second important point is that 2003 should not just galvanise governments into action.
It should also galvanise social and business circles and the scientific community into action.
Governments themselves should start up action plans for a package of policies. Transport, urban planning, special policies for the job market, education.
Society should do everything it can, especially through the civil society and non-governmental organisations, to foster collaboration and take innovative initiatives which can be used as a basis for new proposals for the European Union.
Business circles can also play an important part.
Support for research and new product technology can bring about exceptional new products for people with disabilities and new technological products can be adapted to the specific requirements of different types of disability.
As Mrs Lynne referred to the Commission reports, may I inform you that only yesterday I started up my new web page, which can be read by Braille.
2003 should be seen as a year in which we push ahead with European priorities, such as those set out in the Commission communication on a "Europe without frontiers", while the individual Member States promote their national objectives, which differ from one country to another, given that policies for people with disabilities are at various stages of development.
I must say that I accept most of your amendments, in both spirit and letter.
I should like to highlight the following points: first, I totally agree that we need to concentrate more on awareness-raising about various types of disabilities and the fact that some people with very serious disabilities are victims of multiple discrimination and, of course, the plight of those kept in institutions.
The second important factor are the special policies on education and employment.
Access to the job market depends on education and we need to focus on this.
The third important point is the need for all the agencies involved to work together.
We cannot propose and implement policies for the disabled.
We need to work with their organisations so that we can present policies in which they themselves are involved.
We believe that 2003 will be the start of a new form of collaboration, a new type of innovative policy at European level for people with disabilities.
The budget, which is EUR 12 million, is small but we should point out that it is not for implementing policies but to back specific events of local or national importance, the main function of which will be to kick start societies and organisations.
I should also say that we believe that it makes sense to leave the funding ratio at 50% of activities at national level because this will allow for more events while, at the same time, allowing governments to take additional action in a range of policies.
May I again congratulate Mrs Lynne on her personal stand.
I should also like to inform you that the Council will take its final decision on 3 December 2001, the same date as the European Day of Disabled People.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, at 6.30 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.55 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m.)
Mr President, I have just one question: on Tuesday morning we approved requests for urgent procedure for the items on financial aid for a series of Balkan countries, and I regret that these are obviously not going to be taken until the mini-session, because we would have had sufficient time to deal with this issue in this afternoon's sitting, which has been suspended twice.
In the past, of course, anything which we added to the agenda on Tuesday morning was always taken on the Friday.
I hope that it will soon be possible to revert to this practice when Friday sittings are reinstated, but I wanted to take this opportunity to ask when these items will be taken in the Brussels sitting because you did not announce this just now.
Mr Posselt, according to my information, these will be adopted on Thursday 28; in other words, they will appear on the agenda for Thursday 28.
As for the rest of your comments, Mr Posselt, you are entirely within your rights to make them, but I hope that the Conference of Presidents considers the basis of your comments, for which there is some justification, I must admit.
Vote
Mr President, I voted for the report on the European Year of People with Disabilities, but Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are also some States whose laws include rules which discriminate against people with disabilities.
I am sad to say that there is even an Italian law which discriminates against them on age grounds, thus violating Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Indeed, it stipulates that people with disabilities who are over 65 years old are not entitled to the EUR 350 allowance granted to people with disabilities who fall ill before they reach the age of 65.
I therefore call upon the Commission to present a proposal implementing Article 13 outside the workplace as well, and, at last, to force the States which are not yet applying it to do so. I refer, in particular, to Italy, and I hope that the Berlusconi government will listen to what I am saying and abolish the laws currently in place in Italy - as in other parts of Europe - which discriminate against people with disabilities.
Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity of an explanation of vote to thank Mrs Lynne for her outstanding report, but also to thank Mr Karas for mentioning my exhibition and Mrs Petter who was responsible for putting it together.
This is a splendid initiative for disabled and traumatised children who are cared for by a children's centre in Munich.
This initiative will now be continued in Italy and France by a series of colleagues.
Mrs Lynne has spontaneously offered to take it to England too.
I am very grateful.
This is a good start to our preparatory work for the Year of Disabled People.
That is why I should like to thank all of those colleagues who are supporting this magnificent initiative from Bavaria.
The good intentions of our rapporteur notwithstanding, we are worried that the European Year of People with Disabilities (2003) will be a year in which a great deal of money is spent and numerous events are staged, but which does nothing to change the situation of disabled people, especially those from the poor sections of society.
We are worried by the hypocrisy of all this interest being expressed in people with disabilities by the various institutions of the European Union because it is the very policy of the European Union, with its capitalist restructuring, privatisation of health, welfare and education and undermining of workers' rights and social insurance, which is to blame.
The first dramatic victims of this policy are the handicapped and people with disabilities.
They hypocritically maintain that their aim is to "promote equal opportunities" and "combat discrimination".
But does a young person or a child from a poor, working class family living at risk of disease and accident have the same opportunities, first and foremost in preventing disability, as a young person or child of the bourgeoisie?
Does a child whose father is an executive of a multinational company have the same opportunities in finding work as a child whose father is unemployed?
It is impossible to combat the various types of discrimination which arise in a capitalist society as long as the main type of discrimination between the exploiters and the exploited continues to reign supreme.
What sort of a fight against discrimination is their policy, which spreads poverty, unemployment and illiteracy?
Of the 38 million disabled in the ÅU, 7.5 million are of school age.
How many of these children have special schools or special classes and the special equipment needed for them to acquire an education?
In Greece, only 7% of disabled children attend special schools, while 185 000 disabled children are not even in the education system.
And yet not one ÅU text, including the one under debate, so much as mentions free national health, welfare and special education, even for these people.
Nowhere does it suggest that the technical assistance needed for education, vocational rehabilitation or daily life should be provided free of charge.
This situation will change when the people, the workers and the disabled fight to obstruct the policy of "free competition and market laws" until it has been overturned.
This fight has the vote of the Communist Party of Greece.
Although, as we know, the main purpose of this kind of venture, modelled on International Women' s Day or World Aids Day, is to assuage the consciences of the most sincere of those who support the initiative and to conceal the desire not to do anything of the more cynical among them, we voted for the report on the proposal for a Council Decision on the European Year of People with Disabilities, for that was what the organisations of people with disabilities wanted us to do.
They hope that the action taken as part of this initiative will help them to attract public attention and, at the same time, to make their just demands known.
That said, we condemn the hypocrisy of decision-makers within the European Parliament, other European Union institutions and national bodies who broadcast their concern for human rights, non-discrimination and equality loud and clear, but who ultimately refuse to take action or adopt binding measures forcing companies to employ people with disabilities, for example, or to adapt modes of transport for access by people with disabilities simply because they see profit-making as more important than meeting basic human needs, even though society does have the necessary resources to address these needs.
That is the end of voting time.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The session was adjourned at 6.50 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 15 November 2001.
Announcement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, Spain has once again been cruelly struck by terrorism.
On 23 November, Ana Isabel Arostegui and Javier Mijangos, both officers of the Ertzaintza, the Basque regional police, were killed in a cowardly attack whilst carrying out their duties in Beasaín, in the Basque region of Spain.
Two days prior to that incident, terrorists set off a bomb in Bilbao, injuring two other officers of the same police force.
On my own behalf and on behalf of the European Parliament as a whole, I immediately sent a message expressing my most sincere condolences to the families of the victims of these despicable attacks, as well as our wishes for a speedy recovery to those injured.
Once again, terrorist groups in Spain have acted with fatal disregard, showing that they deny the right to life and totally reject the concept of democracy.
Having made an assault on justice, by killing Judge José María Lidon Corbi, they have, this time, attacked the Basque regional police force.
In doing so, they are showing their determination to attack the main pillars of democracy.
With our heartfelt thoughts for the victims, their families and all those who fight for democracy, I would like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to observe a minute' s silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Ladies and gentlemen, since our last session, five journalists have unfortunately been killed in Afghanistan.
Maria Grazia Cutulli, Julio Fuentes, Harry Burton and Azizullah Haidari were killed in an ambush between Jalalabad and Kabul.
Ulf Stroemberg was found dead following a burglary in Taloqan.
As you know, we are also extremely concerned about Ken Hechtman, who is missing.
The eight journalists who have died in Afghanistan since the beginning of the conflict were carrying out their duties in a courageous, passionate and tenacious manner.
They believed that it was their overriding duty to inform others.
I would like to pay a warm and sincere tribute to them for the work they did, because they enabled us to keep constantly abreast of developments in Afghanistan.
Freedom of information is one of the most fragile freedoms.
The death of these journalists illustrates this. I admire the way in which they fulfilled their duties.
At this time, our thoughts go out to their families and their colleagues, who are devastated by their loss.
I would like to ask you to observe a minute' s silence in order to display our deepest sympathy.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Order of business
With regard to the agenda, I have two changes to propose.
First of all, the Committee on Budgets adopted Mr Ferber' s report on the supplementary estimates of revenue and expenditure of the European Parliament, and has asked for this report to be put on Thursday' s agenda, pursuant to Rule 114 of the Rules of Procedure.
(Parliament gave its assent)
The second proposal is from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, regarding the vote on Mr Bouwman' s report on the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer, requesting that the vote be brought forward to tomorrow' s voting time.
This is because the Council intends to take its decision on this on 3 December.
(Parliament gave its assent)
The order of business is thus established.
Speeches on points of order
Madam President, I would just like to draw the attention of the House to what happened yesterday in Rome. A disaster occurred in which many firemen died and others were wounded; some of them are in an extremely serious condition.
They rushed to save human lives with the same courage displayed by the firemen in New York.
I feel that it is right for us, as European citizens and the European Parliament, to pay tribute to these brave men who have laid down their lives in an attempt to save the lives of others.
A block of flats collapsed, and if these men had not sacrificed themselves, others might have died.
I feel that Parliament should also pay tribute to these brave, remarkable firemen.
Mr Tajani, I have already sent a message of condolences to the Italian government.
Madam President, I, too, would like to express my grief at the deaths which occurred in the incident in Rome yesterday, and to express my heartfelt thanks and full support for the work of the police force and the municipal police, in particular, who are always ready and willing to act in the front line, not just to combat crime but also to come to the aid of European citizens at difficult times such as these, and who are always prepared to lose their lives doing deeds of great bravery, as, sadly, happened in Rome as well as New York.

Madam President, in this week dedicated to employment, I wish to draw your attention to the several thousand Portuguese workers who live in the worrying situation of great instability, with companies going bankrupt with impunity and no one being held responsible, even when it is known that they were viable and had healthy order books, which is what has happened at Molin, Confelis and Norporte.
Despite Portuguese workers having the lowest wages in the European Union, there have recently been countless cases of companies not paying salaries on time, already involving more than PTE 20 billion and many thousands of workers.
I would, in particular, highlight the situation at the Mandata e Mortensen glassworks in Marinha Grande, at the Sotima timber plant in Proença-a-Nova, at Cuftexteis, in Ansião, and the threats being levelled at hundreds of workers at the Eres textiles company in Fundão, because of their local and regional importance and because of the consequences for the development of the areas that are affected.
Apart from showing some solidarity with these workers, Madam President, I should like you to inform the Commission and the Council of this serious situation that is affecting thousands of Portuguese workers.
Madam President, speaking as a Basque and, therefore, as a Spaniard, I would like to thank you for the sensitivity you always show with regard to the problem of terrorism in the Basque country.
On the other hand, and I am sorry to have to say this, I must point out that from time to time on these occasions when, in theory, we are supposed to be observing a minutes silence, there are people in this House who continue to talk, even on the telephone, which seems to me to show, amongst other things, a total lack of consideration.
Under Rule 19(4), may I ask you to personally intervene with the Greek authorities on behalf of my constituents Paul and Lesley Coppin of Mildenhall, and Anna Skinner of Epping, in relation to her brother Anthony Adamiak, and on behalf of the other Europeans who are currently in jail in Greece for plane spotting.
We respect the independence of the judiciary in Greece and the cooperation we have thus far been given from the Greek authorities, but when these people have already been in prison for three weeks without charge and now have a further two weeks before charges are brought, I hope you will agree that there is an urgent humanitarian need for an appeal on their behalf and also a need to remind the Greek authorities of their absolute duty under the Convention on Human Rights to bring charges before defendants.
Twelve people went on holiday and have ended up in jail.
I ask for your intervention on behalf of the European Parliament.
Mr Howitt, you are aware that Mr Van Orden already brought up this issue at our previous part-session in Strasbourg.
Of course, I acted upon Mr Van Orden' s comments and my Cabinet contacted the Greek permanent representation.
We were given some further details.
There was, in fact, due to be a court hearing this Monday.
We are unable to confirm whether or not this hearing took place.
I am perfectly willing to intervene myself, depending, of course, on how events unfold, and on the situation, which, I can assure you, we are monitoring extremely closely.
Madam President, I should like to thank the honourable Members, whose acute interest in human rights and compliance with the rule of law in the Member States of the European Union is most gratifying.
At the same time, I am glad for this opportunity to point out that all substantive and adjectival rules, human rights and the rule of law are complied with to the highest degree in Greece, as I believe they are in the United Kingdom.
Having said which, I believe that the judiciary in my country will be scrupulous in complying with the requirements of both Greek domestic legislation and international conventions.
However, I should like to take this opportunity, merely for information purposes, to apprise the House of certain facts, so that we know where we stand.
We live in an age in which terrorism operates on an international scale.
The people arrested in Greece had been arrested on a previous day at another airport and cautioned against taking photographs of military installations, especially during operations or exercises and, according to the newspapers, transcripts of communications between air force aeroplanes and between aeroplanes and the base were found among their effects.
They were then found at another airport and it was at this other airport that they were arrested, having been warned what would happen beforehand.
So, as you can see, in these times of heightened awareness of the threat of terrorism, in these times when everyone knows that this sort of ban applies to every military base in Europe, and given that they had been warned, there was no more room for flexibility or turning a blind eye.
Nonetheless, I am sure that the proper procedure will be followed to the letter because Greece is at the vanguard of the 15 in providing the necessary guarantees for all citizens brought before its courts, irrespective of where they are from.
I trust that these few words have given the House the information it needed.
Thank you, Mr Souladakis.
Ladies and gentlemen, given that I have a further ten or so points of order, most of which relate to this issue, and that this matter is almost turning into a debate in itself, I propose that we leave the points of order and proceed to the debate on the preparation for the Laeken European Council, as these comments could be made after the debate.
Future of the European Union
The next item is the joint debate on:
the Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the Laeken European Council on 14 and 15 December 2001;
the report (A5-0368/2001) by Mr Leinen and Mr Méndez de Vigo, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Laeken European Council and the future of the Union (2001/2180(INI));
the report (A5-0399/2001) by Mrs Kaufmann, on the Commission White Paper on European Governance (COM(2001) 428 - C5-0454/2001 - 2001/2181(COS));
the oral questions (B5-0529/2001) to the Council and (B5-0530/2001) to the Commission, by Mr Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the European strategy to promote quality in employment and in social policy.
At the end of the joint debate, I have six motions for resolution concerning the European Council, tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
I would like to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Louis Michel.
We are pleased to have you here and I shall now give you the floor.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the areas to be discussed at the European Council in Brussels-Laeken on 14 and 15 December will include the future of the European Union, European security and defence policy, enlargement, the fight against terrorism, the area of freedom, security and justice, the general situation of the EU and its prospects, employment and social cohesion, headquarters and various bodies and agencies, and lastly, external relations.
With regard to the future of the European Union, the European Council will adopt the text of a declaration that will launch the debate on the future of Europe.
The first chapter of the text will analyse the strengths and weaknesses of European integration, the second will bring together the issues that the Convention might tackle, and the third will set out how the debate will be organised.
The General Affairs Council of 19 November has already confirmed that the Member States agree on the procedures.
The principle of calling a preparatory Convention is an important step towards building a Union that is stronger, more readily understood by the people, and more focused on meeting its essential objectives.
Representatives from governments, the Commission, the national parliaments and the European Parliament will take part in the Convention.
With regard to the candidate countries, the Presidency' s proposal is based on the following principles: they will be fully involved in the work of the Convention with the right to express their views; they will be represented in the same way as Member States, in other words, by one representative for each government and two parliamentary representatives. The representatives from candidate countries who have not yet signed their accession treaty will not take part in the consensus when the Convention draws up its final report.
The Chair of the Convention will be appointed by the Laeken European Council.
The Chair will be assisted by a Presidium made up of representatives of the various component groups of the Convention.
The Presidency-in-Office of the Council will take part, but the precise involvement of representatives of the following two presidencies is yet to be decided upon.
Lastly, the Secretariat of the Convention will be fulfilled by the Council' s General Secretariat, which will be able to enlist the help of the Commission, as well as the secretariats of the European Parliament and the national parliaments.
We have reached unanimous agreement on consulting civil society through representative organisations at European and national level.
We dispensed with the idea of a Forum made up of a separate assembly.
These organisations could be interviewed or consulted in line with methods that are yet to be defined.
The contributions from these organisations will be included in the official documentation sent to members of the Convention.
The Convention will begin its work as soon as possible under the Spanish Presidency and will complete its proceedings by the European Council in June 2003.
We are still considering the length of time that will pass between the end of the Convention' s work and the beginning of the Intergovernmental Conference.
With regard to the themes, the Presidency' s approach was to work on the basis of the content of the Declaration of Nice to draw up a sufficiently broad and coherent mandate, which the Presidency could use for its work.
The Presidency supports the recommendations made by the rapporteurs, Mr Leinen and Mr Méndez De Vigo, on this point.
These themes are placed in five groups of open and impartial questions: the goals and the content of the Union' s policies, the division of competences between the Union and its Member States, the democratic legitimacy of the system, the ability of the Union to decide on and to pursue policies.
When the Prime Minister visits each capital city, he will present an outline of the Laeken Declaration.
The subjects that the Convention may tackle will be presented in this outline in the form of questions and choices, so as to enable the delegations to issue an opinion with full background knowledge.
To sum up what I have said on this important matter, I would like to make the following comments. Whatever the content of the Laeken Declaration, the Convention will remain in charge of its own agenda.
I think that there would be no point into trying to shackle it with a predefined mandate.
The Presidency has attempted to set out and clarify the themes dealt with at Nice, where the declaration was willingly drafted in a relatively open manner.
Nothing that the Presidency proposes should be interpreted as a mandate for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.
The mandate of this conference will be decided in accordance with the procedures laid down under the Treaties.
Lastly, the goal of the Laeken Declaration is to ensure that the Convention method is fruitful and that its results are taken up by the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference.
The debate on the future of Europe must also aim to make the European Union more transparent, more effective, and bring it closer to its citizens.
In this regard, the Council took great interest in Mrs Kaufmann' s report on the White Paper on European Governance.
The report contains some valuable guidance.
I particularly support the concern to ensure that the greater involvement of civil society in the way the Union works does not adversely affect the key role played by the representatives that have political responsibility.
I shall now turn to the European security and defence policy.
The Presidency will submit a report to the European Council that sets out the progress that has been made.
Work is well underway on improving military capabilities and strengthening civil capabilities, as shown at the capabilities conferences held on 19 and 20 November 2001.
With regard to declaring the European security and defence policy operational, the Union is faced with the following dilemma: either it cannot issue the declaration because of a veto imposed by one of the NATO members, who is not a member of the EU, or the Union declares it operational without the declaration having any real capabilities, as it is unable to use NATO assets.
In both cases, I want to draw your attention to the fact that it is, of course, the Union' s credibility that is at stake.
The third approach recommended by the Presidency is to declare that the Union will decide how to respond to each situation, depending on the military and civil resources and capabilities at its disposal.
These are my comments on the European security and defence policy.
(NL) I should now like to turn to another topic, namely enlargement.
The Commission' s report was debated extensively at the General Affairs Council of 19 November.
Remarkable progress was made in the accession negotiations.
Consequently, we should be able to finalise the accession negotiations involving the countries that are ready from 2002 onwards, thus enabling these countries to take part in the 2004 elections.
The Belgian Presidency is proceeding with the same robust and regular rhythm as its Swedish forerunner.
At the same time, attention was focused on the implementation of the acquis communautaire by the candidate countries.
At the European Council of Laeken, the Heads of State and Government will be given the opportunity of sending out a few messages to the candidate countries.
The timeframe that was established in Nice and clarified in Gothenburg will be fully complied with.
Enlargement is irreversible, and ten new Members could be included by 2004.
In 2002, the Commission will make proposals to the Council concerning agriculture, cohesion policy and the budget of the Union.
The Commission will sketch a roadmap for the countries that are not involved in the first enlargement round.
Additionally, it will carry out a plan to strengthen the institutions of the candidate countries and will set aside EUR 250 million for that purpose.
I should now like to say a few words about terrorism.
The Presidency will be presenting a summary report at the European Council of Laeken, outlining the Union' s measures to combat terrorism.
That report will also look to the future.
These days, in my view, it is safe to state that the Union has responded promptly and effectively to terrorism.
Its response was comprehensive, and that is the added value which European action brings: the Union has asserted itself as an effective and credible, in fact, vital partner, on which the United States and third countries can rely in the fight against terrorism.
The Union has established its diplomatic and humanitarian role.
The Union and the euro zone have contributed to the stabilisation of the economy in a turbulent period.
Finally, despite major efforts which the fight against terrorism has required, the Belgian Presidency has not lost sight of the EU' s other priorities, including enlargement, the follow-up of Tampere and Lisbon, etc.
(FR) I shall now turn to establishing the area of freedom, security and justice.
The Laeken European Council must reiterate the importance of establishing the common area of freedom, security and justice.
The Union' s response to the challenge posed by the tragic events of 11 September has shown the political will of Member States to make progress in this area.
The introduction of a common asylum and immigration policy was one of the priorities of the Belgian Presidency' s work programme.
The progress we expected has not been made.
The Laeken Summit should be the opportunity to reinvigorate the asylum and immigration policy by implementing Tampere, to supplement and strengthen the coordination of instruments for police and judicial cooperation, by finally establishing Eurojust, to reiterate the principle of mutual recognition, thus demonstrating the trust that each Member State places in its partners' legal system.
On a practical level, the Presidency hopes to reach an agreement in Laeken on the following issues: a framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States; a framework decision on the fight against terrorism; a framework decision on the execution of orders freezing assets or evidence in the European Union and an agreement on the common list of terrorist organisations.
To move on to the next point, which is the economic situation and prospects for the European Union.
This issue will be discussed on the first day of the European Council.
The Finance Ministers will present their 'eurokits' and will announce the outcome of their negotiations on cross-border payments.
The message from Laeken must be to increase the Union' s credibility by emphasising the progress we have made, particularly in the area of international trade after the Doha meeting, in stressing the benefits of the single market and in respecting the economic Stability Pact.
The summit will stress the need to reiterate our determination to pursue the process launched at Lisbon and at Gothenburg.
With regard to the preparation of the Barcelona European Council, specific action needs to be taken before the end of the year - we must establish the Food Safety Agency, make progress on Community patents, reach agreement on cross-border payments in euro and on public contracts, as well as implement the Galileo project.
As far as employment is concerned, the European Council will discuss the 'employment package' .
It will support the aspects of this package as well the guidelines for 2002.
In these guidelines, the European Council will include a new horizontal objective on the quality of employment and will also adopt a first list of agreed indicators for the quality of employment.
Regarding the headquarters and the various bodies and agencies, the Heads of State and Government will try to reach an agreement on where to locate the headquarters of various bodies and agencies of the EU and the European Community.
As for external relations, the European Council will examine international issues in the light of current events.
If necessary, it will issue an opinion on the situation in Afghanistan, the Balkans and the Middle East.
As you will have noted, the Belgian Presidency has worked hard to show that the European Union has an important role to play on the international stage.
To sum up, ladies and gentlemen, I have outlined for you the work programme of the Laeken European Council.
This Council will be where the European Union takes decisions on some fundamental issues that will map out its long term future, such as the physical introduction of the euro, the confirmation that enlargement is irreversible and the operational aspects of the European security and defence policy.
The Laeken Council will also be the starting point for considering the future of European integration.
The citizens of Europe will be broadly consulted on this issue.
This is the meaning of the so-called Laeken Declaration.
(Applause)
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the summit at Laeken can be an historic one.
Our group has every faith in the Belgian Presidency, because Belgium has always been faithful to the ideal of European unification and, above all, because Belgium has always stood for the European Community approach.
We, in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats do not want Europe to be governed by a few great nations, but, rather, we want Europeans to work together, we want the European Community approach, and so we wish you, Mr President-in-Office, great success.
Both you and the President of the Commission have spoken about the enlargement, and the memory is still fresh in my mind of a conference with the leaders of our related parties from the acceding countries, that is to say, from the countries desirous of joining the European Union.
Following on the French foreign minister's highly misleading statements, we declare loud and clear that we must not give the impression that those who will be ready to sign the Treaties in the coming year will have to wait for the stragglers also to comply with the criteria.
Each country must be judged on its own merits; it is on this basis that we must proceed with the enlargement of the European Union.
At Laeken, you will no doubt be considering Afghanistan, which is indeed necessary, and we repeat that it is necessary to destroy the al-Qaeda terrorist networks.
Now, though, we must also create the basis on which the international community, comprising the European Union, the USA, and the Arab and Muslim world, will now help Afghanistan to rebuild itself, making it possible for a humane society to come into being there, with a government in Kabul that respects human rights, including the rights of women.
It is that task that is before us in the days and weeks ahead.
I would like to comment on the Middle East.
We urge all the parties involved to return to the negotiating table.
I am being very restrained in my use of language when I say that we greatly regret the way that the Prime Minister of Israel behaved towards the visitors from the European Union.
These were Mr Verhofstadt, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, Mr Michel, the Foreign Minister and Council President and also Mr Solana, the High Representative.
We have no patience with the way that the Israeli Prime Minister treated our delegation to Israel - and I can remember some of Israel's great Prime Ministers, such as Ben Gurion, Golda Meir and Yitzhak Rabin.
(Applause)
We encourage the Commission and the Council to keep to the course they have set.
We will always defend Israel's security, as we have always done in the past, but the people in Palestine are as much entitled to human dignity and a life lived in security, as are the Israelis, who rightly lay claim to that for themselves.
(Applause)
Let me make another comment on the Convention.
We have high hopes for what you will be deciding at Laeken.
The composition of the Convention is, numerically at least, well-known.
I beg you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to use all your influence to ensure that the fifteen government representatives are the sort of people who will work together in the Convention and will feel themselves bound by whatever proposal for a decision results from it, so that the governments, too, will be made to discharge their duties with regard to what the Convention brings into existence.
For the Convention is not some kind of seminar, so - if, at the end of it, we are to be able to say more than just Yes or No, and I know perfectly well that the governments want that to be the case - the Convention must come up with something so convincing that it will be binding on the governments.
Our group will, in any case, be sending its best and most experienced people to the Convention, so that we can achieve a real result.
We also echo President Prodi's demand and beg you to make your influence felt in order to make it possible for the Convention to start as early as possible in 2002 - in February or early March under the Spanish Presidency - and then be concluded under the Italian Presidency at the end of 2003, giving us, by then, a new Treaty ready for signature, on which we can then have very comprehensive and repeated discussions here in Parliament.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what I am saying reflects my profound conviction that Laeken is such an important summit precisely because it will be about the future direction of our European Union, about whether we carry on the way we did at the mini-summit in London, with seven countries taking part, eight countries not taking part, and the European Commission not even present, that is not how we envisage Europe. On the contrary, Europe is for us the European Community.
It is our wish that you, the Council Presidency and the Commission make Laeken an expression of this Community, and if you do that, you will have our entire support.
(Applause)
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we are on the threshold of a summit, under the Belgian Presidency, that will be very important in the history of the European Community.
Geographically speaking, Belgium is at the centre of the European Union. I hope it can also manage to be at the Union' s political centre.
With regard to the agenda that Mr Michel has presented, Madam President, I would firstly like to state my group' s support for the Leinen, Méndez de Vigo and Kaufmann reports, that deal with the fundamental issue of the future of the European Union.
Firstly, we have always supported the idea that there should be a Convention, because this has proved to be the method that allows for public debate, and for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be drawn up democratically.
With this in mind, we think that this is the best method to implement: a Convention that is politically solid, that has democratic support and which is methodologically consistent with its objectives.
For this reason, I would like to make some practical suggestions to Mr Michel with regard to the statements he has made.
Mr Michel, in this instance, Parliament would be grateful if you could act in the same way you did with the Convention for the Charter of Fundamental Rights with regard to appointing a President.
Propose a President at Laeken and let the Convention elect the President.
I think that this is a question of good manners, which, in a democracy, are very important.
Secondly, I also think that it is significant that you speak about the dual democratic legitimacy of the Union, because it currently seems as if civil society has nothing to do with MEPs or with members of the Member State parliaments.
It is important that we should open up to and consult with the organisations that enrich civil society, however, we must not forget that democratic legitimacy is essentially achieved through elected representatives.
In this regard, Mr Michel stated that the membership of the Bureau or Presidium of the Convention remains open.
If the President and the troika have a presence in the Bureau, the European Parliament' s proposal will make sense - two MEPs and two representatives from Member States - for this will provide a balance between the two branches of democratic legitimacy.
We also insist that there should be a wide-ranging and coherent proposal; we do not want to have to choose between a selection of sample proposals.
And in relation to the potential time gap mentioned by Mr Michel, we would like to see a proposal, under the Greek Presidency, that brings the work to a conclusion; we do not want the outcome of the Convention to be postponed indefinitely.
It must have a follow-up and must lead to a decision from the European Council.
With regard to the Commission, Mr Prodi, I would urge you, with regard to the responsibility you have as guardian of the Treaties, one of the Commission' s functions, to make proposals as quickly as is possible.
There are two points in Declaration No 23, for which the Commission has full jurisdiction, the simplification of the Treaties and the division of competences.
Some time before, you should table a proposal that we can debate.
This is one of the Commission' s functions that cannot be taken away.
With regard to governance, a related issue, we would ask you not to damn us with faint praise, as the British say, and which we Spanish might express as 'killing us with affection' because there are some really interesting proposals, but now the Handelkern report is being published.
Why can we not sit down together and reach an interinstitutional agreement on governance?
We also have a democratic responsibility and we cannot consent to legislative power being taken away from us though the back door.
This is a serious warning.

(Applause from the Left) Lastly, Madam President, with regard to the CFSP and the fight against terrorism, you will all be aware that we are all working very hard, using the emergency procedure, on producing a European Search and Arrest Warrant, a framework decision on terrorism, a fight against money laundering, which is also important and related to terrorism, and we think that a joint effort by all should be made on this matter.
But our actions must also show that we have learned from our mistakes and shortcomings, and there is a very serious shortcoming for which the European Union should accept responsibility, and I think that at Laeken an important step could be taken by making defence one of the issues we should address in the Convention and which are to be incorporated into the Treaties.
Finally, Madam President, we have very important political responsibilities where Afghanistan is concerned.
The first hostages of terrorism have been the Afghans and above all the Afghan women.
And in the Middle East we have to continue in our attempt to find a solution that will ensure the security of the State of Israel' s borders, but which will also allow the Palestinian State to function and to be respected.
Our debate today is on the future of Europe and I might take that as a point of departure.
President Prodi has talked about the indispensable necessity of the institutional triangle: the Commission, Parliament and Council.
It is indispensable and each part of it has a core, indispensable role and responsibility and benefits by the very fact of the three parts working well together.
Personally, I am getting increasingly fed up with so-called analyses in newspapers and commentaries on issues of personality which miss the points of substance.
The point of substance about the role of the Commission is that it is at the heart and core of the European project - and it is indispensably so - and that is the structure of truth which we must promote, defend and constantly revisit.
With regard to a sense of Europe as Hans-Gert Poettering mentioned earlier, I believe it has been diminished at the highest level through Members of the European Council.
Every State has a right to bilaterals and multilaterals but there is a time and a place for every one of those initiatives.
It is not the time and place to conduct such an initiative immediately preceding and in the same place as a Council meeting that is meant to discuss the same issues, as at Ghent.
When we reduce the European Security and Defence Policy to the somewhat farcical theatre of presence or absence at the dining policy at Downing Street, we diminish the idea of Europe itself and we need, from the top down, at the level of the European Council, a commitment to an internally consistent and coherent sense of Europe.
The Commission President and Enrique Barón Crespo have both referred to this question of the interinstitutional dialogue and balance and President Prodi has talked about the very sensitive issue of call-back procedure.
The one plea I would make, and we have already asked Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee to deal with this question with some urgency, is that before us now is the responsibility, among other things, to begin to implement one major part of the structural economic reform programme of Lisbon, namely to create a single European market for financial services.
If we cannot work out the levels of commitment and lay down rules with proper conditions between Parliament, Commission and Council, we run the risk of failing to meet the target and the necessity for reform.
There is therefore a general urgency and, in some parts, even a specific one.
I hope all candidate countries will participate in the Convention, under the principles of Helsinki, namely equal treatment.
That is all and there are 13 candidate countries.
Secondly, I hope there will be a minimum period between the Convention and the IGC.
I agree with all those who said that this business of reform must be finished before the next European election because then there will be a new Parliament, a new Europe after enlargement and a new Commission.
Madam President, in the short time available to me, I do not wish to repeat what has been said by our excellent rapporteurs, nor do I wish to concern myself with the strategy of the Council and the Member States, who have, for months, been setting this Convention up to be as feeble and unsuccessful as possible.
In this historic context, with one of the most important summits, preparing for an historic Intergovernmental Conference, in the offing, I wish to address the Commission.
Mr President of the Commission, I would very much like to remind you that all the great projects of European integration began with the Commission's visions and outlines and that the Commission was the spiritus rector and visionary behind almost every great step forward.
Let me remind you of the Single European Act, of the first Delors package, of Maastricht with its second Delors package and the Report on Economic and Monetary Union, of the White Paper on the completion of the internal market, of the White Paper on growth, competition and employment with its visions of the social dialogue and of a social chapter in the Treaty, of the White Papers on environmental policy and on the role of Parliament and of all the great concepts produced by the Commission, which went ahead of the Intergovernmental Conferences to prepare their way.
You speak today of the institutional triangle, which will indeed become a struggle for power between Council and Parliament, but where the Commission should be, I see nothing but a black hole.
Mr President of the Commission, where is the Commission's White Paper on European democracy?
Where is your draft European constitution?
Where is your White Paper on a system of checks and balances in this supranational space, on the Convention's methodology and on fundamental citizens' and human rights in Europe?
None of these have you produced, and today's marginal comments by you are insufficient.
Just to single out one point: if you do not even give this Convention the right to elect its own president from among its own members, you are disowning it before the eyes of the European public as a whole.
That is only one of the many errors you have been propagating instead of a vision.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I would like to say something about the Laeken Declaration and, in particular, about the Convention.
Especially since the failure of the Nice Summit, this Parliament has agitated for a new method for Intergovernmental Conferences.
Across party boundaries, it has worked jointly with our colleagues in the national parliaments and together with various representatives of civic society, to consign to the past, once and for all, the politics of secret diplomacy behind closed doors, of opaque decision-making and of horse-trading in marathon sittings through the long nights.
I believe this new approach, with the calling of a Convention, to be crucial to the European Union's future viability, for the primary issue here is the reinforcement of democracy in Europe.
It is, above all, about our citizens, about a comprehensive and broad debate on what shape should be taken by our common European home, which we hope we will, from 2004, share with ten more European countries.
Mr President-in-Office, today you have put before us the salient points of the Laeken Declaration, which is to be ambitious in its scope.
Let me return to a number of issues.
My group sees the composition of the Convention as being of extraordinary importance, and we take the view that two things, in particular, need to be taken into consideration here.
One is the principle of political pluralism.
There is an absolute need to guarantee that the various political forces are represented in the Convention and that the delegations of this Parliament or of the national parliaments should include not only representatives of the major political parties but also, because we need them, representatives of smaller political parties in the various European Union Member States. Above all, we need a productive bilateral political debate, without which discussions will be lacking in interest.
Both sexes also need to be appropriately represented.
I see that amendments to the report by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Leinen have been tabled on this subject. I hope that many Members will support these amendments so that, above all, the national parliaments and the Council will also then consider how they may comply with this criterion.
I believe there is an urgent need for purposeful and structured dialogue with civic society, something which you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, have mentioned.
We could, I think, also consider whether the Economic and Social Affairs Committee, which is an important mouthpiece for civic society, might play an intermediary role in this area.
I am very pleased with the announcement that the Convention is to draw up its own agenda, as not only questions about the institutions will have to be dealt with, but also a broad spectrum of the most diverse political issues, as well as the issue of how a wide variety of European policies are to be formulated in the future.
A report by the Commission tells us that 60 million people in the European Union are affected by poverty, at present, and I find myself thinking that this appalling figure alone tells us what a great need there is for political action, and that this Convention must be about a change of direction and a new kind of politics in Europe.
Mr President, the scope of European Union foreign policy needs to be extended in the light of the recent international developments, but the Member States' governments have to realise that we cannot have a common foreign policy without joint intelligence.
The geopolitical situation, poverty - an increasingly serious problem - and the growth of terrorism - there are now cells in all the countries of the globe - must prompt us to start work at Laeken on a project to introduce genuine joint intelligence, new intelligence which is not created or developed along the same lines as Europol but which is capable of being used transparently with political, economic and cultural analysts who will be able to focus our foreign policy on that cooperation and timely intervention without which the European Union, with or without institutional reforms, will not be able to get off the ground.
With a view to achieving peace in Afghanistan and the subsequent reconstruction of the country, the Union' s role both as mediator and a proactive force must be defined now so that Afghanistan' s future is characterised not just by economic recovery and the establishment of a democratic political system, but also by the reestablishment of a role for women in politics and social life.
The Union cannot ignore the fact that, to bring about genuine peace in the Middle East, we must work actively to oppose those who encourage, or, at any rate, do not offer resistance to local terrorism which, it is now quite clear, is supported at international level, and the Union has the economic and political tools to intervene along these lines.
In conclusion, the success or failure of the Convention depends on the will, the genuine European convictions motivating us, our will as individual parties and governments not just to produce documents on reforms but to focus on practical action that, as well as improving the situation of our own countries, can improve the situations of countries that look to us for help too.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, the EU' s Heads of State and Government have decided to hold a Convention on 14 and 15 December with a view to designing a constitution for a federation of national states.
Now, let us clear up any confusion. A federation of national states is a federal state.
A federal state is a state and not a federation, in the same way as a fruit knife is a knife and not a fruit.
States have constitutions, while federations of states are based on agreements in international law between independent nations.
I call upon the Heads of State and Government to give the Convention a clear mandate.
Is a draft constitution for a federal state to be devised, yes or no?
Or is a draft agreement between independent nations, not designed to establish a state, to be devised?
Why not let the Convention devise two different, clear and unambiguous proposals, one for a federal state - model 1, as envisaged by the federalists - and the other for a federation of states - model 2, as envisaged by the Euro-realists and focusing upon the cross-border problems we cannot solve ourselves in our own parliaments?
Submit the proposals for public debate, followed by a referendum in which all EU citizens are asked if they want a constitution for an EU state or an agreement between nations acting together.
When we have their answer, an Intergovernmental Conference can be held with a view to proposing changes to the existing treaties.
The great majority of people in all EU countries want a referendum.
Why, then, not ask for their views before we do anything in their name?
Let us have a peaceful and competitive debate concerning Europe' s future, and let the people give their answer.
I believe that people will prefer our version of a Europe of democracies, as set out in the minority opinion of the members of SOS Democracy.
I would happily defer to the majority in a referendum, but never to officials and ministers operating behind closed doors.
Mr President, President Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, the report drafted by my colleague Mr Méndez de Vigo and myself enjoys the support of a very large majority in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, with only Mr Bonde, Mr Berthu and Mr Sacrédeus being opposed to it.
So a substantial majority shares the position we have taken and I am pleased to learn today that the Belgian Presidency agrees with many parts of it and that even the Commission can go along with many of the points Parliament has made.
A powerful current of opinion sees Laeken as an important opportunity that we must seize in order to make our European Union more democratic and more capable of taking action. If that is so, Laeken is perhaps the last chance to do this before enlargement, when the EU is enlarged from fifteen States to between twenty-five and thirty.
I am very grateful to all those who have helped to prepare the way for the new method.
I find myself thinking back to the beginning of the year, and back in January or February all this seemed a long way in the distance.
I thank all those who have contributed to a new method really becoming possible - a convention in which the representatives of the parliaments will enjoy equal rights with the representatives of the governments in giving shape to this project for the future of this European Union of ours.
The Convention, though, must not be a merely cosmetic exercise, and I believe it would be very unsatisfactory if we were to simply list the options that are already present in Europe.
That these options are there, we know from the speeches of our Heads of State.
They are well known, and they are nothing new.
This Convention must be a political forum for grappling with solutions, one in which real effort is made to reach a consensus as to how we, in Europe, are to go forward.
That is the real task.
That we are to produce various proposals, be they federalist or, on the other hand, intergovernmental in nature, sounds very appealing, but, President Prodi, if we produce a hotchpotch of proposals, can we then expect strong responses from the Intergovernmental Conference?
I very much doubt it.
The governments have the same problem. They can come up with whatever they will, but the Intergovernmental Conference's unanimity principle results in the same sort of blockade that we had in Amsterdam and Nice.
No, I believe that the Convention represents the great opportunity to use the consensus method to arrive at the overwhelming majority.
What emerges is not unanimity, but the overwhelming tendency, the overwhelming majority.
If we go to the IGC with such a coherent proposal, we maximise the likelihood of it being accepted, because governments naturally find it hard to deny themselves consensus.
Issues still remain to be negotiated, and all this will have to be put into the form of a legal text.
All this work will have to be done by the IGC, but I would warn against restricting the Convention's role to that of drawing up options using different terminology.
That is not the task for a political forum such as a Convention.
We note that, at Laeken, the Council proposed someone to preside over the Convention; that is all well and good, but I do think that the Convention should be able to confirm him in office, and should be able to elect him.
A Convention elects its own President, and that is the procedure that should take place.
President Prodi, you spoke in terms of a small Bureau.
Such a Bureau would have a great deal to do, being the organ that would have to direct this great Convention, and it would be advantageous if the opposition parties, both from the national parliaments and from the European Parliament, could have as much a sense of being represented in it as did the majority.
Turning to the timetable, I am glad that the governments themselves state that more or less one year is needed, which would mean that the Convention would complete its work in June 2003.
There would then be a break, but just for the summer recess.
I am in favour of us all resting from our labours in July and August, so that the IGC can begin in September under the Italian Presidency and we can complete the constitutional treaty by the end of 2003, in good time for the European elections and also for enlargement.
With such a document we could stand before the peoples of Europe; it is my belief that, if the Treaty is successful to the extent that children can read it at school and understand it, then we will also be reducing the citizens' alienation from Europe, which is the task before us.
Mr President, I think that the European Council that is about to take place, this time in Laeken, is of fundamental importance.
We are at one of those pivotal moments, as Karl Jaspers would say.
We will find that the introduction into circulation of euro notes and coins will increase the sense of belonging to Europe.
Negotiations on enlargement will mean that a longstanding dream of many Europeans becomes reality.
I think that the terrorist attacks against Washington and New York on 11 September have awoken the consciousness of European citizens, who are now asking for more Europe and better Europe.
Therefore, your responsibility, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is great indeed.
But let me tell you that I think you are doing a very good job, and I would like to say that this Belgian Presidency has maintained an excellent attitude towards the European Parliament, one that has been based upon collaboration, participation, listening and, in short, the desire to work together.
Support for the Convention is something that this Parliament chose to adopt a long time ago, even before Nice.
In the Resolution of 17 November 1997, which I had the honour to present together with Dimitri Tsatsos, with regard to the Treaty of Amsterdam, we were already saying that the intergovernmental method for the revision of the Treaties had run its course and that we would have to look for another method.
This method is the Convention.
Do not think that the European Parliament gave its support to the Convention because of some kind of obsession.
This is not true.
We did this because the Convention brings Europe closer to its citizens, because it is more open, more public, more transparent, more participatory; it allows, as the Convention that drafted the Charter proves, that our citizens want to be involved in the construction of Europe.
For this reason we have put our faith in the Convention, and I am happy to say that the Convention will be brought to life in the Laeken declaration.
Make no mistake about the Convention, however.
It is an instrument.
With regard to another famous Convention in history, the Philadelphia Convention, George Washington said that you could talk about everything, propose everything yet decide upon nothing.
This is also true.
What we want is to help the decision making process, bringing Europe closer to its citizens, its people and bringing together the various legitimacies of the European Union.
Therefore, Members of the Council, there is no need to be afraid of the Convention.
There is no need to take a successful instrument and empty it of content.
There is no need to constrict the Convention.
You must give the Convention all it needs to be a success.
The previous speakers - above all Mr Leinen, with whom I have had the great pleasure of collaborating in the drafting of this report - have spoken about many different subjects.
Let me highlight some of these.
Firstly, the European Parliament is asking that, if we take our model to be the Convention that drafted the Charter on Fundamental Rights, the four parts of which it is comprised be balanced.
In that particular Convention, there were 16 MEPs and 62 members of the Convention.
In the proposal that you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, have sent to the capitals there are still 16 MEPs, but there are 120 members of the Convention.
And I do not accept that some of these extra people are observers, because observers have exactly the same rights as everybody else, and so they should, except during participation in the final consensus.
I would also like to say, despite the words of a previous speaker, that the Commission has participated fully, and I would like to praise Commissioner Barnier' s observations, which have been very important.
However, there is still an ambiguity with regard to the word 'consensus' : consensus does not mean unanimity.
This was not the case in the Convention that drafted the Charter.
There were members of the Convention that voted against - and there is one very notable opponent amongst us today - but there was a sufficient majority, a sufficient consensus.
Therefore, let it not be said, yet again, that consensus means unanimity.
This is not true. It means final support for the resulting text.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, there is one issue that you, yourself, said is still not resolved, which is to the issue known as 'cooling' .
And as for myself, when I have to explain that after this work carried out by the one hundred and twelve people on reaching a final result, governments want to 'cool down' , things become extremely complicated.
What is this 'cooling' process?
If the result is a good one, let us adopt it immediately, then we can move on to other things.
We have enlargement to prepare for.
To conclude, Mr President, I think that we have to get rid of this fear of the Convention.
We have to remember that Europe is asking us to give a positive indication.
But what indication?
This can only be the Intergovernmental Conference.
I also hope that, at the end of this process, the indication will be a Constitution for the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the future of the European Union is, as a subject for debate, no doubt closely related to, and in part inseparable from, the reform of governance, which forms the subject of my report.
You will see, on reading it, that it is not exactly sparing with its criticisms.
It takes up a very definite stance on numerous subjects addressed by the Commission in its White Paper, and, to use a phrase currently popular in Germany, a good thing too!
It is precisely for this reason, President Prodi, that it is important to me that I thank you and your colleagues for your initiative in producing this White Paper, above all for the Commission's willingness, expressed in the White Paper, to unreservedly and even self-critically examine and change all the rules, procedures and ways the EU has of exercising its authority, in short, everything summed up in the word 'governance'.
This merits every respect, being, in fact, about nothing more or less than the reduction of the prevailing gulf between the EU and its citizens.
In this, the Commission finds in Parliament a close comrade-in-arms.
We are, as is well known, only at the beginning of the debate on the reform of governance.
Many of the Commission's proposals need to be considered in depth.
The White Paper announces several initiatives, and when they are definitely on the table, we will express our opinion of them.
I assume that certain proposals can become reality quite soon and not only at the end of next year at the earliest.
I would put under this heading the committees and working parties listed in Commissioner Kinnock's White Paper on reform of the Commission, and which are participating in the consultation procedure.
I will take this opportunity to point out that I think that every future legislative proposal could have an appendix listing all the experts, associations and organisations that played a part in drafting it.
Parliament does indeed support the improved participation and consultation that the White Paper calls for, but we take the view that this requires an interinstitutional agreement on democratic consultation, and I am pleased, President Prodi, that you have mentioned this today and given it your clear support.
President Prodi, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my report takes at length a very definite position on the issue of better lawmaking, and this is not by chance, for the fundamental issue is the role of Parliament as joint legislator.
Parliament has repeatedly emphasised that it puts its trust in the Community method, and that it sees the maintenance of the balance between the institutions as the best way to make progress towards integration.
It is not, then, some concept that we are defending, but rather its content and political essence, so I want to make it very clear today that, to put it mildly, there has been great disquiet in Parliament about the Council' s and the Commission's long-standing efforts to draft an action plan for better lawmaking, about the working parties that have already and secretly been drafting papers with the objective of putting this programme of action on the Laeken agenda - all of which has been done without involving or even informing Parliament, the joint legislator.
As item 30 of this report quite clearly states, we see this as a grave breach of the Community method.
The report therefore also demands that the action programme for better lawmaking should not be on the agenda for the Laeken Summit.
This is certainly not about this House being unwilling to take part in any consideration of how lawmaking could be simplified or even improved.
President Prodi announced today that the Commission will be producing a consultative document aimed at starting a dialogue with this House on this issue, and I can tell you that this Parliament is ready for it.
Let me say, though, and say quite emphatically, something to which we attach the highest importance: that if Parliament's legislative authority, given to it alone directly by the citizens who elected it, is restricted, Parliament will not take it lying down.
It is, especially, co-regulation that is at issue here.
The use of so-called framework directives is something we view with a highly critical eye.
There must be appropriate mechanisms of democratic control, and on this point, Mr Prodi, there are evidently differences of opinion.
We want a time-limited 'call-back mechanism'.
So I was very surprised that the Council representative made no comments on this of all issues. Better lawmaking is indeed a matter for all three institutions, and I would be interested to know what the Council Presidency has to say on this issue or on that of the proposed interinstitutional working party.
Mr President, despite all the fine words, I cannot shake off the impression that the Laeken Summit is actually intended to clean up the very soiled image of the Belgian Presidency, an attempt to brush successive howlers by the Verhofstadt-Michel government team under the carpet.
These days, one only has to read the foreign quality press, such as The Spectator and The Wall Street Journal, to realise how much damage this Belgian government is currently causing by its incompetent behaviour and, for example, by the insults which Minister Michel, present at the moment, has addressed to Austria and Italy.
That is unfortunate, for the Belgian Presidency could have easily played a significant role in this time of debate about Europe' s core tasks, about Europe' s borders and about the democratic deficit.
After all, we know from experience that the Single Belgian Federal State does not work along democratic lines and that consequently, a Single European Federal State cannot work democratically either.
We know from experience that, for example, matters of social security, are best decided at the level of the individual nations and that the principle of subsidiarity has to be followed to the letter.
We know from experience that a high level of respect is needed for linguistic and cultural differences if we are to co-exist in a proper, democratic way.
We know from experience that problems arise when people, citizens, and voters cannot identify with the political structure which decides on their fates.
In my country, Flanders, 70% of those questioned cannot name even one European institution and nearly 40% do not realise that they elect the MEPs.
Anyway, this should all be steamrollered by the Laeken propaganda machine, and in that way, the Belgian Presidency will finish as it started: insignificant and at the service of the inflated egos of a few ministers.
Mr President, the Lisbon European Council and the socio-political agenda adopted by the European Council at Nice bring us into a new phase of policy on social affairs and employment in the European Union.
As we have heard from the President-in-Office of the Council and from the President of the Commission, interest is now focussed on the quality of work and of social affairs policy.
We in this Parliament want to be fully involved in this development.
We - by which I mean the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, whose Chairman, Michel Rocard, I represent - are therefore putting an oral question to the Council and Commission, coupled with a motion for a resolution.
It is our conviction that secure jobs, favourable working conditions and appropriate workers' rights do not diminish productivity and economic growth and hence the creation of jobs, but, on the contrary, promote them.
Work for all is the objective.
We want a strategy for more and better jobs.
Quality of work involves job satisfaction, which improves employees' motivation, and health and safety at work improve as well.
We are looking to the Commission to produce a proposal on the status of temporary workers.
Moreover, quality of work involves equal treatment of both sexes, the reconciliation of work and family life, and measures to keep older people in the job market.
For this we need the most modern forms of vocational education.
There is a need for further education, in-service training and lifelong learning.
The adaptability of enterprises and their capacity to deal with structural change will be particularly important in creating new and better jobs, and minimum standards across Europe are needed to ensure that employees are involved in this, informed and consulted in due time, and thereby enabled to adjust to change.
In comparison with our economic counterparts, for example, the United States, Europe suffers from a low employment rate.
The Lisbon European Council recognised that this was a problem and proposed an ambitious objective for progressively increasing this rate.
It is absolutely vital that we achieve this objective.
The Commission has presented a communication in preparation for the Laeken Summit, in which it sets down the outlines of a strategy for promoting quality of work and social affairs policy.
The drawing-up of appropriate indicators and criteria, as Mr Prodi informed us, is not the least important of these, but is primary.
As I said at the outset, Parliament expects to be fully involved in discussions.
It is our ever more frequent experience that European social affairs policy is carried on by dialogue between sub-committees of the Council - for example the Employment Committee or the Social Protection Committee - and the Commission.
Parliament is often left out in the cold.
We protest against this.
Parliament must be able to play its rightful part in formulating proposals on subjects such as employment and social protection which, after all, are of immediate concern to all citizens.
If we are to do this, the relevant specialised fora and the Commission have to keep us up to date with the work they are doing, and Parliament has to be consulted in good time before every European Council.
We expect a clear pledge on this from the Laeken summit.
We are, at the end of the day, the representatives of the people and therefore, in essence, the primary organ of the European Union.
President Prodi just used a very fine expression in describing Parliament as the most important expression of democratic Europe.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President, it is for these reasons that we look forward to your answers to our oral questions.
Mr President, after Mr Barón Crespo' s speech, there remains very little for me to say on this matter.
I am going to refer to the Commission White Paper, and also to the mysterious Council document, the Mandelkern report, to which reference has been made, but of which we have no knowledge.
The two documents deal with the legislative powers of Parliament.
Mr Prodi has made a commitment not to put forward any proposal to the Laeken European Council, and it seems right, in fact, that these issues will not be discussed at Laeken, because, in short, these are issues that affect the very essence of the process of drafting a new European Constitution and which should, therefore, be in the Convention itself, and, possibly, at the Intergovernmental Conference.
What we have to do here is to establish the legislative competences of the European Institutions, and make it clear that, of all the European Institutions, it is the organ of popular representation, the European Parliament, that holds the mandate for this popular representation.
The wording of the White Paper, relating to the powers of enforcement, to self-regulation and coregulation procedures, and to the Lisbon strategy, are all aimed at cutting back Parliament' s limited legislative powers.
Mr President, I have one minute indeed, and it is outrageous, in my view, for draftsmen of the opinion to be apportioned a meagre one minute of speaking time on such a weighty matter.
Overall, Nice has failed to come up with the goods, but as for the areas of competence of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, of whose opinion I have the honour of being the draftsman, the situation is not actually that bad.
I would particularly refer to the improvements made at our initiative to the workings of the European legal system.
The major concern which the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market wishes to express, therefore, is that whatever the fate of the Treaty of Nice may be, the positive changes which I alluded to a moment ago should enter into effect independently of the overall ratification of Nice.
With regard to the Laeken Declaration itself, to put it succinctly, the European Union must show itself prepared to meet the challenges that lie ahead.
It must focus on its core tasks and carry out its tasks properly.
In this connection, the European citizen expects Laeken to send out a clear signal that a great deal of work is being put into a European security policy, both internal and external.
I have been as generous as I can, Mr De Clercq, but one has to recognise the time that is allocated to your Committee.
Mr President, I am pleased that Mr Prodi is here to listen to this.
The Environment Committee is very unhappy with the idea of voluntary agreements, as a way of proceeding.
We want to see a legal framework for them because we believe that this is far too much like secret law-making.
We are not at all happy about the co-regulatory approach - whatever that may be - because we see that as a way of moving away from binding legal instruments, which can sideline democratic control.
Mr Prodi will know that we are very happy with the idea of publishing expert advice.
We are grateful for what crumbs we receive and would like to see sometimes the authorship of the legislation which we then tear apart.
On the question of implementation, we are very worried about the application of the law and I quote "in a way that takes account of regional and local conditions".
We feel it would be better to draw up the law in a more flexible way in the first place.
If you are going to take account of regional and local conditions, it probably means that you are going to upset the conditions of fair and equal competition.
We see a great need for the Commission to devote more energy to the issue of implementation and we see no real need to establish criteria to focus its work in investigating possible breaches of the law.
What they need is more staff.
Finally, I recommend to Mr Prodi to read the occasional paper produced by the European Policy Centre on regulatory impact analysis.
It provides the idea of having a regulatory impact analysis on all new legislation to assess the need for it, to examine alternatives and to examine its overall impact.
It would include, and this may not recommend itself to Mr Prodi or his staff, the idea of a specific regulatory assessment office in the office of the Commission Secretary-General.
I think that would be a very good idea.
Mr President, five principles form the basis of the Commission' s reform of the EU' s forms of governance: openness, participation, efficiency, consistency and a clear division of responsibilities.
The work on these areas cannot be regarded as being complete if one half of humanity is ignored.
No one can say they are working for participation if they do not guarantee that it is both women and men who are participating.
Our Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities called for a council on equality to be set up to, for example, gather information and analyse trends; for women' s rights groups and non-governmental organisations to be part of the database on civil society that the Commission intends to set up; and for considerations of equality to be integrated into information gathering at both national and local level, because women' s and men' s priorities, circumstances and needs often differ.
It is unfortunate that none of our demands has been incorporated into the report.
Mr President, the debate on the future of Europe must be conducted in a very responsible manner if it is not to end in failure, as happened with the intergovernmental method at Nice.
We must recognise the legitimacy of the European citizenship of the citizens of the Member States, for this, too, will help to bring the European institutions closer to the citizens once again.
Today, we have to take into account the way the interinstitutional organisations' systems have developed, and the more sophisticated this development becomes the more it widens the gap between the citizens and the institutions.
When the institutions work properly, problems do not arise, but when they do not work properly - and the number of petitions we receive is evidence of the considerable gap between the institutions and the citizens - the citizens are wronged by the institutions.
Our positive response must be to strengthen the institutions which safeguard the rights of the Union' s citizens.
The Committee on Petitions has been forced to issue an extremely critical opinion on the Commission' s proposals on good governance, for it has found no reference in them either to the European Ombudsman or to the Committee on Petitions' role as the institutional body which safeguards the rights of the citizens, who indeed petition it to uphold their rights.
The proposals for good governance do not appear to contain any significant element that might succeed in bringing the citizens closer to Europe.
This endeavour could be said to be effective in theory but, in actual fact, to have no genuine impact.
Lastly, we hope that it will be possible to make the obscure role of the Council clearer, at least by advertising the institution' s sittings when it is legislating, to avoid the impression of it being a huge black hole.
I recommend the points made in these reports to the other European institutions, for I am sure that Parliament is the only body with democratic legitimacy.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, there are only two observations I wish to make, and they overlap with each other.
I believe that the European Union's practical policy after 11 September has made it clear, through the behaviour of a number of Member States which indulged in bilateralism or appeared enraptured by their own managerial airs and graces, that the European Union is strong wherever it works in accordance with the Community method, and weak wherever it does not.
That is the lesson to be learned from the past two or three months; it shows us how necessary general reform of the European Union is if this approach, which weakens us, is not to recur in future.
The conclusion to be drawn from this is that it is important that we find the right mechanism at Laeken, where the European Council will not yet, essentially, be deciding on content, but where success will depend on the methods by which the content is worked out.
One thing, I believe, must be clear. If there is to be a Convention which owes its existence to the help given by the Presidency, a number of Member States and the Commission, and in which Members of this Parliament and of the national parliaments take part, then it must not be a Convention whose procedures are conceived in such a way that it does not have the room to manoeuvre needed if the right decisions are to be reached.
Nor must it lack a procedure that can serve as the basis for the final negotiations by the Heads of State and of Government.
It is, above all else, unacceptable that so much time is allowed to elapse between the Convention and the summit that the old method of the diplomatic governmental conference destroys all the political momentum built up by parliamentarians.
I believe that this will be the decisive test by which Laeken will stand or fall.
I wish you a great deal of success, knowing as I do that you, in the Council and in the Commission, share this view that these positions must be made to prevail so that we can work together with a view to a result acceptable to all.
The Convention marks the start of a new European Constitution, a bold vision of Europe' s future, a euro which is not suffering from monetary isolation but which is being embedded in socio-economic policy, a European Commission which is transformed into a European government, European elections with European lists of candidates and with people heading the lists of candidates who, via the European Parliament, can produce a president for the European Commission.
We would like more qualified majority votes in the Council and more codecision in the European Parliament.
The Council meetings must become public, allowing national parliaments to adequately monitor the Council Ministers.
We look forward to close cooperation between the European Parliament and the national parliaments.
This is a vision and the possible shape of things to come.
The Convention should look to reach consensus rather than draft a catalogue with no strings attached.
The Convention must enter into an open dialogue with civil society, for part of Europe' s future lies in more European cooperation in those fields where citizens expect to see cross-border results, including food safety, immigration, environmental pollution, international crime and terrorism.
However, an equal share of the areas of policy could be apportioned to the regions and civil society.
I am thus in favour of more positive subsidiarity.
We must avoid a situation of Europe-autism and therefore focus on innovative institutional restructuring which goes hand in hand with cooperation in the various fields of policy.
Bringing about new types of European administration means adopting a more open working method and result-focused approach.
We will achieve this by introducing new instruments, such as co- and self-regulation and open coordination, but, in the event of failure, we must have the assurance that we can fall back on call-back mechanisms.
I am pleased with the resolutions before us.
As the European Parliament, let us today choose in favour of a new, transparent form of European administration and let us vote in favour of the Convention, thus ensuring a democratic future for Europe.
Mr President, in February 1787, a previous convention met in Philadelphia.
Several of the American States were opposed to calling the thing in the first place and several others were determined to restrict its mandate and to dilute its effect.
The convention's formal brief was extremely restrictive and it was not itself to decide but only propose.
Yet from that experiment flowered the American Constitution and the post-colonial parliamentary democracy that we still recognise today.
Such a similar result will only come out of this European Convention, if we as a Parliament are bold, well-organised and persuasive.
Beneath the Presidency of our European George Washington, we must draft a clear set of proposals and, while accepting the questions set for us by Laeken, we must retain the capacity to ask ourselves some questions.
Let us be truly creative for Europe.
Mr President, the Union already has implicitly in the Treaties the bones of a Constitution.
We all look to the Convention to make it explicit and clear and to create the proper legal framework for a thoroughly democratic Europe.
That, of course, will involve, as has been said in parts of this debate, fully recognising the prerogatives and powers of this great all-European Parliamentary Assembly.
But democracy at this level will not be effective unless it is also fully effective at the level of the little battalions: at the level of the local authorities, at the level of the constitutional regions, the self-governing internal nations of the Member States.
Now that means that the Convention must look to that question as well, and improving governance in Europe must, as the Commission has said, look closely at the proper involvement of regional and local authorities.
I thought that the Commission was somewhat timid in what they said about that, but alas, Parliament argues yet further timidity and talks down all the references in the White Paper to regional involvement with the Commission.
Recital M and Paragraph 26 are to be deeply regretted as currently phrased in Mrs Kaufmann's otherwise admirable report.
We want to see these amended.
We want to see a strengthening of the reference to the necessary involvement of the Commission and Parliament with the regional and local authorities, as well as with national parliaments.
We do not want to subvert the constitutional framework of Europe.
We want to improve it.
Mr President, the Laeken Summit is to form the basis of a new EU treaty.
The European Parliament' s resolution demands that this change to the treaties results in a constitution for the EU, that is to say, a decisive step of sorts on the way to a federal state.
I believe that something essential has been forgotten, namely that the Irish people have made use of their right to reject the Treaty of Nice.
This right, and this rejection of the treaty by the Irish people, should be respected at the Laeken Summit and a statement made to the effect that the Treaty should be rewritten.
The message from Ireland is clear: less centralism and supranationalism and more respect for national democracy.
What we need are treaty changes along the following lines: openness in the Council of Ministers, with the opportunity to monitor decisions by the national parliaments, at the same time as the national parliaments are given the opportunity to propose laws instead of this right' s being located in the Commission bureaucracy.
This is an important debate and I would like to compliment the Commission on its publication of the White Paper on European Governance.
In light of recent developments, it is obvious that it is a time for stocktaking but there can be no doubt about the relevance of the European Union to Member States and its citizens.
In most respects the European Union has lived up to the ideals and aspirations of Europe's founding fathers.
The achievement of peace alone justifies our existence but we have achieved much more, not least the fact that the ideals enshrined in the Treaty of Rome - of assisting economic and social development of small and under-developed countries - have by and large also been achieved.
Ireland bears witness to this fact and, despite the outcome of the Nice Treaty, Irish people readily acknowledge the benefits of our membership and also support proposals on enlargement.
So what has gone wrong?
We have failed, in my view, to communicate Europe.
Citizens do not feel part of the European family.
Their perceived isolation from the decision-making process has left them frustrated and cold.
That sense of abandonment has led to the apathy and indifference as demonstrated by the lower turnout in recent European elections and, in Ireland's case, rejection of the Nice Treaty.
The Commission and Parliament are right about one thing, the EU lacks democratic legitimacy.
Furthermore, no layman, nor many MEPs, really understand how the whole thing works.
The White Paper and this report are all part of a hard sell, the idea being to sell the EU concept to our citizens more aggressively so that the people will learn to love it.
Beneath all of this is the interinstitutional battle and both Mr Prodi and Parliament are desperate to preserve the Community method, fearing there is too much intergovernmentalism about.
Whoever wins this battle between the institutions will make no difference to ordinary people.
It is time to put the true intentions of the EU project to the electorate in each Member State.
Only then will we know whether they want to be a part of it and whether the project can ever work.
But perhaps after Ireland, Denmark and Switzerland, that may be taking democracy a stage too far for all of you.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Leinen have, once again, presented us with a truly sophisticated report, but I feel that they have dwelled a little too much on methodology.
It is, of course, better to have a speedboat rather than a rowing boat, as you can go faster in the speedboat, but if you do not know where you are going, you are not at so great an advantage.
I welcomed the comments made by Mr Poettering, Mr Cox and Mr Voggenhuber, who, for the first time in a long while, focused on the issue of the Commission in their speeches.
In my view, we are now facing a very serious problem.
We have a fight on our hands.
There is a tug of war going on between the Council and Parliament.
We are increasing our powers of co-decision, but, at the same time, we are in the process of destroying the Commission.
In doing so, we are introducing further bureaucracy, and I do not think there is any point, Mrs Theorin, in discussing transparency, governance, co-decision and democratic legitimacy, when we cannot even talk about electing the Commission by direct universal suffrage.
I believe that the balance of our institutions depends on this and that we cannot run our economy along the same lines as the great American model.
It is the balance of our institutions, the check and balance, the division of powers, and not how to share the cake between the various institutions that our discussions, our debates and the Intergovernmental Conference, as well as the imminent Convention, should focus on.
I think that this is the only way to fight against further bureaucracy, the only way to once again make our institutions meaningful, the only way to reinvigorate European integration.
So, as Mr Salafranca said, there are no favourable winds for those who have no clue where they are going, and I think that, first and foremost, the problem that Parliament has is to know and understand in which direction it wants to travel.
Mr President, President Prodi, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs showed, by our unanimous adoption of the Kaufmann report, our ability, in the very short time available to us, to act in concert and respond to important reform proposals from the Commission, on which we will be able to take up a position either today or tomorrow, just in time for the European Summit at Laeken.
Let me just pick out a few points from the Kaufmann report and highlight the following: Mr Prodi, we are delighted to learn that you are sticking with the joint working party proposed in October.
What matters now is that we get it moving quickly and start collaborating appropriately on the subject matter in hand.
We, in the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats insist in any case on an early start being made on this work.
We are glad that the Commission of the European Union has given up developing what would have been, in effect, its own administrative structures right down through the regions, towns and local communities, as we read about, for example, in preliminary drafts of its White Paper.
It is also our opinion that it is fundamentally unacceptable that the Commission should adopt a method of open coordination, bypassing its co-legislator Parliament, with guidelines sanctioned only by the Council of Ministers and with the Commission using the financial reins of the programmes to set their general course.
Here, too, the co-legislator needs to be involved.
We urge you to undertake an in-depth reform of the comitological procedure.
It is not acceptable that, with the help of the national bureaucracies, Parliament's legislative prerogative should be made null and void by means of implementing provisions whose content, purpose and extent are not laid down in advance.
We also demand that European agencies be kept to a minimum.
May we remind you that the Commission and the European Parliament are born allies when it comes to the promotion of European integration and action in the interests of Europe's citizens?
The transposition of European legislation requires at every level its own culture of public administration, which must also embrace the application of European rules through the authorities in the Member States.
There is an urgent need for appropriate instruction and training of civil servants at these levels.
Thank you, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, this debate is, in fact, far too early to be able to rate the chances of success of the Laeken Summit realistically, but, Mr President-in-Office, it is already a fact that the Belgian Presidency will be memorable, even if it was only because the attack on New York has put the fight against terrorism and Europe' s role in the world, at the top of the list of priorities.
For my group, it is vital for the Laeken Summit to spell out once more that we have our own contribution to make, especially in the search for political and diplomatic solutions for international conflicts, with full backing from the UN institutions, and that we also want to reactivate the dialogue with the Arab States.
The EU' s own role means, inter alia, that Europe refuses to ignore or suspend the principles of the rule of law and human rights in the name of the fight against terrorism, and that Europe insists on justice in the framework of an international court of justice and not in the framework of exceptional courts.
Mr President-in-Office, I hope that Laeken will drive home this clear message to the United States, among others.
Nevertheless, the risk remains that this priority could push aside the sixteen other priorities.
That is why, on behalf of my group, I would like to convey a wish to the Council Presidency. We expect the Council Presidency to make an extra effort at the Laeken Summit to clarify that the Lisbon objectives also apply at a time when we face economic decline, when companies are being restructured and unemployment continues to rise.
It is important for the Laeken Summit to demonstrate to people that Europe is not just about the introduction of the euro. It is also about economic growth, employment, the future of pensions and the fight against social exclusion.
Mr President-in-Office, Laeken' s pièce de résistance will undoubtedly be the declaration about the future of Europe.
This declaration is still one of the Prime Minister' s personal projects with which he, in the capacity of President-in-Office of the Council, is doing the rounds of the capital cities.
As the draft document is still a well kept secret for this Parliament too, we are having to make our contribution to the declaration without, in fact, any knowledge of the content of this document.
I find this regrettable.
That is why I should like to pass on a few suggestions which are extremely important to us in the framework of the declaration on the future of the European Union.
First of all, we must avoid a situation where the Laeken Declaration sets up scenarios whereby the competences of the European Union are cast in stone, thus not allowing Europe any room for manoeuvre where this is not explicitly provided for in the Treaty, or a scenario in which use is made of lists of competences.
Mr President-in-Office, such scenarios certainly do not meet the expectations of the citizens.
Secondly, there is the risk, if I can believe the lobbies, that Europe' s voice will be somewhat drowned out by that of the delegations of the Member States.
We trust that Laeken will launch a balanced Convention and that, furthermore, the participation of women will be guaranteed.
Thirdly, Mr President-in-Office, I was taken by surprise a moment ago when I heard you say - and I hope I did not misunderstand you - that "l'idée d'une assemblée parallèle au forum de la société civile a été écartée" .
This is very bad news, for it is obvious to me that the debate on the future of Europe is already being compromised if the civil society is not accorded a clear status, if a structured platform for a dialogue with the civil organisations is not really being created and if all that remains is a virtual computer debate with no room for real participation.
I hope that this can still be rectified in Laeken, but I would nevertheless wish the Council Presidency every success at this stage.
Mr President, you said that openness, efficiency and bringing the EU closer to the people were to be important issues at Laeken.
I could not agree with you more about that.
Following the not entirely successful compromise in Nice, the Irish referendum and, according to many opinion polls, growing scepticism towards the EU project in quite a few Member States, there are high expectations of the Laeken Summit, with changes to the EU anticipated.
The EU must become more intelligible and citizen-friendly.
A clear constitution is needed, explaining how the EU is governed and who does what.
The EU must cut back on the work it does and concentrate on the cross-border problems.
I do not believe people want the EU to do more in all areas. Instead, they want it to deliver the goods in those areas it has made its own, taking decisions openly.
It is completely unacceptable for it to legislate behind the closed doors of the Council of Ministers.
If it is to be possible to simultaneously enlarge and deepen the EU, we must involve people and win back their trust.
That is not something we can do through fine declarations and constitutional exercises of an academic nature, but through genuine reforms and political courage.
I hope the rest of the European Council is as courageous as the Belgian Presidency.
Mr President, I would just like to reiterate what the rapporteur, Mr Méndez de Vigo, said just now.
There is no sense in setting up a Convention and then doing our level best to stop it succeeding.
What do we mean by 'succeeding' ?
Success means achieving substantial progress towards a stronger, more integrated Union, which will inevitably involve reducing the role and powers of each State, that is the problem, Mr Michel, and increasing the role and powers of the common institutions.
This is your responsibility now as European Council, and this is the decision you must make: to reduce your powers.
At Nice, you failed precisely because the intergovernmental method is an obstacle in itself, in that it favours those who are lagging behind and forces everyone to conform to their slow pace.
The President-in-Office, Mr Michel, and President Prodi have been through some really tough times in recent months, times when the lack of joint instruments was starkly and sometimes cruelly clear.
I feel that the Convention, a genuine Convention, should be an embryonic constituent assembly, and that it is the only thing that can make the future of the European Union brighter than the confusion which reigns at present.
Mr President, with regard to the European strategy to promote quality in employment and in social policy, announcing and adopting plans is not enough: quality employment with rights must be created and tangible objectives must be set to ensure that all social rights are respected.
Creating jobs is not enough: they must not be precarious, employees must be able to live with dignity and must be paid on time, unlike the current situation in Portugal, which, despite the low official rate of unemployment, still has the lowest salaries in the European Union, and where job insecurity is growing worse, the number of companies that are behind in paying their employees is increasing and it is becoming more and more difficult to develop areas that are reaching crisis point.
A policy seeking to achieve quality in social terms calls for priority to be given to employment with rights, with particular emphasis on women and young people, including their training, but also on pay and contracts, and special attention must also be given to the elderly and to pensions, especially minimum pensions, which means that the European Union cannot continue to insist on giving absolute priority to the monetary policies of the Stability Pact, as it is still doing.
Mr President, in our view, the draft declaration that the Laeken Council is due to publish to shape the debate on the future of the Union seems to have been drafted under some very odd circumstances.
According to press reports, the Belgian Presidency says that it deliberately did not release the document to its partners too early, so that they would not have the time to rewrite the text.
This is not a very co-operative way of working and this is what leads us to warn the members of the Council: do not forget that you are representing countries and national democracies, which should have a free hand in these negotiations.
The ideal scenario would be to initially establish an interparliamentary forum consisting of representatives of the national parliaments or which works on the basis of proposals from the national parliaments, as the latter are well placed to sum up the feelings of each nation.
In any case, I would say to the Heads of State and Government, do not allow a mechanism to be imposed upon you that would lead to proposals being made that are out of touch with the interests and preferences of our people.
This is a point that I will explain in greater depth in my explanation of vote on the resolution that will be tabled.
Mr President, many Christian-Democrats have played a leading role at each stage of the development of the European Union, and even now we want to make a joint effort in order to turn Europe into a lasting success story.
The Nice Summit, which was supposed to be the summit of truth, cannot really be described as a run-away success, certainly not in terms of its intention to properly prepare the Union' s institutions for enlargement.
The Heads of State and Government will now hopefully realise that they can no longer afford any half-hearted or premature conclusions at Laeken.
The report by Mr Leinen and Mr Méndez de Vigo indicates very clearly what decisions are crucial to secure a bright future for the Union.
We back this report and I should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteurs warmly on their work.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your work is not complete, and neither is the term of your Presidency.
It would therefore be premature to draw up an assessment of your Presidency at this stage, but pending the Laeken Summit, I should still like to say the following.
We have noted, and this is also evident from opinion polls, that European citizens have given up.
They are not really turning against Europe, but they no longer feel involved.
Therefore, more attention should be devoted to issues such as: more information, more public debate, more openness towards the NGOs, making it clear that the Union' s objectives do have a bearing on every single person and that the Union shows equal respect for every human being.
In this connection, I would call on you as Head of Government of a small country not to allow yourself to be pushed into a corner again, as was the case in Ghent and in London, in fact.
People cannot understand this and accept this even less.
I would also urge you to continue to guarantee the same respect for all languages and their users.
I would therefore urge you to discontinue your planned intentions concerning the use of language in the bureaus for the protection of industrial right of ownership.
People do not understand this, neither do they want or accept this.
They do not want a second-rate language, and neither do they want to be treated like second-class citizens.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will just mention five points in the short time available to me.
Firstly, I welcome the Convention. It is not a constituent assembly but it is all we could realistically achieve.
Secondly, we need to be careful not to undervalue or trivialise the term 'European Constitution' , and the members of the Convention need to be courageous and innovative in their role.
Thirdly, federalism must not be a matter just for the States and the European Union, with the basic regional and local levels and linguistic and national minorities being excluded.
Fourthly, with regard to the method, Commissioner Barnier is right to talk about 'maximum consensus' . We are not aiming at unanimity on the reforms.
Fifthly and lastly: the timetable.
We must beware of excessively long delays between the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference supposed to adopt the European Constitution, for it is an unfortunate fact that enthusiasm for reforms wanes fast.
Mr President, Mr Leinen and Mr Méndez de Vigo's model of a Convention sets out an accessible and also, I hope, successful way ahead into Europe's future.
I also agree with your desire, in response to statement 23, for an enlarged agenda which, however, the Convention should set for itself.
Even such an enlarged agenda, though, offers little hope of achieving the desired result, namely a single basis for decision-making.
I am far more inclined to think that the possibility suggests itself of submitting to the Council various options which could also take account of the different positions.
I know that on one point I stand quite alone, although I am in the right.
I wish to reiterate my warning against setting an earlier date for the Intergovernmental Conference planned for Nice in 2004, because I am firmly convinced that the people would see it as an evasion of their vote.
If, as all sides in the House maintain, we really are striving for an open debate which is accessible to the public, then nothing could be better suited to that than to include the themes in the next European elections.
Mr President, the Belgian Presidency has played a major role in completing some of the groundwork for the Union' s enlargement.
One is indeed struck by the optimism which is taking possession of those involved: the naming of the date 2004 suggests that the work is nearly finished.
There is even talk of a big bang of ten countries acceding simultaneously.
Commissioner Verheugen is sensible enough to state that it is possible that up to ten new countries will join in 2004.
After all, it is not up to us to determine an accession date for the candidate countries.
The year 2004 is an assumption and a hope, but holds no guarantees for any Member State whatsoever.
We, and they, should therefore continue to make every effort to achieve a sound and credible result.
A great deal needs to be done within the current Union in order to clarify the significance of enlargement.
Naturally, many are right to be truly enthusiastic about this fantastic, historic process.
But under the influence of those who believe they can secure political gain from xenophobic sentiments, a climate of uncertainty has emerged.
False representations of the costs involved in the enlargement are doing the rounds.
They are designed to instil fear and are based on worst-case scenarios: as if it has not been clear for a very long time that the cost of this whole enlargement process would be covered by the EU budget.
Far more important is greater awareness of the need for anchoring more firmly the character of the Union as a union of democratic constitutional states.
The events of 11 September have illustrated this more clearly than ever.
The fight against serious crime and terrorism is a common cause, and reticence in this connection will jeopardise the safety of citizens.
It is actually very strange that our union of constitutional states, as such, has not resulted in greater trust among the Member States and their legal systems.
A great deal will need to be done about this in the coming years.
May I offer my congratulations to the co-rapporteurs for an excellent report and also to the Belgian Presidency for having carried the idea, born in Parliament, of preparing the next Intergovernmental Conference by means of a Convention nearly to fruition, although we still have the Laeken Summit to come.
This is a dramatic improvement on the preparations of previous Intergovernmental Conferences.
Instead of the usual group of foreign ministry officials meeting together behind closed doors we will have a publicly representative body taking ideas from a wide public debate and coming up with a coherent set of proposals for reform.
This is a tremendous opportunity but does not guarantee results and it is for us to make something of it.
We will do so if we avoid divisions on the theology or vocabulary of European integration where we are sometimes divided on the word even though we are united on the substance.
Let me give a couple of examples: in some political parties and countries the word "federalism" is mistakenly equated with centralism and they talk of creating a centralised super-state in the way that Mr Farage spoke earlier.
That is not what anybody wants and if you define federalism as different levels of governance, as decentralised as possible but centralised where necessary with each level democratically structured, then we already have the beginnings of a federal-type system and I am happy, under that definition, to proclaim myself a federalist.
In some countries the word "constitution" is an almost sacred text that has emerged after revolution or after national independence.
In other countries such as the United Kingdom it is a more pragmatic concept.
In that pragmatic sense we already have a European constitution, not a very good one, but we have it and we should improve it further.
The constitution is the Treaties which lay down the field of competence of the EU, the powers of the institutions, the legislative and the budgetary procedures.
Let us recognise that de facto they form our constitution.
Let us improve our constitution by firstly codifying it to make it simple and clear in a single text so that citizens can see how this constitution operates, and secondly by clarifying it in several ways: clarifying the responsibilities, what the Union is and is not responsible for and clarifying the structures.
Let me give one example of confusion that we have now.
The functions of Mr Solana and Mr Patten should be merged into a single individual to represent the Union externally, perhaps with a special status as a specially appointed Vice-President of the Commission.
Finally, as regards clarity and democratic accountability: it is essential that all legislation passes the two tests of acceptability to the Council representing the States and acceptability to Parliament representing the citizens, a double guarantee as to the quality and acceptability of European legislation.
I said this is an opportunity, but it is not a guarantee.
We must fight to make the necessary changes come about through the Convention.
Mr President, in the opinion of the Liberal Group the Convention must suggest alternative prototypes for the development of the EU.
One of these alternatives is the trend (currently underway) towards a federal state.
The supranational Commission would be developed into a federal government, exercising executive power and directing the Union's legislation; this would operate subject to the confidence of the supranational European Parliament.
The Council of Ministers would be developed as the Parliament's second chamber.
Along with this federal model, we must consider a structure which will be built upon the principles of an association of states.
Here, the leading body would be a reformed Council of Ministers made up of representatives of the Member States.
Since the Council would hold the right of initiative, it would not be able to operate in its present manner as a legislative chamber representing the Member States.
In this case, alongside the supranational Parliament there would be a second chamber formed in order to strengthen the position of the Member States, which would be composed of members of the national parliaments.
This type of decentralised association of states is, in my opinion, better suited to an expanding European Union than a centralised federal model.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to start by congratulating the two rapporteurs, Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Leinen, for their sterling work and the manner in which they have conducted themselves, for want of a better word, from start to finish in order to include as many ideas and views of the Members of the European Parliament in their reports as possible.
Obviously, there are as many excellent and interesting ideas, visions and proposals for the future of Europe as there are responses to the challenges facing the European Union.
However, not one idea, vision or proposal can be implemented or can bring in results unless the right method is used to put flesh on the bones of these visions and proposals.
And the right method is none other than a convention, a body which needs to reflect accurately all the current political forces in Europe.
The work of this convention, which we believe should be the subject of the fullest democratic dialogue, should result in a proposal which is a synthesis and product of all the views formulated at it.
Only thus will the foundations on which the Europe of the future is built be more representative, more democratic and, hence, more efficient, not to mention permanent and equitable.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, I know that you are in a hurry and must go, but I would like to thank you very much for keeping the promise you made to Members of this House, to bring nothing to Laeken on which a decision had already been made, and for being so determined that there should be an interinstitutional working party.
Such cooperation with Parliament is quite exemplary, and I wish to thank you most warmly for it.
I would, though, also like to extend my warm thanks to the rapporteurs, Mr Leinen, Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mrs Kaufmann for having focussed their excellent reports so well on the vital importance to us of making Europe's decision-making structures more democratic and more efficient and for pointing out that there must be no contradiction in this, much as that might have appeared to be the case here and there, with elements of democracy having to be sacrificed for efficiency's sake.
Both as regards the Convention and legislation, what matters to us is that we, as the people's directly elected Members of Parliament, are convinced, not that we can do everything, which would be quite false, but that we should have control of the decision-making process.
Mr President of the Commission, some small differences may well still be there.
We want this 'call back position' only in the event of a delegated decision-making structure being incapable or coming to the wrong decisions - wrong, that is, in the sense of being contrary to what the legislature intended.
It would be better, and is always good, for others to reach decisions along the lines that we have indicated in our fundamental decisions and political approach.
I hope, firstly, that the Council is now willing to set up this interinstitutional working party soon, and, secondly, that we will be able, taking the Mandelkern and Kaufmann reports and the Commission's Final Conclusions as our basis, to conclude the Agreement as early as June next year, or, at least, that the Council will be able, next June, to agree that the three institutions have found a way to take Europe into a future which will be more highly developed and marked both by democracy and efficiency.
Mr President, the issue of European governance is such a complex problem, and one that our fellow citizens have difficulty in understanding, which is, in itself, a paradox.
We all know that Europe is suffering from a serious democratic deficit, and that is why there is obviously a need to radically reform the way in which powers are exercised at European level.
We must do so and bear in mind three objectives, namely to clarify the decision-making process, to improve the efficiency and transparency of this process, and to encourage the involvement of citizens.
That is why I support the guidelines contained in the White Paper and the Kaufmann report.
We must, of course, ensure there is greater transparency in the Council' s work, we must encourage the European Parliament and the national parliaments to play a greater role in the legislative process. We must simplify Community legislation and make it possible to undertake genuine consultation with civil society.
Furthermore, I think it is worthwhile, as the Committee on Constitutional Affairs stressed, to draw up an inter-institutional agreement on co-legislation, to guarantee that the European Parliament plays an effective role and fulfils its political responsibility.
The reform of governance is therefore a step in the right direction.
However, it will obviously not be a substitute for the radical reform that our institutions need so badly.
We must provide ourselves, as soon as possible, with a simple and understandable constitution, clearly defining the division of competences, clarifying everyone' s role so that citizens finally understand who does what, and so that they can know who is responsible.
Lastly, as everyone in this House knows, we cannot have democratic power without democratic legitimacy.
That is why the President of the European executive must one day, and one day soon, I hope, be elected by universal suffrage.
Mr President, the Laeken Summit will be a major but difficult summit, particularly because of the importance of the subjects that will be debated.
In this brief speech, I would just like to focus on the institutional elements of the summit.
The Convention must concentrate on instigating a new phase which will produce a Constitution leading to the creation of a federation of nation States, but it must also establish the competences of the various institutions: the Commission, the Council, the Member States, the regions and the major cities.
These are decisions which will have to be made under the banner of solidarity and subsidiarity, two values which must inspire our new Constitution.
The Laeken Council will also have to discuss the timetable for this progression towards the new institutions.
Indeed, we must ensure that decisions which are fundamental for the future of the Union are not taken at the time of the electoral campaign.
That is why we feel it would be appropriate to initiate the Intergovernmental Conference earlier than planned, during the Italian Presidency in the second half of 2003.
Clearly, the people must be involved in the process of creating a Constitution through the votes of the parliaments - for example, we would have preferred Parliament to have been given the opportunity to debate and amend the Nice Charter for there are parts of it, particularly those regarding the individual, which are wholly unconvincing - especially regarding the European Parliament, for without the involvement of the citizens and their representatives we will not be able to transform the Europe of the euro into a political Europe which can enlarge its borders in the future, maybe even as far as the Yurals: in other words, a great Europe which will bring a long, lasting period of peace.
Mr President, I am going to concentrate on the legal issues, which are what is most worrying right now when it comes to the structural aspects of the EU.
The Council is in danger of infringing Articles 8 and 10 of the European Council Convention, together with Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, freedom of expression, respect for private life and the protection of personal data.
That is something people cannot do much about.
Because there is no balance of power in the legal area, the terrorist legislation, which is entirely necessary, is in danger of undermining democracy in the long term.
The intergovernmental model is out of date.
The European Parliament must become a co-legislator and the EU' s Court of Justice be given full powers.
The Council cannot be turned into a so-called state within a state.
On 11 September, the EU' s structure in terms of pillars ceased to be at all effective.
External and internal security issues became ever more closely connected.
Vigorous measures to combat terrorism and serious crime are now required.
These must nonetheless go hand in hand with increased public control and legal protection, especially when it comes to what are known as the principles of due process, such as, no punishment without law, proportionality, the presumption of innocence and the right to a defence and to be tried before an impartial court.
These rights must become unconditional at EU level.
The Laeken Summit must signal the start of openness and democracy, which are prerequisites for successful enlargement.
They require a convention on a mainly parliamentary basis, obviously with a substantial number of members from the EU institution closest to the people.
The Convention should be able to work towards producing a proposal, so that people in future know what it is they are to adopt a position on.
Anyone who wants to develop the EU and make it better and larger should support the thinking that is being done in terms of devising a constitution which is characterised by an effective division of power and which, it is to be hoped, will develop out of today' s excellent reports.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no democracy without a Parliament.
Today again we find that the European Parliament is the principal integrating element in the European Union.
Nowhere else do Council, Commission and Parliament engage in public discussion, not always achieving unanimity, but openly, and, I hope, constructively.
Our three rapporteurs have presented excellent reports.
This Parliament has, since Nice, been pressing forward with a Community process which must burst forth in Laeken.
I share President Prodi's concern that the European Union is not yet adequately equipped to cope with enlargement, and so I ask the President-in-Office of the Council to check again, and check carefully, whether what was decided in Nice really does enhance the working capacity of the Council and of Parliament.
I doubt it.
The European Community and European Union have developed splendidly over the past nearly fifty years to date, and I hope that the next fifty years will be prepared for in such a way that we can work even better in the European Union over the next fifty years.
Mr President, the forthcoming summit in Laeken will be an extremely important meeting.
At this summit, the agenda will need to be drawn up for the Convention which has to submit the reform proposals for the European institutions. And everyone knows how important agendas are for the outcome of consultations.
We are happy with the planned make-up of the Convention, except that I should like to add that it is important to strike a political balance.
This will mainly be the responsibility of the national parliaments.
Furthermore, I am also of the opinion that the chairman of the Convention should be elected by the Convention itself.
With regard to the agenda for the IGC of 2003-2004, the Council has naturally included the four points of Declaration 23 appended to the Treaty of Nice.
I should like to briefly comment on these four points.
As far as the demarcation of powers is concerned, we are in favour of a more federal structure of the European Union, with a clear distribution of tasks among the Union, the Member States and regions.
Concerning the structure of the future treaties, we endorse a basic treaty with a constitutional character which must also include the Charter.
In respect of the role of the national parliaments, we believe that they must primarily encourage and monitor their own ministers in the supervision of the implementation of European policy.
Are there any more topics for the Convention?
Yes, I should like to outline five.
The common foreign and security policy must be included in the Community Pillar.
The policy in the field of police, justice and criminal law must also fall within the remit of the Community, with a European public prosecution office, a public prosecutor and a Community Europol.
The European Parliament must be granted full legislative and budgetary powers.
The President of the European Commission must be elected by the European Parliament and the European Council of Ministers must meet in public when they discuss legal matters.
I am pleased that Mr Prodi has said this now, and I am very interested to see if Mr Michel shares this view.
These are the topics which mainly centre around transparency and the Union' s democratic content and which, as far as I am concerned, should be added to the Convention' s agenda, thus affording the Union a more stable foundation which meets the requirements of a modern constitutional state when the new Member States accede.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my opinion, the most important aspect of the Laeken Summit is the following: that the Council is able to reverse the trend seen in Nice, that is to say, that we move away from this feeling of failure at the summit that marked the end of the French Presidency a year or so ago, towards a feeling of success at the Laeken summit at political level and for Europe' s citizens.
I think that this is what the excellent Leinen and Méndez de Vigo report is calling for.
In addition to the details, the concrete proposals, which are, of course, important, the essential thing is to develop a new perspective at Laeken, a constitutional perspective, and this means, without any doubt and as I said before, reversing the current trend.
The method for the forthcoming reform is of fundamental importance.
As is the Convention.
But neither must we let the Convention develop into some kind of tedious rigmarole, and in order for this not to be the case, the Convention should be called in order to prepare reform with true content and a real agenda.
If the agenda for the forthcoming reform remains restricted to Declaration 23 annexed to the Treaty of Nice, we will not be getting off to the right start, and the report that this House will, probably, approve tomorrow, calls for more than this.
It calls for a more wide-ranging agenda.
Above all, it calls for an agenda that, once again, includes the policies of the Union and the institutions that are intended to manage these policies.
It also calls for the Union to have its own legal personality.
It is for this agenda, and so as not to distract public opinion, that the Convention has to be called.
The Convention needs an agenda, but it also needs a mandate, a membership, a working method and a timetable to make it worthwhile.
I would like to highlight the words of Mr Méndez de Vigo: it would be incredible to keep the same number of representatives of the European Parliament as in the Convention that had the task of drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights, when the total number of participants in the next Convention will increase significantly.
This imbalance would, of course, be unacceptable.
Secondly, the Convention should work not on the basis of unanimity, but on the basis of majority consensus.
I think that this is the exact definition.
It should have the right to decide who to choose as President and the right to finish its work on time.
This is important in order to ensure that the conclusions of the Convention are not put on ice, because although time, heals all, it also makes us forget.
This is the commitment that we ask of Laeken: an ambitious reform with a different method of achieving more Europe and a better Europe.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I initially wanted to respond to the points made by each speaker, but unfortunately, I do not think that I will have time to go into details.
I shall, however, try to answer as accurately as I can.
First of all, I would like to give my very sincere thanks to the European Parliament and to the majority of the speakers for the quality of their comments, and for the overwhelming European voluntarism that I have heard in this House.
I must say that I do not always hear the same voluntarism in the other European institutions where I work.
I have therefore found a great deal of optimism here, which I was not expecting.
The ambitious goals that you are setting for European integration are very much in line with the ideas and the ambitions that I share, that we share.
So, with only a few days to go before Laeken, it is most certainly a welcome commitment, one that I heard voiced by almost all Members.
One of the speakers said that the Laeken Summit would be a difficult exercise.
I am sure that it will be, because the EU candidate countries, particularly during the debate on the future of Europe, will be faced with a number of choices which are virtually breaking points, and which are so important for the future of Europe that some of us will just have to demonstrate a virtue that is extremely difficult in politics, in other words, that of the ability to make sacrifices.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to focus briefly on the Convention, and I would first of all like to explain to you what the Convention is not.
I may thus be able to reassure those of you who already see a thousand and one reasons in the Convention for sacrificing some things that they have always believed in, and which are, in fact, crippling Europe.
The Convention is not and no one has ever thought that it was the Intergovernmental Conference.
The Convention cannot, and I think that it was Mr Méndez de Vigo who said this, act as an alibi either.
To my mind, it should, first and foremost, be a worthwhile sounding board.
I could also put that another way.
It can also be a challenge upon the political responsibility of the IGC members, who will have to take up this challenge, because the Convention will, at any rate, make all Council members face their political responsibility.
Let us imagine, for example, that the Convention is proposing three or four options on a specific subject related to an issue that is fundamental for the future of Europe. One of these options receives unanimous support or consensus, another receives the support of 80% of Members, and the third is given 50-50.
We are well aware that the Intergovernmental Conference is not going to be forced to choose between these options and that it could very well decide to choose another option, to come up with something else, to give these options a different response to the one that the Convention would have given.
In this case, all IGC members, when shouldering their responsibilities, when adopting one option or another, or when selecting from the options which are presented by the Convention, will, at the same time, risk being at odds, not only with the Convention, but with civil society which must, at some point, make known its intentions, its expectations and its aspirations for this Convention.
Therefore, do not underestimate the Convention due to the fact that it is not a decision-making body; do not underestimate its political weight or its political force.
I make no secret of the fact that I have several reservations as to the composition, even though I do not believe that we should no longer consider the request to increase the number of MEPs.
I think that this is quite a legitimate question, even if I must reiterate that, in our proposal, we took up the proportions that were used in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The difference compared to the Charter is that we agreed the candidate countries would take part.
We must take this difference into account.
I shall reiterate that, at the Ghent European Council, we received requests that ran counter to the requests made by the European Parliament.
Several countries demanded an increase in the number of members from the national parliaments, perhaps so that the ruling coalition could have better representation, perhaps to take into account sub-national entities or perhaps because of the bi-cameral system.
Essentially, it is quality, rather than quantity, that counts, and I think that the MEPs will always have an advantage because of the fact that they are in control of this dossier and of procedures.
I would still like to add a brief comment regarding the composition, namely that it would be regrettable if latent rivalries between political groups or specific components rise to the surface.
I think that the debate must be open; we must not consider ourselves according to the grouping to which we belong.
I think we must consider ourselves on our intellectual strength, our intellectual objectivity, on our intellectual, philosophical, cultural and political freedom of thought.
This must be done in an objective manner and I am sure that we are all capable of doing this.
Therefore, as far as I am concerned, I am willing to see whether an increase in the European Parliament' s representation will cause too many difficulties, such as, for example, too many Members taking part in the Convention, and whether we will encounter similar requests.
This could mean that the number of representatives might prevent the Convention from working smoothly.
In my opening remarks, I gave my thoughts on the outcome of the Convention and how worthwhile it is.
I think that our work is moving in the direction proposed by Parliament.
We use the consensus method where possible, and have the possibility, where necessary, of presenting options in preferential order, for example.
However, we must avoid imposing the consensus method from the outset, because I think that this would weaken the Convention, which would then only be adopted by the smallest common denominator.
The possibility for the Convention to present various options must enable us to hold a debate with conflicting views.
I would like to go over the various questions that were put to me concerning enlargement.
I would like to respond to the speakers who are not sceptical, but who are obviously concerned.
Everyone says that they are in favour of enlargement; everyone says that it is an important political and historical step.
At the same time, however, a number of people seem to put forward arguments as if they have not heard what has been said, to express their reservations over enlargement.
I would like to make something clear.
We have always said that we would, first of all, try to keep up the pace of negotiations with the exceptionally rapid pace set by the Swedish Presidency, and that, secondly, we would do this by judging every country on its own merits.
The fact that we can today give a particularly positive progress report on the negotiations does not mean, of course, as some speakers have suggested, that we are being almost politically negligent and would be willing to accept 10 countries before 2004 without any further verification, further judgment or criteria.
Of course we would not, and therefore we continue to say, with regard to enlargement, that yes, it is irreversible, but also, yes, each country must be judged on its own merits.
These are my comments on enlargement.
I think that Mr Barón Crespo mentioned the presidium and wanted the forthcoming presidencies to be a part of that.
I am not against this at all, but we must keep a sense of balance.
A compromise might be for the next presidencies to take part as observers.
The Convention can take up any issue, including European security and defence policy.
As we know, these are the four themes from Nice relating to the Convention.
However, as soon as you say that the Convention was not an Intergovernmental Conference, and was not going to take certain decisions, and I do not really understand why, some people appear to want to limit the scope of the Nice themes at all costs.
If, having considered every aspect of the themes from Nice, other issues are tackled, it would be quite worrying for an exercise, which will widely involve civil society in the debate, to say 'you are going to be restricted to very specific topics and you can only discuss the issues that we want you to discuss.
That is a bit mean.
Instead, we are in favour of a more optimistic view, where the four themes from Nice are more widely interpreted.
I hope that I can count on the European Parliament, at least the more optimistic of its Members, to help us to convince others of this point of view and of this direction.
With regard to Mr Cox' s comments, I share the point of view that Mr Poettering also expressed, that the Commission must remain at the centre of the Community system.
The question of timing is also important.
There are a number of constraints and there are many elections.
I believe that the time period between the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference must be six months.
If it is any longer, I feel that we will be in danger of undoing all the good work of the Convention and the debates, and the worst scenario would be for everyone to arrive at the IGC having forgotten the options in the meantime, or for some to have had the time to pretend they have forgotten them, or having completely stripped the options of all substance.
Thus, all the worthwhile work of the Convention will also have been for nothing.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is largely what I wanted to say.
I have almost certainly forgotten to say something, but it is time now to answer the last speaker, who asked me if I was in favour of transparency in the Council' s work.
Of course, I am in favour of transparency in the Council' s work.
Unfortunately, I have many more reservations about carrying out a public relations exercise that would weaken the quality of debate within the Council.
Mrs Maij-Weggen, I am a seasoned parliamentarian, having spent more than 20 years in Parliament.
I was also head of opposition in my country for a long time, too long for my liking.
Even in Parliament, if we really want to take the general interests of our citizens into account on specific subjects and specific dossiers, it is sometimes better to hold the debate behind closed doors, and not only when naming names or individuals.
I think that it would be unwise to turn essential debates on extremely delicate issues into media fodder, debates where 15 Heads of State or Government are trying to reach agreement.
I am not totally against holding public debates on a number of issues, but if all the Council formations had to be organised and carried out publicly, I am not sure that that would yield the results that you want, and that I want as well.
Therefore, I say yes to transparency, but I have much greater reservations as to propaganda.
There were two suggestions as to how to involve civil society in the work of this Convention.
The first suggestion was to create a second forum, a second institution and a second assembly.
The major difficulty in doing this is to determine how to select the members of this second assembly, which would bear the huge responsibility of representing European civil society as a whole.
It is extremely difficult to select who is the best spokesperson for a specific subject.
We would have therefore created a competing institution, existing beside the Convention, made up of representatives of the institutions.
This was one choice, this was the first suggestion.
The second suggestion that we considered was to work with what I will call a structured network whose origins are found in civil society.
We must ensure that this structured network is not at all limiting, ensure that all those involved, all those representing one aspect of public opinion can submit their thoughts, their expectations, their criticisms, their proposals to the Convention, and that the Convention can, if necessary, call upon them to interview them.
In other words, this approach is a dynamic exchange of views between the Convention and everyone in European society, be it the academic world, schools, NGOs, or associations.
It is important to give everyone the channels through which they can express their views.
We have chosen a structured network, on the understanding that everything produced will be included in the Convention' s official documentation, and that all those who contact the Convention will receive an answer, not just an acknowledgement.
I think that the most representative forces of our society will emerge in time.
I am clarifying this so that there are no misunderstandings.
Thank you, Mr Michel.
It is gratifying to hear that you are convinced of the good will of this Parliament, but you will understand that we, and hence the European citizens, also stand to win or lose the most from the success of this Convention.
I will now give the floor to Commissioner Barnier.
Madam President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission I too would like to thank you for the weight and quality of the speeches you have made throughout this debate on the two major subjects on the agenda: governance and Laeken.
Please excuse President Prodi, who had to leave us a few moments ago for an essential engagement with the Economic and Social Committee.
With regard to governance, allow me to highlight the very first words of Mrs Kaufmann, who, like Mr Prodi, I would like to thank most sincerely for her availability and for the quality of the work that she has done on your behalf on this both important and difficult subject.
You put it very well, Mrs Kaufmann: the debate on governance is part of the great debate on the future of the Union.
It is not only our reason for being, our raison d' être, that is in question, and I will come back to that in a moment, it is also our way of being, our way of acting.
The Commission, particularly in the White Paper on governance, is going to promote the co-legislation function of the European Parliament.
Through this White Paper, we are offering Parliament the opportunity to be in a better situation to exert its prerogatives, including better checking of the quality of the choice of legislative instruments, better monitoring of the quality of the use of expertise - is it pluralist? - and the quality of the use of consultation - is it fair?
To be quite frank, there remains a point of debate between us which Mr Swoboda stressed in his speech just now, you pointed it out: we are not convinced of the benefits of a mechanism that would allow legislative acts to be suspended at any time, this famous call-back mechanism, when the Commission' s responsibility in the current comitological framework is not itself certain.
We proposed looking, together with Parliament and the Council, at other mechanisms that will allow, the European Parliament to exert its responsibility for monitoring in a proportional, that is to say, a balanced manner in the matters currently covered by codecision.
However, ladies and gentlemen, beyond that point of debate on which we need to do more work together, I would like to say that we consider the debate that you have just had on the whole subject of governance to be the means of forging ahead after today' s sitting.
I would also like to say a few words about the Laeken Summit, on which we, like President Prodi, have worked very hard.
We still have a great deal of work to do on Laeken and on the situation post-Laeken.
But I, too, must praise the quality of the work of your two rapporteurs, Mrs Leinen and Mr Méndez de Vigo, as I have already done before the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
One of you, with their usual frankness, had very harsh words to say about the Commission, which is at the heart of the Community model and method, and which intends to remain at the heart with the threefold role of proposing, monitoring and implementing which was conferred on it by the Treaties. With the reunification of the European continent, as the disparities increase and the centrifugal forces become more numerous, that role of the Commission, at the heart of the Community model, is going to become even more necessary than it has been in the past 50 years.
Mr Voggenhuber accused the Commission of having no vision.
I do not think that he is here to listen to my reply, but I am nevertheless going to give it.
Everyone is free to interpret the word 'vision' as they choose.
Personally, I tend rather to practise the pessimism of reason and the optimism of will, and the reason I quote this fine phrase from Jean Monnet is just to echo what Mr Michel was saying just now, as he confessed that, in a way, he had come here to find some optimism therapy that was not forthcoming elsewhere.
So I just wanted to refer you to that fine phrase from Jean Monnet.
With regard to political will, which has been a common feature of many of your speeches, President Prodi announced four strategic objectives in this House.
We want to pursue them, and he will have the opportunity in his State-of-the-Union speech to the plenary on 11 December to prove that he is serious about them.
What would Parliament have said if, even before the start of the Convention for which we fought together, the Commission had produced its final vision of our Constitutional Treaty or of our Constitution, ignoring or pre-empting the democratic debate that is going to take place, for the first time, on such broad subjects.
I am well aware of this, and I say so under the supervision of my colleague and friend, Mr Vitorino, who worked a great deal with you on the previous Convention on fundamental rights: here we are dealing with subjects that are more politically open and probably more problematic.
The debate needs to take place.
We are going to take part in it but there was no question of us pre-empting it or acting as though it did not count.
Let us not underestimate the approach of governance and the White Paper. The intensity of your debate, today, proves that they are not trivial matters.
Before concluding, as I promised to be brief on the issue of the Laeken Convention and especially on the situation post-Laeken, on behalf of the Commission I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Michel, in particular, for the political will and courage that they have shown and which they are going to have to show in the few remaining days before Laeken in order to convince the Member States that the draft declaration on which they have worked and which they are proposing to the Member States will be well respected and not diminished.
I, too, heard Mr Michel using familiar words just now.
I feel that, taking into account the Convention and the fact this is the first occasion on which an institutional debate has had to allow time to accommodate the work of a Convention, we do have enough time: two years, and we have an open method which, as it concerns a reform of the Treaty on the institutions themselves, consists of more than just dialogue between the government ministers in the secrecy and comfort of the intergovernmental method alone, of which we have all seen the limitations, both at Amsterdam and at Nice.
Let us use this opportunity and make this Convention serve its purpose as a tool for projecting ideas upwards, to the institutions, to the governments who will ultimately have to decide, and to the people that you represent.
This Convention, let us say it again so that it is clear, will not take any decision.
And once that point has been made quite clear, we need to agree, and I was very pleased to hear Mr Michel' s words on this point, not to be overcautious or too closed in our reading of the four Nice points.
On the contrary, we need to look at them openly and constructively, to take the four points together and deal with them ambitiously.
It is clear that this leads to a Constitutional process.
Let us not be afraid of words.
And let us be ambitious as we look at these four points, particularly the point on the use of powers, good tools for exercising current powers and the clarification of competences, which, of course, leads us to ask questions about the European plan.
What do we want to do together?
Do we want to stay where we are?
Do some want to go backwards and unravel the acquis communautaire?
Do we want to go further in integration, in the general interest of the citizens, on the third pillar, on foreign policy, on defence?
These are the demands and requests from the people.
If we want to go further, do we want to go all together or do just a few of us want to go?
And how?
All these questions are both central to and pervade the matter, together with the four points, and the Convention, which will not take any decision but needs to make strong proposals, will have a lot of work to do.
This is what I wanted to say and, finally, I, too, think that those of us who are going to take part in this convention need to be open and to listen to what is said outside the debating chamber during that time.
Among the citizens, in each of our countries, in each of our regions, and I am very aware of the forum that the regional framework provides for public debate, for debate among the people, where many useful things can be said and passed on.
We should be open to the debate that will take place during that time in civil society.
The Commission will not be a spectator throughout that period.
It will have its special place within this Convention, as it will subsequently take part in the Intergovernmental Conference and as the President of the Commission will ultimately take an active part in the European Council of the very last Intergovernmental Conference, scheduled to take place at the latest at the beginning of 2004, before the European elections.
Next week, we are going to decide on a communication, on which I am working with President Prodi, on Laeken, on the situation before Laeken and on the likely scenario after the Laeken decisions have been implemented.
Trust us, trust me; the Commission will make regular proposals and will put forward contributions and communications on each of the subjects.
I have heard a group Chairman requesting this.
I can assure you, Chairman Poettering, Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Cox, that, not only, Mr Barón Crespo, on the issues of simplification or competences but on all the other subjects as well, although first of all on the issue of competences, which directly concerns us, the Commission will put contributions and suggestions on the Convention table in order to express a vision.
However, I must make it quite clear that that vision, and we will confirm this next week in our communication, will, in all probability, be the preservation of the model of the community method and also, once its preservation is assured, its reinvigoration and legitimisation.
Thank you, Commissioner Barnier.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Procedural motions (continued)
On 15 November, I brought to your attention the plight of the plane spotters arrested in Greece, amongst them my constituents Lesley and Paul Coppin.
That was two weeks ago and they are still in jail.
Last week I visited Mrs Coppin and she is very distressed.
It may be that some of those arrested have been over enthusiastic in their activities and, technically, may have appeared to have broken Greek law but others in the group, including Mrs Coppin, have done absolutely nothing wrong.
There is no evidence against them and no foundation for holding them.
These people have therefore been held in custody for almost three weeks on no justifiable basis.
Neither they nor their lawyer were present when evidence was originally presented to the investigating judge who took his arbitrary decisions in camera.
For much of the time Mrs Coppin and the other detainees had no idea of the nature of the charges against them or how long they were likely to be kept in prison before their case was dealt with.
This is disgraceful by any standards and a flagrant abuse of their civil and human rights.
Provisions under Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, along with case-law, make clear that persons arrested within the European Union must be brought promptly - and that means within seven days - before a judge who must free them immediately if no foundation for their detention exists.
It must have been clear to the judge, by 16 November at the latest, that there was no evidence against many of the individuals and they should therefore have been released immediately.
What we are now seeing is a charade of justice.
I ask you, Madam President, and the President of the Council and the Commission President, to take immediate action with the Greek authorities to secure the urgent release of all the detainees from custody, particularly Mrs Coppin.
This cannot be allowed to go on for another day.
Thank you.
The President has already taken this matter up with the Permanent Representation of Greece via her Cabinet.
She has also declared herself prepared to take steps personally if this situation persists.
I now give the floor to Baroness Ludford.
Early this afternoon the President felt she needed to cut short and postpone the opportunity for Members to raise this matter.
She felt she had to prioritise the debate on the future of Europe.
But the future of Europe will be nothing if our people do not support us.
This case is a perfect example of the impact on individuals of the quality or otherwise of European integration.
Parliament had a chance to show its relevance to people and missed it in prime time.
Our motion now clashes with the Presidential debate where most of our colleagues are.
I find it difficult to believe that after nearly three weeks it has been impossible to clarify, let alone hear, the charges against the 12 Britons.
I am also puzzled about the role the Greek air force has reportedly had in reviewing the charges as opposed to an independent prosecutor.
The defendants have not had an opportunity to challenge the evidence in open court and now the higher tribunal to which the case has been referred is to be held in secret.
Mr Souladakis said earlier that the Greek criminal justice authorities had respected all relevant rights.
I am surprised that the European Convention on Human Rights is so weak.
We might need a Europe-wide review with a view to reinforcing those standards and we certainly need that in parallel with the European arrest warrant.
I call on the Greek authorities to clarify the charges, release the defendants on bail and hold a trial in open court by Friday of this week.
I would just like to underline that this is an issue that has the support of all parties in my own country.
It concerns not just British citizens but also Dutch citizens.
It has massive public interest and raises questions at a time when we are proceeding in the field of Justice and Home Affairs at European level on the basis of mutual recognition.
That implies that we need to be confident that every country's legal system is up to scratch and meets the minimum standards set down in the European Convention on Human Rights.
It is important and I am glad you have announced that the President will take this up.
Thank you, Mr Corbett.
The points made by all speakers are absolutely clear.
I have already told Mr Van Orden that the issue is being monitored by the President' s Cabinet, that action has already been undertaken and that, if necessary, the President will personally see to this matter if the situation persists.
Following on from the points of order made earlier today, I am grateful the President is going to raise the issue yet again with the Greek authorities.
I am speaking particularly about my constituent Wayne Groves from Tamworth.
He did not even possess a camera so I still do not know why he is being held in detention.
He is sleeping on a floor with a thin mattress, as I understand are the other prisoners.
He has been there for three weeks.
Why, when the magistrate said yesterday that there was no real evidence against them, are they still being held?
I believe along with everybody else that this is in contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights.
If applicant countries have to say that will adhere to it before membership, surely current members should adhere to it now.
I should like to raise the same issue without, however, repeating what has already been said on the matter.
Two lads from my constituency are also still in captivity in Greece on account of the same crime: this is evidently the seriousness with which this matter is being dealt with in Greece.
I would point out that the next item on the agenda is the European arrest warrant.
In relation to what is currently happening in Greece, that is a topic which we, as well as the Council, will have to treat with extreme caution to prevent the situation from causing European distortion in the field of criminal law policy.
Thank you, I have already responded to this point.
Madam President, as we are talking about human rights, I would like to speak on an issue of method, which applies to all the association agreements.
Today, a joint debate is going to take place on the association agreements with Egypt, and it will include oral questions and motions for resolutions.
For the sake of a democratic debate and a more coherent vote on all the association agreements, it is important for it to be split into separate parts.
We suggest that the debate should deal, first of all, with oral questions and resolutions and then, secondly, with the vote on the association agreements.
It is neither logical nor coherent to take a position on these issues at the same time.
The oral questions and resolutions are intended to question the political powers of these countries and to give them time to debate and respond to those questions.
This two-part method allows us to confirm the fundamental importance that we attach to the whole agreement, particularly Article 2 on human rights.
The example of Egypt is telling in that it shows that we do not silently accept a decision that constitutes a violation of human rights, the recent condemnation of homosexuals, and flouts the values that we defend in Article 2 of our agreements.
Our group would therefore like to keep the debate and vote on oral questions and motions for resolutions in one part-session, and put the association agreements back to another part-session.
We have already made a request to that effect by letter to the President.
This point will be dealt with in this evening' s debate.
Mr President, you may not, but Mrs Fontaine certainly will be aware of the following matter which we have raised in the European Parliament, time and again, over the last ten years.
It concerns three Greek seamen from the lower ranks of the crew of a Greek ship who were arrested in Egypt, found responsible for the 7.5 tonnes of drugs on board the ship and handed down very heavy sentences.
To give the Egyptian courts their due, it was not the owners per se or the master of the ship who were responsible, it was the three unfortunate lower-ranking members of the crew.
Mrs Fontaine and all her predecessors have already expressed their support and asked for them to be released and sent to Greece.
Two and a half years ago, one of the three prisoners died as a result of their appalling conditions of detention.
A few days ago, a second man died of tonsillitis of all things.
The third man is still alive but his health is shot to pieces.
The Bureau should call for his release before he, too, gives up the ghost.
Combating terrorism/EUROJUST
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
Report by Mr Watson (A5-0397/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Commission proposal for a Council framework decision on combating terrorism (COM(2001) 521 - C5-0452/2001 - 2001/0217(CNS)) and the Commission proposal for a Council framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between the Member States (COM(2001) 522 - C5-0453/2001 - 2001/0215(CNS)), and the;
report by Mrs Gebhardt (A5-0398/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council decision setting up Eurojust with a view to reinforcing the fight against major organised crime.
Madam President, it is a matter of regret and perhaps even of shame that it took the events of 11 September to push European governments into tackling effectively a problem which has plagued our continent for over a generation.
In 1997 in Amsterdam, and again in 1999 in Tampere in Finland, the Heads of State and Government committed themselves to tackling terrorism.
Our review of progress early this year showed that they had done nothing about it, which was why we as a Parliament brought forward a report calling on them to take action.
The events of 11 September have fortunately brought such action and I look forward to travelling to Washington shortly to talk about common action between the European Union and the United States of America.
I would like to thank the political groups in this House for their cooperation in drawing up this report, particularly the Members from Spain.
In my report, I broadly welcome the Commission proposals for a Council framework decision on combating terrorism and for a European arrest warrant.
The amendments which I put forward seek to restrict the list of crimes defined as terrorist crimes and covered by the European arrest warrant to the most serious cross-border criminal offences, and if I may quote Amendment No 16, it specifies those crimes "which aim to destroy the fundamental freedoms, democracy, respect for human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law on which our societies are based".
We seek too to insert safeguards for civil liberties by basing action clearly on international human rights documents, by reinforcing the principle of ne bis in idem, by taking account of time spent in detention awaiting trial and by allowing Member States refusal to extradite when there are manifestly sound reasons for doing so, including in those cases where a person found guilty could face a penalty of death.
Moreover, we seek to provide aids to victims of terrorism and their families.
I shall ask the House to accept one amendment, which was submitted after the deadline and which takes account of the most recent developments in Council.
One Member State is threatening to block progress towards a European arrest warrant.
There is a method - not one which I recommend - but one which may be needed in extremis, in order to press ahead, and that is to invoke Article 40 of the Treaty allowing reinforced cooperation between a certain number of Member States.
Terrorism is a supranational challenge and calls for a supranational response.
We cannot allow the blockage of one Member State to prevent common action in fighting it.
When we met in this Chamber, on 12 September, we had a debate in which I remember Mr Poettering and many others said that we were all Americans.
Since then, we have discovered that we must first be Europeans.
We acknowledge that recognition of judicial judgements and judicial standards requires trust in each other's systems, but not blind trust, and for that reason I have put forward an amendment calling for urgent measures to improve judicial systems in our Member States, to encourage benchmarking, to encourage exchange of best practice.
The process of creating an area of freedom, security and justice is similar to that of creating the single market, but it is more urgent and, moreover, we are dealing not with the freedom of movement of goods, services or capital, but with the freedom of people.
The Greens and other political groups are saying, don't go ahead until you are sure that everybody's judicial standards are perfect.
Majority opinion, however, on the Committee recognises that the scope of the challenge we face and the historical imperative are such that we must press ahead with these measures with prudence, and with vigilance, but also with determination.
We must ensure effective action against terrorists and yet we must not deny legitimate political expression of grievances.
I was surprised to read in El País this morning an interpretation of one amendment, which I support, that it would outlaw Herri Batasuna.
I do not interpret the amendment in this way, nor would such an amendment be necessary to target those involved in supporting terrorist acts.
Other provisions in what we are proposing do that.
I would say to colleagues, and particularly to our Spanish colleagues, that in our determination to tackle terrorism, we must acknowledge that terrorists sometimes express political grievances, and that these require a political response.
Council is discussing the proposals put forward by the Commission; Parliament, which desperately needs powers of codecision, may be reconsulted on this matter.
We are determined to assist governments in their work and yet maintain the delicate balance between the security needs of our citizens and preservation of their democratic freedoms.
In this, cooperation in Justice and Home Affairs has received quite a boost.
Whatever it was that we planned at Amsterdam, the paradox is that events are what drives Europe forward: just as Mr Haider's election led us to adopt effective legislation against racism and xenophobia, so it may be that Mr bin Laden has done much for European Union integration.
May I say, finally, what a pleasure it is to see you as a fellow Liberal Democrat in the Chair in this session.
I wish you a successful debate.
, rapporteur.
(DE) Madam President, Madam Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the improvement of judicial cooperation between the European Union's Member States is an important key to the European area of freedom, security and justice.
The establishment, at long last, of Eurojust puts this key in our hands, so that we can combat serious crime, such as terrorism, trafficking in human beings and drug-smuggling flexibly and successfully, without regard to the Community's internal borders.
When Parliament approved the establishment of Eurojust, as long ago as early 2001, it envisaged 1 January 2002 as its starting date.
The Council has made substantial changes to the initiatives underlying Eurojust, which made it necessary to consult Parliament again, but, despite this, I do not see Eurojust's starting date early next year as having been jeopardised.
The Council has, since 11 September, demonstrated its capacity for rapid reaction when circumstances require it, as the safety of people in Europe most certainly does.
The document under consideration today already incorporates significant amendments by the Council at Parliament's suggestion in the first consultation.
Eurojust's areas of competence were therefore defined in such a way as to include borderline cases and new forms of serious crime.
Eurojust can also, moreover, at the request of a competent national authority, support investigations and prosecutions outside the areas described.
This ensures maximum flexibility and efficiency in our shared struggle against crime, which knows no boundaries.
Parliament's proposals for smooth cooperation between Eurojust and the national authorities are also welcomed in the Council's new document, something for which I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude.
Despite this, we still have to make a few changes in order to make Eurojust the best possible instrument against cross-frontier crime.
If I rightly understand the indications from the Member States' governments and from the Council, these will meet with wide-ranging agreement between Parliament and the Council.
Last weekend, the German and French governments, at their summit in Nantes, underlined Parliament's view that Eurojust should become the basic unit of a European State Prosecution Service.
This would strengthen the European Union's judicial aspect, give effect to conventions that have been drawn up but not yet ratified, and continue existing initiatives in this area.
I also consider it important that Eurojust's involvement in investigations and prosecutions should not be hampered by unnecessary bureaucracy.
It makes no sense for Eurojust to set up national branch offices.
Investigators and prosecutors, in Eurojust and in the Member States, must be able to communicate with each other directly.
We know from our experience of organised crime that short routes and procedures alone can offer hope of speedy and sure success in investigations.
Let me conclude with data protection, a point which is of especial importance to me.
The processing of data by Eurojust must include an appropriately high level of protection for the individual citizen.
This can only be taken for granted if the storing of personal data is kept to the minimum required and if data is not stored for longer than is absolutely necessary.
It goes without saying that special requirements must apply to the handling of data on victims and witnesses.
There is also a clear need to safeguard the individual's right to information, which he must be in a position to demand.
It is most encouraging to receive favourable indications from the Council, including in data protection matters.
I hope, though, that they will go much further yet.
Only one wish will no doubt not be granted me: Eurojust will not be based in Luxembourg, which would have symbolised so well this institution's independence and its closeness to European Community law.
Madam President, I have indeed the honour of representing the Presidency here, because, unfortunately, the Minister of Justice is unable to attend today.
I have been asked to discuss this topic on his behalf, which I naturally do with great pleasure.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would, first of all, like to start by thanking you for the speed and flexibility with which you have worked over recent weeks.
The Council meeting of 20 September, and then the European Council that met the following day, decided, as you know, on rapid implementation of the Action Plan against terrorism, with a December deadline for each of the three decisions that we are discussing today, which are key elements of this action plan.
European citizens would not understand if the European Union did not work as fast as possible to adopt the measures in question.
The speed with which the rapporteurs have worked and with which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has examined the reports, and you are to discuss them today, are exemplary.
Respecting the deadlines set for adopting these decisions depended on all of that, and the Presidency is very grateful to you for that support for its work.
Madam President, first of all, I will deal with the decision creating Eurojust, then the framework decision on the European arrest warrant, and I will finish with the framework decision on combating terrorism.
I will not go back over the objectives of each of the instruments, or not much.
You know them well enough.
I would like to confine myself to the reason why you invited the Presidency here today, and I will therefore go through the preparatory work for each of the decisions.
(NL) With regard to Eurojust, the setting up of a permanent unit was one of our absolute priorities in the field of justice.
The terrorist threat has only reinforced this intention.
We are doing everything we can to ensure that this instrument is adopted in December so that we can meet the objectives of Tampere.
I am delighted to be able to inform you that everything seems to suggest that the Council will be able meet this deadline.
Admittedly, a political agreement had already been struck during the Council meeting of 27 and 28 September on Articles 1 to 8 of this Decision.
You are aware of the fact that these articles constitute the actual core of this Decree establishing Eurojust.
Under the Belgian Presidency, the working party has spent 13 meeting days on this instrument.
The entire text has already been the subject of overall reading in the working party. It has also been examined by the Article 36 Committee and is now before the COREPER.
(FR) An initial opinion from Parliament was adopted on 17 May this year but, given the many changes that had been made to the text, it became necessary to have a fresh consultation.
The Presidency has taken particular care to ensure that the opinions given by Parliament were taken into account throughout the negotiations.
Eurojust should bring real added value compared with the existing instruments.
Bringing together magistrates from the Member States in a single body will surely enable good coordination and close cooperation between the authorities responsible for prosecution.
Eurojust will thus provide an effective instrument with a view to creating the area of freedom, security and justice which has been our aim since the Treaty of Amsterdam.
To this end, we therefore needed to ensure genuine, effective cooperation between Eurojust and the other bodies created as part of our Union.
We therefore needed to be careful to avoid overlaps of responsibility and redundancies.
All these issues are covered by provisions in the draft decision.
Cooperation between Eurojust and Europol and the relationship that those two bodies will have to maintain will be the subject of a separate agreement.
This draft agreement is being drawn up by the members of the pro-Eurojust provisional unit and the representatives of Europol.
It was most desirable to include those primarily affected in the discussion and to better integrate the further developments in Europol that are currently under negotiation within the European Union.
(NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in line with your wishes, Eurojust' s areas of competence have been set up in such a way as to afford Eurojust the scope needed to deal with borderline cases and new forms of crime.
Eurojust will take part in the coordination of the competent authorities of the Member States and could ask these to set up joint research teams.
The authorities of Member States which fail to meet Eurojust' s request will need to justify their actions.
A whole host of provisions in the draft Decree concern the introduction of rules to protect personal data.
After all, it was, and is, vital, on the one hand, to provide Eurojust with the possibility of dealing with such data, but, on the other hand, to offer every guarantee that privacy is protected.
The expertise gathered by the interim unit which was set up on 1 March of this year was taken into consideration.
Representatives of this unit took part in the working party and were given the opportunity of sharing their findings during those activities.
I should like to underline the fact that the activities carried out by the interim unit have more than adequately attested to the significance and value of a unit such as Eurojust, particularly over the past few weeks.
Hopefully, you will be pleased to hear that, according to the latest state of activities, it will very much be the task of your Parliament to grant Eurojust discharge for the implementation of the budget.
Despite this, a few important questions remain unanswered, although they are limited in number.
They mainly concern the modalities with regard to the right to perusal of personal data, the entry into force of the Decree and the statute of Eurojust staff.
(FR) Finally, the issue of the headquarters remains open.
It should be possible to make a decision on this at the Laeken Summit.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will finish this part of my statement by drawing your attention to the fact that, on 16 November, the Presidency insisted that the Member States prepare from now on to implement the framework decision creating Eurojust, so that it can be wholly operational as soon as possible.
Allow me to move on to the work regarding the European arrest warrant.
As you know, the Commission' s proposal is based on the principle of mutual recognition of final decisions.
That means that each national authority must recognise ipso facto, with minimal checks, a request to hand over a person made by the judicial authority of another Member State.
The European arrest warrant is meant to replace the current extradition mechanism for the crimes that it covers.
(NL) The framework decision on this arrest warrant is technically a very complex instrument, because it deals with important issues within criminal law procedure, but also with issues which, for example, pertain to the description of people which facilitates the tracing of them.
Given the extent of the tasks and the deadlines to be met, the Presidency has speeded up the Council activities considerably.
The dossier was immediately dealt with by the Article 36 Committee, thus allowing the most delicate issues to be discussed there straight away.
This has necessitated the convening of various extraordinary meetings.
Furthermore, a group of experts has also met several times in order to prepare the groundwork for the most technical aspects.
At the Article 36 Committee, the debates to date have mainly focused on the scope of the instrument that addresses the problems involved in the dual criminality requirement and on the modalities of judicial inspection within the implementing Member State.
The Member States are agreed that the scope must be determined on the basis of a positive list of infringements.
It was impossible to retain the principle of a negative list because it has appeared impossible to reach agreement about the withdrawal of the dual criminality requirement with such a broadly defined scope.
During the Justice and Internal Affairs Council of 16 November, there was broad consensus about the Presidency' s compromise proposal for a positive list and also a mock agreement to apply dual criminality to the infringements which feature on the list.
(FR) These offences are those covered by the Treaty on European Union, the Tampere conclusions, the Annex to the Europol Convention and the four offences proposed by the Commission, which are sabotage, arson, crimes against humanity according to the statute of the International Criminal Court, hijacking of aircraft and hijacking of ships.
It includes, among other things, terrorism and in the trafficking of human beings.
In order to reach a unanimous agreement, it will undoubtedly be necessary to alter the list.
The Council agreed to work on the basis of two proposals.
One envisaged that, for the offences on the list that have not yet been harmonised, the double jeopardy rule should only be withdrawn if the offence is considered to be serious in the issuing State.
That would imply a sentence threshold greater than the twelve months currently established for offences which have not been harmonised among the fifteen Member States.
Under the other proposal, removing dual criminality would be limited to offences committed wholly or partially on the territory of the issuing State, the idea being that a handover could not be refused for acts committed on the territory of the State issuing the warrant.
(NL) During the Justice and Internal Affairs Council of 16 November, the ministers managed to reach agreement on the conditions under which an appeal may be made to the rights enjoyed in the implementing State, as well as on the deadline for handing over a suspect.
The basic principles are as follows: the law of the implementing State determines the modalities under which the rights can be called upon.
In the event of the wanted person consenting to their surrender, a period of ten days is stipulated.
In the event of an arrest, a period of sixty days is stipulated and in special cases, these periods can be extended by thirty days.
The other provisions of the Commission proposal were discussed in the Article 36 Committee on 22 and 23 November.
The discussions centred around the reasons for refusing to implement the warrant and the conditions for applying the principle of territoriality and the principle of speciality.
It is too premature at this stage to moot the idea of an agreement, but the activities are very constructive and all provisions have already been discussed in detail.
(FR) Particular attention is paid, and I think, ladies and gentlemen, that this is a concern that you have expressed, to the rights of the requested person: rights to defence, rights regarding the use of languages, rights regarding transfer.
In this respect, it will be stressed that the requested person' s interest in benefiting from a judicial procedure and appearing before the judge as soon as possible should not be neglected.
Another area of obvious improvement on the current extradition procedure is deducting any detention enforced as part of the execution of the European arrest warrant in the executing State from the prison sentence that the person handed receives.
This is the state of the negotiations concerning the framework decision on the European arrest warrant.
As I have said before, there are still difficulties, but we are hopeful that they can be resolved before next week.
(NL) The third instrument, I should like to mention today, is the framework decision on the fight against terrorism.
For that decision, we can, of course, draw on the experience already gathered in connection with the two instruments I mentioned a moment ago, but that does not take away from the importance of the decision.
First of all, because it is also essential to promote judicial cooperation by harmonising penalisations.
It is crucial to develop a common strategy on terrorism and in that way to develop a truly European criminal policy in that area.
It is also vital to grant European courts of justice broad judicial powers.
But the significance of the framework decision also lies in the subtleties thereof, as some of you have rightly pointed out: all actions in connection with terrorism, including taking part in and supporting a terrorist group, must be considered.
At the same time, great care must be taken not to go too far, and accordingly, a definition should be introduced which rules out any risk of abuse.
The Council is acutely aware of this, and it is with those elements in mind that the activities are moving forwards.
They are making steady progress and that is borne out by the outcome of the meetings of 16 November.
Indeed, we can already ascertain that the changes that were made have brought the positions closer together.
(FR) The definition of terrorist offences is almost finalised.
The element of initial intention has been clarified. Added to this are two elements that can also be characteristics of terrorist intent, namely severely intimidating the population or unduly forcing a State to carry out an act.
At the same time, the types of conduct affected have been redefined so that only extremely serious offences are covered, in response to the concerns and criticisms that the initial definition was too broad.
Two additional elements have been adopted by the Council in order to confirm the guarantees of respect for fundamental rights.
First of all, the preamble will state that the framework decision is without prejudice to the exercising of human rights, in particular, the right of association, expression and demonstration.
Also, a political declaration will add to these precautions, specifying that the decision does not cover people who are acting to preserve or restore democratic values, or people who are exercising the right to express their opinions, even if, while exercising that right, they commit offences.
Finally, the preamble will exclude from the framework decision' s scope, the activities of the armed forces in a period of armed conflict when they are performing their official duties, as governed by international law.
This is the situation with regard to the crime of terrorism itself.
(NL) With regard to judicial powers, the Council continues to attach importance to the wide scope of these judicial powers on account of the seriousness of terrorist acts.
A coordination mechanism will be brought about in the event of any conflict of judicial powers among the Member States, which is not inconceivable, given the wide judicial powers of the same States.
Progress continues to be made in the activities in the field of punishment.
The current text provides for the obligation on all Member States to increase penalties for punishable acts of terrorism compared to the same acts without any terrorist intent.
The debates which were held on this topic last Friday in the COREPER were about the very same punishment for punishable acts which are associated with terrorist groups.
Consensus appears to be growing about a maximum penalty of fifteen years for leading a terrorist group and of eight years for taking part in such a group.
If the group has not yet carried out any acts of terrorism, the leading of such a group also incurs an eight year sentence.
However, the debates on this issue have not yet been completed.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that brings to an end the account that I wished to give of the three Council framework decisions that are on your agenda today.
As I have already said, the Presidency expects to see the discussions on these three instruments completed between now and December.
That would certainly be an amazing feat, given the Council' s loaded schedule, but it will, above all, show, on the eve of the Laeken Summit, that the European Union has now achieved a certain maturity in the development of European criminal justice and that it is capable of realising the objectives that it set itself.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I wish to congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on her report on the creation of the Eurojust unit.
The ideas that the Commission expressed on this matter in its communication of November 2000 and the recommendations adopted by the European Parliament in May of this year, following the report by Mrs Gebhardt, are, to a large extent, echoed in the text that is now being studied by the Council.
I shall, therefore, limit myself to emphasising two or three aspects in greater detail.
Firstly, as Mrs Gebhardt stated, in the version currently under examination, the rules on the protection of personal data have been extended and improved.
The draft document adopts a balanced approach that respects both the legitimate interests and fundamental rights of Europe' s citizens and the need for the effective coordination of investigations and prosecutions.
There will be an independent joint supervisory body for data protection and, if necessary, legal solutions will be provided for appeals to be lodged in national courts.
Secondly, the role of the Union' s institutions has been strengthened and the Commission is fully involved in the work of Eurojust in its various areas of responsibility.
Parliament will be kept fully informed of the budgetary issues and I hope that it will also be given the task of discharging the budget.
Mrs Gebhardt' s excellent report also includes a list of supplementary amendments, most of which meet with the Commission' s approval.
I shall only mention the examples of the amendments concerning membership of the joint supervisory body for personal data, cooperation with OLAF, the Commission' s anti-fraud body, and Eurojust, Parliament' s discharge of the budget, the time limits for the storage of data and the law applicable in the event of damage resulting from incorrect data processing.
I hope that the Council will also bear these suggestions in mind.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the other two initiatives under consideration, the events of 11 September 2001 have, I am sad to say, confirmed the validity of the recommendations adopted by the European Parliament on 5 September 2001, following an own-initiative report drawn up by Graham Watson.
As Commissioner responsible for Justice and Home Affairs, I wish to congratulate and pay public tribute to Mr Watson, the Chairman of Parliament' s Committee on Citizen' s Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, whose efforts and name will always be associated with this initiative of enormous political scope; the fight against terrorism and against crime in the European Union.
The recommendations in the Watson report, published in September, were, to a large extent, taken into account in the proposals presented by the Commission on 19 September which are now being studied by the Council.
I wish firstly to discuss the proposal for a framework decision on combating terrorism.
The Council debate on this proposal has focused on the three most important and, at the same time, most problematic issues: defining terrorist crime, clarifying the rules of jurisdiction for the prosecution of terrorist acts and the framework of penalties and sanctions applicable to terrorist acts.
With regard to definition, there has been concern to ensure that the framework decision cannot, under any circumstances, apply to legitimate action, for example in the context of the activities of unions or anti-globalisation movements.
The Commission has subscribed to this interpretation from the outset and considers that the solution we are working towards respects the basic structure of the Commission' s initial proposal, which is to, "define a terrorist offence on the basis of the identification of an objective factor: the terrorist act, accompanied by the identification of a subjective element: a terrorist motivation under the terms of the proposal" .
This is the text currently under consideration by the Council. At the same time, the solution also provides more detail on allowing the requirements that must be met for the offence included in the positive list to be considered a terrorist offence, to be identified in legislation itself.
We are, therefore, in favour of improving the definition contained in the text currently being studied by the Council.
This aspect, in fact, provides a further guarantee: no common crime, not even acts of violence committed incidentally in the context of certain demonstrations, will be covered by the instrument to eliminate terrorism.
The Council is currently considering the possibility of issuing a statement explaining that anyone acting in the interest of preserving or restoring democratic values, instances of which occurred in some Member States during the Second World War, cannot be considered to be a terrorist.
This aspect is in line with some of the amendments tabled by Parliament to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms on which our countries are founded cannot, under any circumstances, be endangered by the present framework decision.
With regard to jurisdiction, the debate in the Council is close to reaching a solution that is very similar to the one recommended in the amendments tabled by the European Parliament.
There is consensus in Council on a balanced formula that combines the Commission' s initial proposal and the more ambitious project suggested by some Member States and by Parliament on national jurisdictions being extended to cover the entire territory of the Union.
Consequently, Member States can, if they so desire, extend their jurisdiction if the offence has been committed in any part of the Union' s territory.
With regard to the third issue, that of penalties and sanctions, I would say that this is still the main problem with the framework decision, given the lack of consensus on a common level of penalties and sanctions for individual terrorist offences.
The Commission is not yet satisfied with the approach that is currently applied for individual offences, under which the penalties and sanctions applicable to terrorist offences committed by individuals would not be harmonised. Instead, weightier penalties and sanctions than those provided for under national legislation for the same offences committed without the special intention required for classification as terrorist acts would apply.
If we limit our ambitions in this way, we will not be fulfilling the mandate laid down in the Article 31(e) of the Treaty, nor will we be following the recommendation contained in the Watson report.
Furthermore, we would be acting inconsistently since, in previous instruments, we have managed to adopt common penalties and sanctions for the counterfeiting of the euro, for assisting illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings, and it would be inexplicable not to be equally ambitious when it comes to punishing terrorist acts.
I hope that it is possible to find a solution on the basis of the proposal that the Commission presented on creating a range of penalties and sanctions for the individual offences listed in Articles 1 and 2 of the Commission proposal, with greater flexibility to adapt them to the scale of penalties in force in the national legislation of each Member State.
Lastly, this framework decision stipulates that the Member States must adopt all possible measures to guarantee appropriate assistance to the families of victims, implementing, where possible, Article 4 of the Framework Decision on the Status of Victims in Connection with Criminal Proceedings.
This approach is entirely consistent with Parliament' s point of view.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the second framework decision, on the European arrest warrant, must be based on the principle of the mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters, in line with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council of October 1999, and with the recommendation made to us by the Heads of State and Government at the Ghent European Council of October this year.
The text we are now discussing, submitted by the Presidency, includes a positive list of offences for which a double jeopardy verification does not have to be carried out.
As you know, the Commission proposal that is being discussed today seeks to make the abolition of the double jeopardy rule universal, with the exception of a negative list identified by the Commission.
Since the Ghent European Council, it has become clear that this approach by the Commission would not have majority support in Council.
Hence the Presidency has moved ahead with a compromise proposal, which assumes that the execution of an arrest warrant for offences included in the positive list does not require double jeopardy verification.
The Commission is prepared to support this compromise proposal by the Presidency provided that the definition of offences included on this positive list is substantial and that it sends a clear, unequivocal message that we are strengthening the mechanisms of judicial cooperation to fight against the various forms of transnational organised crime.
In order to ensure that the mechanism of the positive list works and is effective, the definition of the offences on this list must respect the definition of these offences in force in the legislation of the Member States issuing a search and arrest warrant.
This is an essential component.
Unless this component is complied with, the double jeopardy condition would also be reintroduced for these offences, which is exactly what we are trying to avoid.
I think that we are approaching an agreement on the content of the positive list.
However, at the moment, this agreement is not yet completely signed and sealed.
I hope that, by the Council of 6 and 7 December, it will be possible to conclude a unanimous agreement on a substantial positive list that fulfils the objective of a mechanism for an effective European arrest warrant that can be implemented in a straightforward way.
Regarding the last aspect that I wish to focus on, the Commission has included in its proposal a set of rules that are intended to reconcile effectiveness in the fight against crime, on the one hand, and the protection of citizens' rights and fundamental freedoms on the other.
I hope that the Council resists the temptation to remove provisions that offer protection on the grounds that they are not necessary, since the Member States are, in any event, bound to respect legal safeguards.
It is true that one of the essential elements for the creation of this mechanism is the principle of mutual trust that has resulted from the Member States signing up to the Council of Europe' s European Convention of Human Rights of 1950 and from having jointly proclaimed the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in December of 2000.
I would say, however, that it is, nevertheless, important to emphasise some specific mechanisms that should be included in this framework decision in order to guarantee and safeguard the fundamental rights of our citizens.
Other amendments along the same lines consist of bringing the wording of the Ne bis in idem rule, laid down in Article 29 of the Commission' s proposal, into line with the wording of Article 50 of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights so as to obviate the requirement for the arrest warrant to be accompanied by proof that the individual has been duly informed of the procedure in time to prepare a defence in the event that he or she is sentenced in absentia.
Another good example of these rules is the deduction of the period of deprivation of liberty from the punishment laid down in Article 24 of the Commission proposal, which states that the period of detention in the Member State executing the warrant must be taken into account for the purposes of calculating compensation in the event that the individual surrendered is not convicted.
There must be a balance between the need for speed and effective cooperation between judicial authorities and the interests of individuals, who must not be subjected to additional or excessive constraints or have their ability to mount a defence hampered.
The Commission feels that it would be desirable, where the identification of the laws and principles that safeguard fundamental rights in a European judicial area is concerned, to extend these rules. The Commission realises, therefore, that it would be desirable to pursue the task of approximating legislation on criminal proceedings in the Member States.
We must, simultaneously, guarantee the effectiveness of prosecutions and the safeguarding of the rights of individuals.
It may, therefore, prove necessary at Union level to address, in a more concerted way, the right to language assistance, the proper treatment of evidence and the issue of the courts' bail system.
The Commission is considering the possibility of issuing a communication on these aspects that could cover a huge range of factors.
These issues require a horizontal approach and, therefore, we propose finalising them at a later date in a specific mechanism.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall conclude by referring to Mr Watson' s proposal for an oral amendment that was tabled here today.
Now that we are debating the Commission' s position, we must step up negotiations to conclude an agreement supported by all fifteen Member States.
Not an agreement at any price, but an agreement that responds to the challenge of the fight against terrorism and organised crime before us.
We also welcome the Belgian Presidency' s commitment to obtaining this agreement.
I also wish to make it clear, however, that, where the European arrest warrant is concerned, an agreement can certainly be concluded on the list of thirty-four offences to which Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck has just referred.
I must also clearly state that the list does not include minor offences because this is a list annexed to the Europol Convention.
I would also say that, if these offences are considered to be offences that warrant police cooperation under the terms of Europol, they must also be considered to be unquestionably serious for the purposes of judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
Regardless of national legal cultures and regardless of the moral censure that a particular offence might generate at national level, I am convinced that the option we should pursue at the moment is to conclude an agreement with all fifteen Member States, a substantial agreement on the list of offences to which the European arrest warrant should apply.
If this agreement cannot be concluded with all fifteen countries, we will then have to consider what to do next.
Madam President, I think that today our thoughts should focus on the basics, which are the good fortune and responsibility of living in democratic States governed by the rule of law.
In a democratic State governed by the rule of law, any political demand is acceptable and to be respected and the democratic confrontation of ideas is always to be welcomed; these are our standards, our very essence, our identifying mark, on which the whole idea of European integration is founded.
By the same token, however, the democratic State governed by the rule of law rejects those who express their ideas through bloodshed.
When faced with those who sow the seeds of terror, death and destruction in our societies, there is only one dialogue possible, the dialogue that arises from the implementation of the law.
This is our guiding thought on this matter.
I said that we are constructing, on the bases and principles of our legal systems in democratic States governed by the rule of law, a democratic Europe governed by the rule of law.
We had a situation that was completely lacking in balance between progress in the field of security and progress in the field of freedom and justice.
The three proposals debated respond, and it was about time, to a request from Europe' s citizens and to the clear political will, at the highest level, of the Heads of State and Government, which, as Mr Watson has clearly pointed out, runs from Vienna to Tampere, and has been strengthened since 11 September at the Extraordinary European Council in Brussels and in Ghent.
These three methods also respond to the principles upon which Europe has been constructed.
Firstly, cooperation and coordination, as seen in Eurojust, where we cooperate and coordinate in order to be more effective in the field of justice.
Secondly, the mutual recognition on which the internal market is based, and this, as the Commissioner has said, a corollary of the confidence between States, which is the fundamental element of the European search and arrest warrant.
Finally, harmonisation wherever this may be necessary and the need for harmonisation with regard to terrorism is obvious, because only six Member States had any legislation covering this area.
Madam President, I trust, no, I am sure, that by voting for these reports with an overwhelming majority tomorrow, Parliament will be giving, as it always has, the political signal that, as responsible representatives of the citizens, we have the obligation to work on the construction of democratic States governed by the rule of law, in those countries in which we are fortunate enough to live.
Madam President, since 11 September, there have been many opportunities to think about and debate upon the consequences of the events of that fateful day and today is no exception.
Without a doubt, the attacks in New York have made us realise that nobody can feel entirely safe from terrorism. When a man and a woman are murdered in Beasaín, as happened last week, for example, each and every one of us is affected, and it is not reasonable to ask the elected representatives of a democracy, Mr Watson, to have to debate under the threat of death.
These events have also reminded us that we were a long way behind in meeting the commitments that the Heads of State and Government had given in Tampere in order to develop the third pillar of the European Union.
The report that we approved by a large majority in committee contains contributions which, in my opinion, are very valid, to the otherwise excellent Commission proposal.
For example, to define street violence as clearly being one form of terrorist expression, or to incorporate a reference to victims and their families and to offer political support and legal protection with the aim of identifying terrorism and bringing terrorists and their supporters to justice through the courts.
This is precisely the purpose of the amendment we tabled in plenary and should be interpreted in this way.
I hope that these and other contributions will be added to the text that the Council is debating, and, in particular, this latter amendment, which I hope the rapporteur will also vote for and will be taken into consideration when the European list of terrorist organisations that Parliament requested is drawn up.
The Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs should fulfil their duty on the 6 and 7 December, and if they do not do so, the Presidency will have to honour its commitment to Parliament to take this issue at Laeken, and if any Member State there is tempted to block a proposal that has the widespread support of our citizens, it seems appropriate to me that closer cooperation should be implemented according to provisions of Article 40 of the Treaty.
The Council' s requests do not date from 11 September.
In September 2000, one year ago, the vast majority of MEPs signed a written declaration requesting the methods that today have been submitted for our consideration.
These are the same methods that we are asking the Commission for in the own-initiative report on the role of the European Union in the fight against terrorism that we approved, also by a very large majority, on 5 September.
Therefore, it needs to be made very clear that none of these measures makes the slightest reduction in the civil liberties of European citizens.
The opposite is the case, we are giving the judicial system instruments to enable it to better protect everyone' s freedom because, faced with the free movement of crime, we must open the doors to the free movement of justice.
Madam President, the two provisions we are debating today respond to both a conviction and an objective: the conviction that we can defeat terrorism and our objective to strengthen the Rule of Law, providing all the instruments necessary to achieve this.
In a democracy, political ideas are put to the test in the voting booth, and not put forward by terrorists.
I am sure that all my fellow Members are of this opinion.
I would like to clearly point out what will be changed by these two initiatives when they are adopted by the Laeken European Council : firstly, Europe will cease to 'show solidarity with' and instead be 'responsible for' .
The solidarity of Europeans with Spanish democrats in their fight against ETA will give way to the responsibility of all European democrats to defeat terrorism.
Secondly, and with regard to the European search and arrest warrant, agreements between governments will be replaced with recognition and cooperation between their various judicial systems.
An injunction will have to be able to be executed without delay, whether it has been issued by a Spanish judge or a French judge, against an individual who is sought in one or other of the countries.
To make my position clear, I feel there should be no more disgraceful spectacles such as the one that took place at Olano.
As well as thinking about the future, however, I cannot help but think with a certain degree of bitterness that these two provisions have come far too late, for the victims.
How different their lives would have been if we had done this earlier!
If only this had been done ten years ago, I am sure that ETA would, by now, have been defeated, and that many of my close friends who have been murdered by ETA would still be here with us, still taking their children to school, giving lectures, writing articles for the press, administering justice, representing their voters.
I would, therefore, ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to reflect upon this tomorrow before you vote.
I would like you to consider that the consequences of this will not only be political, but will, more than anything, be of a human nature, and I would ask the Council to rise, in political terms, to this occasion, and not to miss this opportunity.
There are those that think that politics is the art of the possible.
My opinion is that the purpose of politics is to make what is necessary possible.
I trust that the Fifteen will share this opinion.
I assure you that the defeat of terrorism is possible, and, ladies and gentlemen, you do not realise just how necessary this is.
Madam President, the argument that the anti-terrorism measures and the European arrest warrant do not skimp on fundamental rights, is only sustainable if the protection system of the European Convention on Human Rights for defendants is adhered to in practice.
But that is dependant on the ability of every single judge in the European Union to understand and apply ECHR provisions.
We have no coherent EU programme to ensure they do.
Lest I be thought chauvinist in raising the problem of Britons in Greece, let me criticise my own government in the UK.
They are trying to put through an anti-terrorism bill with a derogation from the ECHR in order to detain suspects without a proper trial, with no legal representation, no judicial review and without being able to hear the evidence given by the intelligence services.
This certainly leaves the UK lacking credibility in a campaign for mutual raising of standards in the EU.
Another worrying development in the UK is the intention to let police and security cooperation measures slip through the Westminster Parliament without proper democratic scrutiny.
Here we debate, but we have no equality with Ministers in deciding the legislation.
Coupled with Council secrecy, this means a very unsatisfactory position in terms of democracy, justice and human rights.
Finally, may I make a direct appeal to Commissioner Vitorino to ensure that organisations acting in the field of raising justice standards, such as the admirable Fair Trials Abroad, can be assisted under the Community budget.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against terrorism is an absolute necessity, the legitimacy of which should not be questioned or we could see our democracies collapse.
However, under no circumstances should it serve as a pretext for gagging our fundamental rights and democratic freedoms.
How can we justify a European proposal to combat terrorism if no added value can be gained from it?
Under the current legislation of the Member States, perpetrators of attacks could not go unpunished.
As the public enemy number one is terrorism, why not limit the European arrest warrant to terrorist offences?
If the illegal capture of State or government facilities, public modes of transport, infrastructures or public places constitutes a terrorist offence or if the legitimate expression of our freedoms of expression and association, our trade union rights, could, in the future, be criminalised or described as terrorism, if those elements are retained, by voting in favour of these reports we will be renouncing all of our democratic rights.
An explicit guarantee of these rights and freedoms must be included in this proposal for a framework directive.
Our fears also extend to certain offences that could fall under the warrant, as the criterion used is that of the sentence, while the accused persons may deserve protection, for example if they are migrants or asylum seekers.
Even those giving support to those people would, in the future, become guilty of terrorism.
A minimum degree of harmonisation of Member States' criminal procedures is necessary in order to safeguard the principle of equality before the law and guarantee the protection of rights in the principle of collegiality.
Furthermore, as minors cannot be the subjects of an arrest warrant, their description for criminal purposes also needs to be harmonised.
If we are to establish an area of security, freedom and justice, these three dimensions need to be fully effective.
Unfortunately, we observe that the security aspect is dominating the policies of the Union and the Member States.
The fight against terrorism needs to be reflected in security for all residents, without exception and in total respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Finally, if a new text has to be adopted by the Council in the future, we hope that this House will be consulted once again.
Madam President, there is an ongoing relationship between the constraints on individual and collective freedoms in the United States and those in Europe, just as there is an ongoing connection in the matter of such freedoms that has been maintained by the United Kingdom government, first with the Reagan/Thatcher partnership and now with the Bush/Blair partnership.
Many European governments are using the criminal terrorist action of 11 September against the United States as an excuse to issue further legislation curbing freedoms which has nothing to do with combating terrorism.
Leaving aside the special military tribunals set up by President Bush, it is enough to reflect upon the recent laws issued or proposed in Italy or in the United Kingdom in order to understand that their objective is to curb and control growing political opposition to a world social and economic order which is unfair and inhuman: the wealth, well-being, growth and development of a fifth of the human race are mirrored by the starvation, lack of resources, ongoing economic decline and underdevelopment of the other four fifths.
It is strange that we can never manage to find a legal formula to define this major social massacre as an act of terrorism, while we had no hesitation in labelling as terrorist acts all those demonstrations of social opposition which have taken place recently in Seattle, Genoa and so forth.
Article 3 of the proposal for a framework decision on terrorism sends a clear message to all those who, in the future, attempt to show their opposition to the neo-liberal monopoly on thinking and the resulting social system.
Women, men, workers, students, the unemployed, pacifists and ecologists will no longer be opposing the system but will be terrorists because - as Hegel, then an old man, wrongly said - 'the real is rational and the rational real' , and for our legislators nothing is more real than the present social and economic disorder and nothing is more irrational, and therefore terrorist, than the need to overthrow and eliminate it.
Lastly, I would like to make it clear that I do support the European arrest warrant and that, as an Italian, I condemn the fact that my country' s government should be the one to oppose a unanimous decision.
It is shameful because the intention of the Berlusconi government in adopting this position is to prevent corruption being listed among the offences on the 'positive' list.
Madam President, after the events of 11 September, Europe and the European institutions must also assume their responsibility and find the courage to achieve a joint agreement between the Member States on combating terrorism and, in general, combating organised crime, without delay.
The legal instruments which will make this fight genuinely effective include the European arrest warrant, which will, at last, replace the complex and excessively bureaucratic extradition procedures which have now become insufficient and inadequate for fighting crime, particularly international crime.
That said, we need to move one step at a time.
The emotion of the tragic terrorist attacks of recent months must certainly prompt us to strengthen judicial cooperation between the Member States without delay, but in speeding up this process we must take things one step at a time and act responsibly.
Indeed, good laws are not compatible with haste or with lack of precision or emotional reactions, particularly when it comes to identifying the offences in respect of which the European arrest warrant is to be applied.
We would therefore express our concern at the Belgian Presidency' s proposal to apply the European arrest warrant to a list of around 30 categories of offences immediately.
In our opinion, terrorism or the trafficking of human beings, to give just two examples, cannot be placed on the same level as counterfeiting or forgery.
It would therefore be more in the general interest to propose and adopt, first of all, with the unanimous consent of all the Member States, an initial, limited list and then, subsequently, to extend this list gradually, thus focusing initially on terrorist crimes, organised crime, the trafficking of drugs, arms and human beings and the exploitation of minors.
Mr President, naturally, measures must be taken to combat terrorism. That much is clear.
Upon reflection, however, it is interesting to note in this context that most countries have adequate rules.
That being said, an extension to the mutual obligation to hand over wanted criminals might be contemplated, but it should be far more restricted than provided for here.
Having said that, I want to say that I have difficulty finding words strong enough to express my rejection of the proposals before us.
That rejection is something I express not only as a politician but, first and foremost, as a lawyer.
I want to say that it is difficult to find even one lawyers' organisation of any kind in the Member States that wishes to endorse these proposals.
They all have major or minor reservations, and many are forthright in their rejection of them because it is a case of the end justifying the means, and the means to be used amount to a violation of what are fundamental ideals in terms of legal rights, something which, for example, Denmark' s General Council of the Bar has come out very strongly against.
In my view, this panic reaction has meant that these proposals have been treated with a quite scandalous disregard for any basic demand that they be properly examined.
These fundamental legal reforms, which are among the most complicated of legislative matter and require an extensive consultation procedure, are to be implemented without any substantial debate on the issues involved and on the basis of, if I may say so, Commissioner, what is, to put it mildly, inadequate preparation.
It is unpleasantly reminiscent of political 'body-snatching' , and that is a violation of fundamental legal rights.
Madam President, there is a pressing need to harmonise judicial standards but I would like to draw the attention of the President and the Members to the need to harmonise the roles of the intelligence and anti-terrorist bodies as well, for otherwise harmonising judicial standards will serve no purpose.
Current events show just how necessary this is, irrespective of the many considerations put forward by Members from the left side of the House which have the effect of shifting our attention away from the numerous dangers presented by the way terrorist groups work and are interconnected.
In fact, by way of example, the revelations published today in the Italian daily newspaper La Repubblica on the change of hands of important nuclear material which is already part of the stock owned by the Mobutu regime, offer a very serious perspective on this trafficking which has taken place and may still be taking place at this very moment in the States of the European Union.
The story of this transaction, the protagonist of which was a former governmental ambassador who was moving freely throughout Europe by virtue of his status as a political refugee, is incredible.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is actually tragic that it took an event like the dramatic terrorist attacks in New York and in Washington to rouse Europe, and the European Council in particular, from slumber, but I am glad that we have managed in such a very short time to put together a package - a counter-terrorism package.
It extends from money laundering, by way of the freezing of accounts, to the measures we are discussing today.
I am glad that, at last, terrorism is defined as an offence in all fifteen Member States and not just in six, as was formerly the case, and can therefore be proceeded against.
I am glad that there is the hope of a European arrest warrant.
I hope that national animosities do not again lead to the postponement of this European arrest warrant, which we so urgently need.
Just go back to Parliament's proposal, when, I believe, the position we took up was a good one.
I am glad that we will make Eurojust a reality and that the enlarged powers to combat terrorism take us another step forward in the right direction.
I am glad that Europol will have joint investigative teams.
All this is very positive in that we are showing the public just what added value the European Union can have.
I demand, though, that currently unresolved points in certain areas be dealt with.
The Member States must finally be required, and with consequences in the event of their non-compliance, to supply Europol with information and to ensure optimum coordination between Eurojust and Europol and appropriate parliamentary management and monitoring.
Parliament has made some excellent proposals on this point, and I congratulate the rapporteur and the whole team of shadow rapporteurs.
I hope that the excellent work they have done will meet with complete support tomorrow.
Following the attacks of 11 September, policy against terrorism had to be tightened in Europe too.
The Commission proposal on the definition and penalty standards for acts of terrorism therefore deserves our support.
However, the Commission proposal on a European arrest warrant with a general scope, and which abolishes the dual criminality requirement across the board is met with less enthusiasm.
This is a bridge too far for a variety of reasons: it pushes countries with a milder climate in terms of criminal law into the defensive and calls into question the fairness of the course of justice.
The proposed general scope is no longer related to combating terrorism.
As such, it constitutes no ground for the enormous political pressure and the break-neck speed of the decision-making process.
Such a proposal revolutionises the application of national and European criminal law and therefore deserves a well considered and transparent decision-making process, preceded by a proper public debate.
Moreover, Parliament is forced to pronounce judgment on the Commission proposal while the Council has, in fact, already turned it on its head: a positive list instead of a negative one, and behind closed doors.
One can hope and expect that the discussion in the Council will eventually culminate in an acceptable compromise, but we do not know this yet and neither are we voting on this tomorrow.
This is why this plenary debate and the vote in this form and at this time are a little absurd and premature, in fact.
For that reason, the delegations of the Dutch Labour Party will abstain from tomorrow' s vote on the Commission proposal for a European arrest warrant.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I will adopt a slightly different position from that of the previous speaker.
The Members of the European Free Alliance will approve the measures to combat terrorism.
We want to strengthen the criminal law measures to combat terrorism.
However, we do want to underline that the term terrorism is to be defined as proposed by the European Parliament, for I am a little wary in that respect.
A moment ago, we discussed the procedural motions on train and plane spotting in Greece and on the people who are imprisoned in this connection.
You may well say that this is a completely unrelated matter, but the sense of justice is very different in the different countries.
Similarly, the keenness with which some label anything and everything as terrorism, makes me a little suspicious.
But the measures should not be exploited by the authorities and neither should it be possible to exploit them.
Some of our representatives of the European Free Alliance struggle more with the European arrest warrant. The approval we grant in this connection is clearly conditional.
The guarantees we want to give are contained in the EP amendments which will hopefully be adopted and which we really consider to be minimum requirements.
If the Council refuses to accept these, we will review our position and convince our colleagues in the national parliaments of the fact that better protection of citizens' freedoms is necessary for a fair course of justice.
In other words, this is about minimum conditions, but further to the speeches of both the acting President-in-Office and Commissioner Vitorino, we are quite optimistic about the right direction which this could be heading.
It is, of course, clear that we must be able to make further progress in the harmonisation of legislation, and in the European judicial procedures involving a European public prosecutor, etc.
A number of people put the federalisation of the Third Pillar first and foremost, and maybe we need to be more pro-active in this direction.
We will not tolerate normal, democratic opposition being muzzled or suppressed, or the actions of trade unions and of movements and associations being thwarted in the name of combating terrorism.
But more than anything, we also want progress to be made in the fight against internationally organised crime.
I have first-hand experience of hopeless situations in the fight to surrender people of whom it had been clearly proven that they had committed crimes.
I therefore want to give you my unqualified support in this matter, but subject to the conditions I have announced.
Madam President, I too would like to join others in welcoming the opportunity to have this debate.
The time is so short that it will not allow us to get fully into all the intricacies and details.
However, I can say at the outset that every one of us is in common cause in opposing terrorism and violence of any kind to further political or other aims To that end, we would support coordination and cooperation between the Member States in protecting the rights and interests of each of the Member States and of the European Union as a whole, as well as its 370 million citizens.
At the Tampere summit we took the first step towards that process.
However, what is before us here today with regard to the European arrest warrant represents a major interference in and alteration of the national criminal justice systems and the civil rights and protections afforded to each individual within each of the Member States.
It is a mistake to move this far, this quickly, without properly understanding or fully recognising the differences between the criminal systems within the European Union.
Therefore, I would urge all Members to support the amendments tabled by myself and my colleagues, in particular, Amendments Nos 92 to 101, which put in place firstly, the requirement for a judicial review or a right to appeal against the warrant at both the executing and issuing stage, secondly, a common list of positive offences, which must be drawn up and not used as a stumbling block, thirdly, no interference with the double jeopardy rule, fourthly, that there must be prima facie evidence presented before the warrant can be enforced, and finally, to ensure that there is a quick trial process where a warrant is issued.
I have represented constituents in other Member States in the European Union where they have been held without trial for two years, without getting any opportunity for habeas corpus or any opportunity to present their case.
Finally, on the overall package on combating terrorism, we have to ensure respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms.
It is no good for the Commissioner to say that we have the Charter of Fundamental Rights: That is only a non-legally binding political decision.
Each Member State has signed up to the European Convention of Human Rights which puts in place specific provisions for each individual.
I note that one Member State, just in the last week, has ridden roughshod over the rights and liberties of individuals.
We as a European Parliament, representatives of a transnational organisation, should not allow this to continue.
I would like to use the brief speaking time I have to highlight the plight of the too-soon forgotten victims of terrorism.
I sat in the home of one of my constituents the other day, a woman who lost her husband because he was a member of the army and had been killed by IRA terrorists.
When she came to get compensation for her three sons - just young boys - they offered her a paltry few hundred pounds for each son.
I could go on and list a sad litany of how terrorist victims have been treated.
This Parliament should realise that these people need special treatment.
The governments responsible should ensure that treatment is provided to bring some alleviation of the awful hurt and sorrow they bear.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is very difficult to talk about such sensitive issues when there is so little time available but I would like to confirm that, contrary to what many speakers have said, we have increased protection following 11 September and drawn up a raft of measures which include those we are debating this evening.
However, last year, we instituted Eurojust and we have already delivered one major opinion, as has been mentioned, to the effect that Eurojust should harmonise judicial cooperation within Europe.
Today, we are taking a large step forward. We are taking a quantum leap towards laying the foundations for the institution of a European public prosecutor in the future, and I therefore feel that the area of justice in which all this is taking place is gaining in significance, and it is not an area of repression, Mr Vitorino, but an area of freedom.
I am sure you have drawn inspiration from these principles. I believe that this is an issue of primary importance on which we are about to deliver an opinion and which we feel will certainly open up a whole world of cooperation and solidarity in this area.
There are clearly specific problems and they clearly concern the arrest warrant, which merits close reflection.
Only Mr Di Lello could be so superficial and irresponsible as to cast such hasty aspersions on the Italian government.
I do not feel this is fair.
The legal institutions have their own procedures, and we are fine-tuning this European procedural law, this European area, but it is clear that we must proceed with great caution and not draw up a list of offences, for we would never finish adding to it, and any list of offences will clearly never be comprehensive.
We must realise that transnational crimes do exist, that the crime of international terrorism does exist, Madam President, and that it is a sensitive, significant and tragic issue in today' s society. All we have to do, and it must be our priority, to combat it is, of course, to coordinate the activities.
Italian procedural law, for example, has its own peculiarities, and we hope that there will be reasoned, active unanimity within the Council.
Thank you, Madam President.
I certainly welcome the fact that, today, we are finally debating these two reports: the Watson report and the Gebhardt report, although it is unfortunate that this should be a consequence of the tragic events of 11 September in the United States.
However, I think that there is an opportunity here.
We can make an advance of fundamental importance, a giant step forward in complying with the Tampere agreements and in creating a European area of freedom, security and justice, that everybody wants, respecting the balance between freedom and security, the importance of which no one doubts.
And, most importantly, we shall be able to provide our own small contribution to the solution of this difficult, complex and painful problem that weighs heavy upon us and knows no borders, which is terrorism.
Parliament carried out its work before 11 September and it continues to do so now: I am referring to the Resolution we approved on 5 September.
The Commission has proved its fast reflexes in proposing the framework decisions that we are debating today.
We hope that the European Council is also able to rise to the occasion and makes the right decisions as along the lines of those made by the Commission and that Parliament is making today, and that, at the Laeken Summit, it responds to the demands of Europe' s citizens to close the net ever tighter on terrorists and terrorism in general, despite the technical difficulties, and to appropriately punish the guilty parties who have spilt the blood of so many innocent people and who have cruelly and pointlessly ended so many lives.
Madam President, when we were discussing the Schengen Agreement, one of the most frequent objections raised was that the borders would stop policemen and judges but not criminals.
That was a logical objection, although the Schengen Agreement did represent a step forward.
Well then, the instruments that the Council is about to adopt now, particularly the European arrest warrant, are the answer to these objections.
At last, borders will no longer stop judges and police.
I therefore see the European arrest warrant as a huge step forward in European integration too, and that is why I find the position of the Italian government, which is showing concern at the inclusion of offences, particularly financial offences, in this list, frankly incomprehensible.
I hope that the government will review its position in the coming days and I call upon the Commission and the Council of Ministers to pursue this path, which I feel is quite appropriate given that investigations of any kind include inquiries of this nature.
I would, moreover, point out that, last July, Parliament - including Mr Gargani and the Forza Italia group too - almost unanimously adopted the other Watson motion, which called precisely upon the Council to adopt a decision providing for a European search and arrest warrant in the area, and I would stress this, of corruption and fraud as well.
There is, therefore, already a precedent but, in any case, I feel that this is the right path to take to achieve security and justice in Italy and Europe.
Madam President, I come from a country that has been stunned by the most atrocious totalitarian horror, which seeks to spread terror by indiscriminate and relentless killings.
I can say, with pride, looking at my colleague Bárbara Dührkop, and at so many victims, and almost with emotion, that in my country, nobody has given into the temptation of implementing or asking for emergency measures.
Something that has never been understood and which no one has ever been able to tolerate in Spain is that once murderers have crossed a border that, theoretically, no longer exists, they are not pursued with the same vigour with which they are pursued in Spain.
There is no technical reason, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that can justify this, and no European citizen will accept the explanation that, for technical reasons, we are unable to make progress on tracking down terror and crime.
A common definition of the crime of terrorism and common sanctions are needed, as we have heard the Commission say so many times, to prevent there being safe havens in Europe where criminals can escape prosecution.
These measures would also send out a clear political message of the European Unions' commitment to this issue.
We can say the same of the proposal for the mutual recognition of final decisions that we have agreed to call the European search and arrest warrant.
We support the Commission' s proposals for improvements on extradition between Member States and the elimination of the double jeopardy rule.
I also hope that the Council will take Parliament' s wishes into consideration.
I think, Madam President, that extending judicial cooperation in the fight against terrorism and crime is the way to become more effective whilst not reducing, by any means, the very freedom that terrorists and criminals are seeking to destroy.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would first of all like to rectify an omission during my presentation.
I forgot to thank and congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent work and I therefore do so now.
I feel that today' s debate is a very good illustration of the difficulty of the exercise, if I may use that word, of the task that we have before us, which consists of accepting both what Mrs Terrón i Cusí has just said, namely that terrorists should not have the freedom to repeat the atrocious crimes that they have committed, but, at the same time, we need to ensure that the fundamental freedoms which we all hold dear are also respected.
That, in a nutshell, is what is making our task so difficult.
I have tried to explain to you the approach that we are taking to this matter and that we have the twofold concern to work quickly but not negligently, to ensure respect for our fundamental freedoms as well, which should be constant, including the right to defence for those who are accused and including victim' s rights, as the victims should also receive all the necessary attention and care.
We are trying to combine all of that, and it is clearly not an easy task, especially because, as you well know and has also been pointed out in this debate, what is more, the different Member States do not have the same legal or judicial traditions.
All of that needs to be reconciled too.
What I can tell you, and this is my final point, is that we will continue to keep this twofold concern in mind, and it is with this in mind that we will try, with the support and guidance of the Commission, of course, to complete our task successfully.
Finally, just to be on the safe side, I want to confirm once again, as I did during my introductory speech, that we will, of course, ensure that action taken in the context of the exercising of political or trade union rights can under no circumstances be defined as a terrorist act or, therefore, engender the application of the new mechanisms that we are working.
Madam President, I would firstly like to say to Mr Krarup that no, we have not acted hastily, we have been working for over a year in consultation with national experts and university lecturers.
We have always listened to experts.
It cannot be said that our proposal has not been thought out.
I categorically refute this.
Secondly, I would like to say that there is no need to worry, ladies and gentlemen.
As the Minister has just said, the definition of terrorism has been improved during the Council' s work.
It is entirely in line with the 1977 Council of Europe Convention.
It is entirely consistent with the Indian proposal which is now under discussion at the United Nations in New York, and I can assure you that it is completely clear in the recitals that we do not include anti-globalisation demonstrations or trade union action in the scope of terrorist activities.
It is so clear that I would describe it as Cartesian.
You will see this from the texts.
Finally, I would like to say that the Commission' s conscience is quite clear.
We understand the political difficulty and, even, the political drama, constituted by this enormous step forwards that we are taking in order to make Europe an area of freedom, security and justice, and we know that, ultimately, what we need to do is to be true to the values, as I am sure we will be, of respect for the rule of law and the fundamental freedoms of the citizens, but, at the same time, we know that with freedom comes the responsibility to resolutely combat crime and terrorism, and we will therefore combat crime and terrorism resolutely.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 8.25 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Aviation safety
Mr President, the tragic events of 11 September in the United States have given new impetus to the reinforcement of arrangements for aviation security.
The European Council meeting the day after the terrorist attacks on the USA instructed the Transport Council to evaluate the measures to be taken to improve aviation security and complete its consideration of those already proposed.
The draft regulation itself was fairly straightforward and has been amended.
However, the attached technical annex, Document 30, based on the European Civil Aviation Conference - or ECAC - was found to be out of date.
Whilst Parliament has responded speedily to the challenge, we believe that this should not lead to a lower level of parliamentary scrutiny and we reserve the right to amend in second reading the revised annex to this regulation adopted by the Council in its common position.
I have met with representatives from the Council and Commission and have consulted widely with the industry.
Due to the difficulty with the annex, as mentioned earlier, I chose to proceed with the report along the following lines: to work with the draft regulation and annex without amending the original annex as given to Parliament but to reserve the right to a second reading after the Council's common position has been adopted.
This option accords with established procedures and ensures proper scrutiny.
The draft regulation concerns, principally, access control and passenger luggage and freight screening on the ground at airports and is outlined fully in my explanatory statement.
The scope does not extend to on-board security which may need to be addressed at some future date.
The technical standards themselves are those adopted by ECAC in 1992 in Document 30, part 2, relating to security issues revised in January 2001 and, as mentioned, currently being updated.
ECAC membership extends to 38 European States including all EU Member States.
It is worth pointing out to Parliament that this agreement reached by the 38 countries will set a precedent in so far as for the first time the agreement will have binding force upon its contracting parties.
Document 30 had previously been used for general guidance only.
Following on from the joint resolution which Parliament adopted at the last plenary session on the subject of aviation, the key areas for amendment to this text are as follows: first, Member States assume responsibility for additional security costs in the light of the terrorist attacks; second, inspections of airports should be unannounced if airports are to be inspected under real operating conditions; third, Member States take responsibility in assisting employers in the screening of employees engaged in all security tasks, not least because employers are not always entitled to access personal data due to strict privacy laws; fourth, where there is a requirement for structural modifications at airports a six month time-limit will be implemented; and fifth, that a procedure be formulated, as is currently the case in ECAC, that would allow industry access to the Comitology Committee without running into problems of existing legal structures.
In addition, on a general point, we are calling for more effective international cooperation in the area of exchange of information for security purposes.
To conclude, we are all aware of the catastrophic effects on the aviation industry and tourist sector as a result of 11 September.
Around 200 000 directly-related jobs have already been lost worldwide, 30 000 in the EU alone, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.
It is not only big businesses which have been affected but also thousands of small businesses, such as small aviation clubs who produce the pilots of tomorrow.
Airlines, airports, manufacturers, hotels, the transport sector are all reliant on finding a solution to this problem.
This report is not the sole solution but it is a step in the right direction provided that the Member States recognise their moral duty to protect their citizens and accept their responsibility to assist in the financing of these additional security measures.
It is quite clear that urgent action must be taken to restore public confidence which, in turn, would assist the aviation industry, the tourism sector and the European Union as a whole.

Mr President, my group would naturally like to help in the rapid creation of common security rules for civil aviation. This is self-evident after the events of 11 September.
In our opinion, there are four points at issue which we included in our amendments. In this respect, we want to take account of the interests of the industry, in which security and a fair distribution of the burden and expenses involved, must be the overriding factor.
First of all, we must aim to achieve the highest possible level of security when it comes to the protection of airports and their users.
This is also the least citizens can expect from us.
Secondly, additional measures which will probably be taken at a later date, must be verified against the implementation of present legislation.
This means that we will need to consider very carefully whether what is being proposed will also be viable in practice.
The third point is that the Commission, in tandem with the ECAC and the ICAO, must determine whether airports in third countries, in other words, airports outside the scope of the Regulation, meet essential security conditions, for any loopholes in the new system will surface particularly at those airports.
I know from my own experience how to board a plane in Albania without passing through bomb control.
The fourth and last point is that we would like uniform rules to finance the proposed measures in order to prevent unfair competition.
This could be government aid, provided that that is directly linked to the extra expenditure in connection with the present Regulation.
It should also be demonstrated, of course, that the aid is really needed.
The industry itself, operators and users, must also bear a proportion of the costs.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament, the Council and the Commission are united in agreeing that efforts must be made to increase the safety of air travel.
The discussions that have just begun show, too, that we are fundamentally in complete agreement with this.
The events of 11 September have, of course, revealed additional deficiencies, which we have to consider in isolation from the structural problems already suffered by many airlines.
The two must not be confused.
We are of the opinion that there is room for improvement in all the areas relevant to security - the airports, the aprons, the registration and clearing of luggage, even on board the aircraft itself.
My group and I also take the view that, since safety is in the public interest and must be guaranteed for every citizen who uses airlines, public funds must also bear their share of the costs that an increase in safety entails.
This, of course, demands standardised European procedures, without which we will not solve the problem, and because competition would be distorted if the burden were to revert to the airports or the airlines.
We are, of course, aware that we have a problem.
There is, generally in Parliament, constant discussion of liberalisation, meaning that we now want to use public funds to improve safety in this liberalised sector.
This, of course, means that we have to talk in general terms about what standards can and must be applied in order to use public money to intervene in liberalised markets.
Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me firstly to express my gratitude to this House, to this Parliament, for including the theme of security in civil aviation on the agenda for this part-session.
I would also like to thank you for your promptness and speed in dealing with this subject, given the urgent nature of the current situation.
I would like to congratulate the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on having concluded its first reading of the Commission proposal in such a short time, because although this has been achieved very quickly, it must be added that this has not been done to the detriment of the quality of work carried out, and with regard to this I would particularly like to thank Mrs Foster, the rapporteur for this initiative, for the excellent work she has carried out despite the urgency of the situation, the lack of time and also for having carefully listened to all the sectors involved, which is the best way of undertaking such work.
Taking the gravity of the situation into account and the need to give an immediate response, and considering the mandate of the European Council of 21 September, our objective was to conclude an agreement before the end of the year.
In her report, Mrs Foster fully recognises the need to strengthen, in a standardised way, the security requirements applicable to civil aviation since 11 September.
I am pleased to be able to tell you that the Commission is, generally speaking, in agreement with the report, given that it supports our intention of introducing common security standards for civil aviation in the European Union, of establishing a Community inspection system aimed at checking the effectiveness and uniformity of these standards, and, therefore, and on this point I insist, at improving the security measures that, as Mr Wiersma or Mr Markov pointed out, are absolutely necessary and urgent.
With regard to the proposed amendments, we can, in principle, accept the first part of Amendment 14, which refers to the gradual introduction of specific security measures, although the measures involved and the timetable will have to be slightly adjusted.
A series of amendments is dedicated to ensuring that part of the implementation costs of the security measures are covered by the Member States of the European Union, on a permanent or temporary basis.
With regard to these amendments, the Commission fully agrees with the spirit of Nos 1, 6, 10, 11, 15, 19, 21 and 22, and can accept them in principle, even though they raise important issues relating to the method of financing the security measures.
We will have to take a look at the exact wording they will need in order for the Commission to adopt them.
Today, the situation can vary between one county and another, even between one airport and another; however, the Commission does not think that this factor could improve the effectiveness of the security measures.
The Commission communication of 10 October, on the economic impact of the terrorist attacks, suggested that the financing, with public funds, of additional security measures could be considered a positive move. However, I am sorry to have to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that this measure was not received with any great enthusiasm by the Council, to put it mildly.
To tell the truth, it was not supported by the majority of States in the European Union.
This is how I know that making such a reference in the current regulation will cause serious problems in the Council, although, I repeat, we agree with Parliament' s position, because we are aware of the tremendous crisis the European Aviation Sector is experiencing at the moment.
This is a sector that is also having to face competition, often unfair competition, from American companies that are benefiting from significant direct aid, provided by the Administration of that country.
It is also possible that the financing of provisions that are not directly related to the improvement of security will not be included in this regulation.
However, with the aim of finding a solution to the significant problem of financing additional measures, I repeat that I am ready to undertake an analysis of the need to harmonise the organisation and financing of security controls in Member States, given what is happening in the United States, and to make the proposals necessary to take the result of this analysis into account.
With this action, the Commission would be taking account of the opinion demonstrated by this Parliament through the various amendments that will surely be approved tomorrow.
With regard to Amendment No 7, which proposes the removal of a Community control mechanism aimed at checking the proportionality and justification of stricter security measures in civil aviation adopted by Member States, the Commission must reject this amendment, even though Parliament and Council are of the same opinion.
We think that it is legitimate to grant the Commission the power to prevent artificial restrictions that are justified for economic reasons.
Amendment No 9 suggests that the results of the Community inspection reports should be sent to each airline.
These reports, ladies and gentlemen, contain general information on the implementation of the regulation by European Union Member States, and on the functioning of their own quality control systems and their ability to detect faults.
However, they do not include details such as the indication of the level of risk and its changes from airline to airline, and therefore, passing on these reports will not contribute to improving individual security, and with this in mind, the Commission cannot accept the content of this amendment.
Other amendments have been rejected because they cause legal problems, as is the case with the last paragraph of Amendment No 14, for example, Amendment No 5, which changes the reference standards produced by an external organisation, the ECAC, Amendment No 12, which goes against comitology procedures, Amendment No 17, which would delay the entry into force of the regulation, making it subject to an impact study, without there being any indication of the final decision.
The remaining amendments improve or clarify the text and the Commission can accept them with slight changes to their wording.
The Commission could also accept Amendment No 20, but would point out that implementing its extraterritorial effects on the basis of bilateral or multilateral controls would be a complicated matter.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has spared no effort to try to achieve, or to facilitate, an agreement between the Council and Parliament at first reading, on a subject that is so important and, above all, urgent.
I fear that this may not be possible given the absence of prior agreement on tomorrow' s vote.
I think, however, that in the near future, in March, we could be in a position where we have a text, slightly late, it must be said, but if this results in a better quality text and better proposals, this is not such a serious issue, since some of the methods we have discussed here are already being directly implemented by Member States.
Thank you, Mr President.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Foster once again.
And I would also like to thank Parliament for the urgency and effort it has afforded this measure, which is of fundamental importance, and I hope that in March we will finally reach full agreement between all the institutions.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Communities' financial interests
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
A5-0390/2001 by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the criminal-law protection of the Community' s financial interests. [COM(2001) 272 - C5-0225/2001 - 2001/0115(COD)];
A5- 0393/2001 by Mr Bösch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Commission annual report 2000 on the protection of the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud [COM(2001) 255 - C5-0469/2001 - 2001/2186(COS)] and on the Commission communication on protecting the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud - Action plan for 2001-2003 [COM(2001) 254 - C5-0470/2001 - 2001/2186(COS)]
Mr President, protection of the Community's financial interests is a concept that the citizen out there finds difficult to understand.
But it is of deep concern to him, as someone who pays his taxes, that his money should be used for the development and extension of a united Europe and that it should not be misused or employed for the purposes of fraud or other kinds of criminal activity.
He has every right to demand that the European institutions to which he entrusts his money will handle it carefully and that, should frauds be committed, these will be detected and punished.
The message we must get across is that we are using every available means to justify the citizen's trust.
The means to hand have, though, been blunt weapons to date, and there has been increased leakage from the Community budget due to criminal practices - figures show it as having doubled to over EUR 2 billion in the past year.
The percentage of undetected crime, may well, by the way, be even higher.
Despite better detection of fraud, judicial cooperation across frontiers is limping along, far behind multinational organised crime.
The Council, the Commission and Parliament have been lamenting this situation for years, but little or nothing has as yet been done about it.
The agreement on protection of the Community's financial interests, signed in Cannes all of six years ago, and the protocols appended to it, have still not been ratified by all the Member States and are therefore not in force.
Despite all the appeals and resolutions by Parliament, and several summit declarations by the Council, there is still no common European legal area to protect the Community budget, indeed, not even an unambiguous definition of the concept of fraud against Community funds. Still less are any investigations carried out or punitive sentences handed down, which must be in equal measure effective, proportionate and deterrent.
This blockade situation has now seen the Commission produce a proposal for a directive which recalls elements of the 1995 agreement and incorporates parts of them in the protocols, a proposal which, incidentally, Parliament had already made before the 1995 Summit.
The Commission, rightly, bases its proposal upon Article 280(4) of the Treaty of Amsterdam under which the Community is obliged to play an active part in protecting its funds.
This should circumvent the sterile debate about allocation to the first or third pillar of the Treaty, particularly as the Treaty of Nice affirms that the protection of the Community's finances belongs in the first pillar.
So we should not lose ourselves in legal analyses, but send a clear signal.
For us, the criminal-law protection of European funds against criminal misuse is a serious matter.
We therefore welcome the Commission's proposal for the harmonisation of national legislation.
It can, though, only be a first step towards the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's Office to protect Community financial interests, something that was called for at the IGC for the Treaty of Nice but was not, unfortunately, actually discussed.
Mrs Schreyer, we are waiting impatiently for the Green Paper from the Commission on this subject.
It would have been a good thing if we had already had this Green Paper together with the proposal for a directive.
In order to make good this deficiency, the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgetary Control call for the next revision of the Treaties to include the establishment of a European State Prosecutor's Office, on the corpus juris model and appertaining to the first pillar.
The course must be set for this as early as the Laeken Summit.
The Committee on Budgetary Control proposes, as an intermediate step without amending the Treaty, the establishment of an internal financial prosecutor in accordance with the three-phase model in the second report of the Committee of Wise Men.
As has already been said, we welcome the Commission's proposal, but call for an effective instrument, that is to say, a regulation rather than a directive.
Why?
Directives commit the Member States to objectives, whilst regulations prescribe the instruments they are to use to achieve those objectives.
The proposal for a directive is meant to insert into the criminal law of all the Member States a standard definition of offences such as fraud, corruption, money-laundering etc. to the detriment of the Community Budget.
There is no doubt that a regulation is the legal instrument to be preferred in order to avoid new confusion of the sort that there has been in the past.
I strongly invite Parliament, the Commission and the Council to now go down this necessary political road together.
I ask you to adopt my report, on which no amendments have been tabled.
Mr President, if you take a look at the figures for fraud and the irregularities affecting the European Budget in the year 2000, you see, above all, a massive increase in the irregularities that have come to light.
Just so we can put this beyond dispute for once: for the taxpayer, it is essentially irrelevant whether it is a question of fraud or irregularity; the money has been improperly spent.
Now, one can, of course, argue about whether more fraud is actually being committed or whether it is being cleared up more effectively, or whether there are more irregularities.
I tend to think it is probably a combination of these.
The Commissioner may well think differently, but we cannot go so far as to say that having discovered 100% irregularities means that we have had the best way of combating fraud, because then we will not have any budget left.
In my position - and perhaps the Commissioner responsible was herself once a Member of this House in a past life - and in this situation, one asks oneself what would happen in a business if the management presented figures like these one year.
Here, we are always coming up against the fact that people say we are among the best administrations.
We are striving to be that.
I think that what would happen would be something quite different from what the Commission expects from us as an action plan.
The actual point of my report is that I believe we should just consider where this road might take us.
Mrs Theato has already mentioned one possibility, and an important one at that, which we will not be able to avoid if we want to make changes.
We must address the issue of a European State Prosecutor, and do it without excuses about amendments to the Treaty.
The possibilities are already there in the Treaties.
Your opposition to it, Mrs Schreyer, is your own business, but we will not carry on standing idly before our taxpayers and tell them that we just cannot do anything.
That is not what we have a Commission for.
The Commission is there to act, and of that I would remind you, Mrs Schreyer.
In exactly the same way, we must give greater priority to the protection of the EU's financial interests in the applicant countries.
There were, and are, proposals on this which amount to saying that we will, at some point, have to let our anti-fraud unit be active in an advisory capacity, which we know already.
As the example of Slovakia has shown, the point at issue is not the acceding countries, but the continuing inability of this Commission to get a proper grip on the problematic aspects of enlargement, so that our fellow citizens might get the idea that enlargement has been prepared for in such a way, including financially, that they can happily say yes to it.
The Commission bears great responsibility in this respect.
Madam Commissioner, I am inclined to think that, when one has to submit those sorts of figures and turn them into something tangible, one has to seize every available opportunity to improve matters.
My final point is on an issue on which it would be good if we could seize the opportunity for common action.
It has to do with a question that I will raise now.
Mrs Schreyer, the plan is to appoint Mr Alberto Perduca as Director of the operational department of OLAF, the anti-fraud office.
His qualifications as a public prosecutor, his experience in combating the mafia, and also his experience at an international level make him the ideal man for the job.
Unfortunately, his appointment has been blocked for months now by the new Italian government.
Perhaps, Mrs Schreyer, you might tell us what the Commission has done about this to date.
Would personal intervention by the President of the Commission not be necessary in this case?
Has this, as is to be hoped, already taken place?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1995 the Member States jointly signed a convention under which, in order to safeguard Community interests and finances, the Member States make fraud against Community finances a punishable offence.
Subsequently, further protocols were signed also specifying corruption and the laundering of money derived from fraud against Community finances as criminal offences.
There is actually nothing wrong with this convention and the protocols except that they have not all been ratified yet and therefore they are still not in force.
I do not deny that in the year 2000 there was some movement in the direction of ratification.
Whenever I have met with finance ministers I have constantly repeated my request that they be ratified, but the speed is determined by the slowest.
The protocol that makes money laundering a crime has so far been ratified by only seven Member States.
So you can see how long it would take if we were to wait for the process to be completed.
We cannot accept that; that is why we have put forward the proposal for a directive that converts the main content of the protocol and the convention into a directive; this has already been discussed in Parliament on a number of occasions and has repeatedly been called for by the President himself.
I would like to thank you, Mrs Theato, and, of course, the committee as a whole, for joining us in saying that things have gone far enough and we are now going to use Community law and not rely on the convention, the third pillar instrument.
The Committee on Budgetary Control has tabled many amendments that were voted on in the Committee.
The Commission shares the objective and concern expressed by many of these.
But the Commission believes the present proposal for a directive is not in legal terms the right place for the vast majority of the amendments.
I must therefore ask you not to take the proposal for a directive as some kind of tree on which to hang many wishes, concerns and suggestions, correct as these may be.
That is especially the case with the European Public Prosecutor.
Again a word on that, Mr Bösch. Of course, the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties.
In our clear analysis Article 280 does not, as it appears in the Treaty, lend itself to that, not even the 'little' public prosecutor, to use that term again.
In our estimation, and other people do share this view, there is no basis in law for the OLAF Supervisory Committee.
Neither would it be possible to choose the instrument of the regulation, because the proposal as you now have it provides, for example, for the European Court of Justice to have an investigating judge.
But the duties of the Court of Justice and its judicial functions are laid down in detail in the Treaty.
It is, therefore, not possible to use a regulation to institutionalise a new investigating judge.
That, too, requires an amendment to the Treaty.
But we shall be presenting the Green Paper in a few weeks' time, as Mrs Theato has mentioned.
The Green Paper will, of course, initiate a wide-ranging discussion.
I am sure that, as protagonists of this proposal, you will take this discussion to the experts and to the Member States, so that we do not have a repeat of the situation we had in Nice, where there were only reservations and no agreement.
In our opinion, there is no legal basis for some of the other amendments, either.
Provisions concerning cooperation between the national criminal prosecution authorities would be incompatible with Article 280 of the Treaty since they are concerned with the application of the Member States' criminal law and their administration of criminal justice.
Neither can the Commission go along with the suggestion of converting the directive into a regulation, since the Community cannot, at present, create law that is directly applicable in the Member States.
I understand your concern and in view of the present situation I, of course, also support the call for your wish to be met swiftly, but we are a long way from a situation where the European Community can create directly applicable law.
I am sure that this would really not meet with the agreement of the national parliaments either.
The Commission is able to agree without reservation to Amendment No 2 and No 11. They underline, once again, how important the introduction of the new Article 280 is for protecting the Community' s financial interests.
Amendment No 27, which provides for custodial sentences, possibly leading to extradition, is essential for effectively fighting economic crime, and the Commission would also like to agree to the first sentences of Amendment No 3 and No 7 if these should be voted on separately tomorrow.
I also want to explicitly say that the proposals for extending the list of offences for the protection of financial interests are very worthy of note and, in my opinion, very much worthy of consideration, namely that market-rigging and abuse of office should be included.
It is really more a question here of the strategy to be adopted.
The Commission' s proposed strategy is to adopt the wording of the convention, more or less, as it stands and to present the Member States with a situation where they have already agreed to this very text and there is, therefore, now no reason to convert it into another instrument that sets a clear time for its transposition.
That is one of the legislative measures the Commission is putting forward to protect the Community' s financial interests.
The Commission has listed the proposals we put forward in the year 2000 in the fraud prevention report, for example the proposal to amend the money laundering directive, the proposal to prevent counterfeiting of the euro or measures to combat product piracy.
That is all part of preventing fraud, after all.
The Commission' s report also contains 50 pages listing the measures taken by the Member States to protect Community finances in the years 1999 and 2000.
It starts with Belgium extending its customs administration' s powers to a twelve mile zone outside coastal waters and includes, for example, the creation of a central control information system by Denmark' s customs and tax administration and an increase in staff at Spain' s general inspectorates for agricultural expenditure in the regions.
The United Kingdom has, for example, set up a coordination point for general investigations involving the Structural Funds.
For the Structural Funds, the rapporteur, you, Mr Bösch, has included the Court of Auditors' highly critical report, which highlights the differences between the Member States in the application of the regulation that irregularities in the implementation of the Structural Funds must be reported.
I can assure you that I share your criticism and that of the Court of Auditors.
We are, therefore, working very hard with the Member States to get a more uniform and above all a more thorough implementation of this reporting regulation.
And this is beginning to bear fruit.
I really must reiterate: even if we will probably continue to differ on the interpretation, in earlier years, transposition was extremely hesitant.
We have found that it took ages for an irregularity to be reported.
It is now de facto better, but that, of course, also means that more irregularities are being reported.
It is like police statistics.
Is it a good thing or a bad thing when the number of cases the police detect rises or falls?
I really must therefore ask you not to discredit those Member States that take their reporting of irregularities seriously and make frequent reports as required by the Regulation by saying they are the 'strongholds' , because it is a difficult instrument.
There is, as it were, a negative incentive: the more irregularities are reported, the more information we naturally have on the basis of which to make financial corrections.
We cannot do without this mechanism.
I also agree with the rapporteur, I agree with you, Mr Bösch, that we must make the statistics more meaningful so we can see which are the new reports and which were already in the statistics before.
Above all, we must look at what has been the result of the reports, what measures have been taken.
OLAF is working on it, the Directorate-General for the Budget is working on it, the Directorate-General for the Regions is working on it, but it is a laborious business.
I am sure we will not have the success we are actually looking for next year either, but we will see that they are becoming more meaningful, as it were, sector by sector.
It also depends on cooperation with the Member States, and OLAF is working closely with the so-called COCOLAF.
I can inform you, however, that every suspected case of fraud, especially in the Structural Funds, is passed on to OLAF.
The most common irregularities with the Structural Funds are concerned with cases where, for example, the Member States approve projects after the period for support has actually finished.
Irregularities also appear, in particular, because other Community policies are not followed.
One quite frequent irregularity is that projects have been approved without an environmental impact assessment being made first.
A lot of money is spent on infrastructures, and that is a very common error, as I said.
If you now ask what damage results, that is, of course, difficult to say.
There is no financial damage, but there may be environmental damage because the environmental impact assessment was not carried out.
Regarding the financial corrections, another important point, we shall have tighter rules for the new support period.
In the report, you have now called for all irregularities affecting financial corrections and the Structural Funds reported in the period from 1995 to 2000 to be listed individually by 15 December.
We do not have that information available and will not have it available so quickly.
The Commission can promise that we will now try to get this information direct for the new irregularity reports in a way that makes the reports meaningful so that we can see which irregularities result in financial loss.
How is the protection of financial interests directive likely to be treated in the Council?
Unfortunately, some Member States have already taken quite a clear stance against this directive on grounds of legal dogma.
You have mentioned this.
All the Member States say in the Council, yes, of course, we must do something about this, but then they argue no, that is something that belongs in the third pillar, not in the first pillar.
I would like to see the justice ministers who argue in this way, doing so in a public debate.
Nobody would understand it.
And the population will not accept them saying they can do nothing because one thing is the first pillar but another is the third pillar and the Community can only take action in the third pillar.
It is quite clear that the protection of Community interests requires Community instruments, and I am very pleased and very grateful to you that the European Parliament and the Commission are pulling in the same direction here.
Mr President, those involved in the construction of Europe have always been prepared to take risks. This has certainly been the case as far as the protection of the Community' s financial interests is concerned.
Parliament, notably its Committee on Budgetary Control, has indeed taken risks. We should pay tribute to the determination shown by Mrs Theato who chairs that Committee and is one of the rapporteurs.
Whatever is achieved in this field will be largely due to her efforts.
Having said that, I must admit that along with many other Members I share the Commission' s concern.
We need to work towards creating an area of justice, but we must do so in a responsible manner. Throughout the whole process of the construction of Europe, the forces attempting to hinder it have consistently taken advantage of the mistakes made by more enthusiastic individuals when they lose sight of the Treaty.
This is why I am bringing a critical note into today' s debate.
I do not wish to argue against the concept of a European Public Prosecutor, but I am concerned about laying down the details of the necessary statute. It is indeed a transitional statute but a statute nonetheless.
The House needs to give due consideration to this office. Not only should the Committee on Budgetary Control give it due consideration, but so should the House itself.
Such consideration should also involve dialogue with other institutions, notably the Commission. Not until that has taken place will we be in a position to move forward together and present a proposal consistent with the Treaty.
The same applies, in my view, to the Commissioner' s comments on the rapporteur' s idea of resorting to a regulation in place of a directive.
That is not within Parliament' s competence.
It falls within the competence of our societies and of states governed by the rule of law.
Only in very specific circumstances may direct obligations be imposed on citizens from a Community level.
This is why I have ventured to voice some criticism here today, Mr President. I am, however, full of admiration for the work completed.
I should like, first of all, to thank the two Members for all their work in writing these reports.
They have been tireless workers on fighting fraud in the European Union since they were appointed.
However, there is a problem.
According to the Commission report, there has been a doubling of fraud, in particular, of the revenue collected over the year 2000.
That is of great concern but we must put it into context and remember that much of this is due to Member States not taking fraud seriously.
They are not collecting the money that is due to the European Union, for example, from cigarette smuggling and the money that we could get through taxes.
Member States are also not taking fraud seriously because we still have four Member States who have not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests which means that nobody can move on in terms of fighting fraud.
As regards the Structural Funds, 40% of the money is spent in the Member States and the data we have, in terms of following up where that money is spent, is unreliable.
This situation is quite pathetic.
What do we do when we find fraud?
We pass a file onto OLAF who do the investigation and then it sits on a shelf because nobody prosecutes.
This is a real problem.
Who is going to take responsibility for prosecution?
Only two people have ever been prosecuted by OLAF and this is a green light to fraudsters in the EU.
We must ask if people are against the European Public Prosecutor, then what alternative do they want to see?
We are asking a little bit too much in this report by asking for a regulation.
But we also know that about half the Member States are against this and there is a possibility of losing an opportunity to have a European fraud prosecutor for the EU financial interests.
We may be asking for too much too fast and I am concerned about that, but I respect the Members for really trying to push the boat out on this fraud issue.
Mr President, I too should like to start with a word of thanks to the two rapporteurs.
I know that they have both worked hard on this topic from the outset.
I should first of all like to turn my attention to the Bösch report.
As the Liberal Group, we have tabled a few amendments to this report, to the effect that we consider mid-2002 somewhat premature as a firm deadline for a public prosecutor.
In order to avoid any misunderstandings, we are clearly in favour of a public prosecutor, but mid-2002 is slightly too early.
In our opinion, more attention should be devoted to the future Member States in Central and Eastern Europe and we would therefore ask the Court of Auditors to issue a report on this as soon as possible, thus enabling us to assess whether these countries are also capable of managing their financial affairs effectively before they accede.
Furthermore, OLAF must obviously work closely together with similar organisations in the new Member States.
We would also like to make our position clear on the Theato report: we are in support of a public prosecutor, but the lion' s share of the amendments that have been adopted in committee, in most cases by one majority vote, go too far in our view.
At this stage, we prefer a directive to a regulation.
We want to avoid a confrontation course with the Council: the line of the Commission is preferable to the abundance of detail in the various amendments.
If these amendments were to be adopted at this stage, we ought to revisit them in the Committee on Budgetary Control, for we believe that, at this stage, matters of this kind should attract the greatest possible consensus and that the decision should not be made by a narrow majority.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, the Prodi Commission' s existing policy on fighting fraud can really only be described as hesitant and dilatory when it comes to the really crucial questions.
And I have very little hope that this will change, especially in the matter of the European Financial Public Prosecutor.
A Green Paper is all the Commission has planned for the remaining years of its term of office.
Your much-vaunted Commission reform programme lacks the crucial safety net.
Those who abuse their freedoms must be capable of being brought to account.
Your first duty ought to have been to clear up the old cases and call those responsible to account.
Instead, you are hiding behind a hesitant judiciary in Belgium and Luxembourg.
To prevent this sad truth from becoming so evident, you are following a policy of concealing information from Parliament, which you now want to get expressly embodied in the Financial Regulation.
You are claiming for yourself the right to decide whether informing Parliament about a procedure is in the European Union' s interest or not.
I would like to have seen you when you were a member of the State Parliament in Berlin, Mrs Schreyer, if the Governing Mayor had told you it was not in the city' s interest to inform you about certain things.
That is precisely how you are presuming to treat the European Parliament today and you clearly fail to appreciate that in so doing you weaken not only this Parliament but, ultimately, also the Commission of which you are part.
Thank you very much, Mrs Stauner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Quality of petrol and diesel fuels
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0389/2001) by Mrs Hautala, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the quality of petrol and diesel fuels (COM(2001) 241 - C5-0197/2001 - 2001/0107(COD)).
Mr President, I am here, this evening, to present a report which relates to the improvement of the quality of fuels.
The European Parliament was involved in drafting this legislation, which was originally approved in 1998, in other words, over three years ago; and Parliament was quite successful in using the co-decision procedure to push through cleaner fuels, which significantly facilitate a reduction in traffic emissions.
Even at that stage, the European Parliament noticed that one crucial factor in improving the quality of a fuel is a reduction in its sulphur content.
In the course of the co-decision procedure and conciliation, we accomplished a significant lowering in the sulphur content of both petrol and diesel, despite the way in which the oil industry stridently emphasised the costs of this programme.
On the other hand, we can state that the motor industry and catalyst industry considered it absolutely essential that these low-sulphur, cleaner fuels would be introduced to the market, since, otherwise, it would not have been possible for them to bring about cleaner, better and more advanced engines which feature lower emissions.
We are now at the directive revision stage, at which the Commission, quite rightly, has noted that sulphur is an even more strategic ingredient in the quality of fuels than we then understood.
The Commission proposes that by 2011 both petrol and diesel fuel should, for all practical purposes, be sulphur-free.
We are talking about very low contents.
This is of essential importance, since it has been observed that the consumption of fuels also falls when the sulphur content is reduced, and, in the meantime, climate policy has become a central objective in the European Union.
We must find all possible means by which we can reduce car fuel consumption.
This is, indeed, one of the most important aims of this proposal.
Hopefully, then, the European Parliament will come to the decision tomorrow that we will attain one hundred percent of the target of getting these sulphur-free fuels on the market as early as 2008, rather than by 2011 as the Commission is proposing.
In our judgment, this is entirely possible, and it will be a positive influence on the development of cars.
The motor industry will be able to develop better and more advanced engines, which will use less fuel.
We are also proceeding from the assumption, which the Commission also proposes, that this introduction to the market shall start in 2005.
It is important that Parliament decides that sulphur-free fuels should be available (by stages) throughout the area of the Union, with the first steps being made in 2005.
We are also demanding that this availability be geographically comprehensive.
Previously, the situation has been that the various Member States have proceeded at slightly different rates with regard to this improvement in the quality of fuels.
The Environment Committee proposes that the Member States be offered the possibility of certain transitional periods or derogations when this directive is next revised.
Parliament is proposing that this revision take place a year earlier than was decided by the Commission: we would like the revision to take place during 2005.
Despite the demands of certain parties, the Environment Committee has decided that in this connection no topics other than sulphur should be involved.
We can then return to the question of fuel quality parameters other than sulphur during the course of the revision in 2005.
In my opinion, this is a well-justified policy, since the Commission will have time to study this topic in the meantime.
I would also like to stress that a transition must be made to using cleaner fuels also in work machinery, or non-road machines of this type.
This is entirely possible: in eight Member States diesel fuels are already being used in work machinery.
Hopefully, Parliament will decide, tomorrow, that these work machines must begin to use cleaner fuels to the same extent as vehicles on the roads.
The Industry Committee accepts the desirability of moving to zero sulphur in petrol and diesel.
The hotter burn of modern vehicle engines delivers higher efficiency and thereby cuts CO2 emissions.
However, the resulting increase in nitrogen oxide has to be dealt with by catalysts and the virtual elimination of sulphur renders the catalysts effective in dealing with these.
A further benefit is a reduction in the emission of particulates, so the Industry Committee is in favour of the Commission proposal.
A majority vote in the committee demanded a rather faster implementation than the Commission proposed even if some of us were concerned at the Commission's assertion that this will, in fact, produce a net increase in CO2 emissions.
So please tell us, Commissioner, if you stand by your warning or whether you can accept the quicker implementation requested by both the Environment and the Industry Committees.
We would also point out that the EU standard of 10 parts per million of sulphur contrasts with an American standard of 15 ppm of sulphur.
This will make it difficult for us to import fuels from the USA in an emergency.
We would also suggest that the Commission instigate research into the implications of ultra-fine particle emissions from gasoline diesel injection engines.
The question of fuel quality for non-road and off-road machinery is still outstanding.
We understand that proposals on this matter will be forthcoming in 2002.
This is surely urgently needed but we urge the Commission to give full consideration to the interests of those in industry and agriculture who operate such machinery.
We give this proposal a fair wind.
Indeed, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy would suggest that the Commission hoists a spinnaker and speeds up its implementation.
Is the Commissioner prepared to accede to this demand?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission undertook a good deal of preliminary work in preparation for this directive.
I refer to the Auto-Oil I and Auto-Oil II programmes. This work resulted in a balanced proposal which is well-documented from a technical point of view.
Congratulations are due to the Commission. I should also like to commend Mrs Hautala, the rapporteur, very warmly on her excellent work.
I agree with her that it is important to make low-sulphur fuels available as soon as possible. This is because technological advances in the automotive industry permit fuel saving, and, more especially, a reduction in polluting emissions.
It is, nonetheless, true that refineries need to consume more energy and emit more polluting gases in order to produce these fuels. Also, the environmental advantages of low-sulphur fuels will not be felt until vehicles currently on the roads are replaced.
It is a matter of balancing out the emissions. We must therefore be pragmatic as regards schedules and adjust the pace of the introduction of the new fuels to the rate of renewal of the existing vehicle population.
Otherwise, we would be forcing users to change their vehicles, but that is not an option.
I do agree that it would be appropriate to reduce the transitional period during which the various fuels could coexist. For the reasons I adduced earlier, however, a degree of flexibility should be afforded to certain countries.
My group therefore proposes that, whilst bringing the date forward, we should retain the option of granting temporary derogations to those Member States who can demonstrate that the balance of air quality will prove negative.
The new fuel ought to be brought in for non-road mobile machinery as well. It should, however, be introduced more gradually in this case, for the same reasons as I outlined in relation to cars.
This is the reasoning behind our Amendment No 40. I invite you to support it.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all cars can take zero-sulphur fuel, whether they are new or old.
They do not have to be converted, there are no parts to be fitted or retrofitted.
That is a big difference from the debate about leaded and unleaded petrol that we had a few years ago.
So any car can take low-sulphur fuel and it has a positive effect, especially with older types of diesel engines.
Zero-sulphur fuel reduces particle emissions from these older vehicles too.
Most of all, however, we need zero-sulphur fuel because we want new technologies to come on to the market, not in order to reduce conventional emissions but to consume less.
We need direct injection diesel engines and direct injection petrol engines that have a wide range of lean burn.
With lean burn, where little fuel is used, the proportion of nitrogen oxide is greater and we therefore need particular technologies to collect nitrogen oxides in the exhaust system.
Look at it which way you will, sulphur prevents that.
To save fuel and reduce CO2 in the transport sector we simply need zero-sulphur fuel as quickly as possible.
I cannot see, either, why a diesel vehicle with an almost negative particulate value - the air behind is cleaner that that drawn in at the front - is allowed on our streets while on the same street there are tractors and excavators giving off particles en masse because of the poor quality fuel.
I believe these vehicles must be required to use clean fuel, too, if we want to cut particle emissions.
Mr President, I want to say a big thank-you to the rapporteur who has produced one of the best reports we have seen for a long time in the fuel and vehicles field.
I agree with most of what the rapporteur has written.
Above all, I want to emphasise the importance of bringing this proposal forward from 2011 to 2008.
It is very good indeed that we should include fuels for non-road mobile machinery and treat the latter in the same way as all other vehicles.
There is no reason at all to accord special treatment to machinery we do not normally see on the roads, but the Commission' s proposal would, if anything, postpone the day when anything advanced could be done in this area.
The fact that the rapporteur proposes a thorough review of alternative fuels and also suggests that we can mix in more ethanol than the five per cent permitted under the present ceiling is also very much to be welcomed.
I have a problem. This concerns the financial incentives.
I understand the rapporteur' s train of thought, but I think the proposal is wrong in the way we have written it because, according to the Treaty, we can have financial incentives right now.
If we insert this into every directive we now adopt, there is a risk of our creating a horizontal approach whereby we instead restrict the opportunities, as interpreted by the Council, of obtaining financial incentives.
Through what we have written today, we are therefore doing ourselves a disservice.
That is something I want the rapporteur to think about.
Mr President, honourable Members, I am very pleased to be able to address the European Parliament in this debate on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Wallström.
I am pleased in one sense, because it enables me to return to a former stamping ground.
I used to be an environment minister in the country I know best.
But I am also unhappy I have to be here because the reason is that Commissioner Wallström is not well.
I wish her a speedy recovery, so that she can perform for me on the Balkans on some future occasion, or even on Egypt.
Can I say as a non-official admirer, as it were, that I recognise that the report by Mrs Hautala contributes significantly to a Commission proposal which will, I would judge bring a combination of environmental and economic benefits to our citizens.
The availability of fuels with a maximum sulphur content of 10 parts per million will remove any remaining technical barriers to the introduction of the most fuel efficient vehicles, which will in turn provide a basis for further reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide.
When used in older vehicles, there would also be substantial reductions in emissions of conventional pollutants leading to better air quality.
Let me turn to the key issues which are raised in the proposed amendments and first of all deal with the timetable in terms which I suspect the honourable lady will find fairly familiar.
Several of the amendments propose that the final date after which all petrol and diesel sold would be subject to a maximum sulphur content of 10 parts per million, should be advanced by three years to the 1 January 2008 with the possibility of derogation for those Member States where that seems to be justified.
The Commission chose the date of 1 January 20ll, with the date for diesel subject to confirmation by 31 December, five years before in 2006, so that all Member States would enjoy a mix of air quality benefits and some reductions in CO2 emissions resulting from 10 parts per million fuel.
Although the Commission is willing to consider some advancement in the final date from 1 January 2011, the Commission does not favour Parliament's approach linked to possible prolongation.
The Commission therefore, cannot accept Amendments Nos 5,11, 15, 18, 23, 31, 32, 38 and 39.
However, the Commission can accept Amendment No 30 related to advancing the date for the review.
The Commission can also accept Amendments Nos 22 and 46 and in part, Amendments Nos 8, 17, 42, 43 and 45, relating to defining in greater detail the availability of petrol and diesel with a maximum sulphur content of 10 parts per million fuel, during the introductory period.
Then there is the question of the quality of fuel used in non-road mobile machinery.
A number of other amendments refer to the need to improve and harmonise the quality of fuel used in this machinery across the Community.
The Commission acknowledges that the relative importance of emissions in this sector continues to grow as the environmental performance of engines used in on-road applications improves.
Indeed, it is already clear that the fuel used in this sector in some Member States will have to be improved in the future.
However, as the work on the next stage of emission standards for compression ignition engines used in non-road applications is not finalised, nor is the required fuel quality for such standards yet identified, the Commission cannot at this point accept Amendments Nos 3, 12, 26, 37 and 40.
Let me turn to some other amendments.
The Commission does not accept Amendments Nos 10, 19 and 27 on fiscal incentives in view of the legal basis of this proposal, nor given the possibilities available to Member States under other Community legislation to fiscally promote cleaner fuels through tax incentives.
On the question of alternative fuels, and bio-fuels in particular, the Commission is pleased to consider this subject in more depth, as work on this subject evolves.
The Commission can therefore accept Amendments Nos 33 and 48 and in principle, Amendments Nos 14 and 44.
The Commission can also accept Amendment No 47 in part, relating to other issues to be taken into account in the review and Amendment No 28, in principle and Amendment No 29, relating to reporting.
Concerning the remaining amendments, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 20, 21, 24, 25, 36 and 41.
We can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 16 and 34. We can also accept Amendments Nos 4, 13 and 47, in part and Amendment No 35, in principle.
Finally, I would like to say that the Parliament has significantly contributed to improving this proposal.
There is humility for you!
I therefore would like to thank the rapporteur once again, for her efforts, her professionalism and her dedication and I would like to thank the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for its input, as well.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Egypt
The next item is the joint debate on:
recommendation (A5-0387/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision on the signature of a Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States and the Arab Republic of Egypt [8220/2001 - COM(2001) 184 - C5-0381/2001 - 2001/0092(AVC)] (Rapporteur: Mr Hughes Martin)
and on oral questions:
B5-0531/01 by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to the Council, on the conclusion of an association agreement with Egypt;
B5-0532/01 by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to the Council on the conclusion of an association agreement with Egypt.
Pursuant to rule 146 of the Rules of Procedure, I have received a motion from 39 individual Members and from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance calling for Mr Hughes Martin' s recommendation on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy concerning the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States and the Arab Republic of Egypt to be deferred until the January 2002 part-session whilst retaining oral questions to the Council and to the Commission on this matter on the order of business for today.
Mr President, we realise that the situation in Egypt is one of the best, or least bad in that area.
We are not opposing the association agreement; we are just calling for its adoption to be deferred because association agreements, in particular, contain a very tough human rights clause.
Thus far, the Commission and the Council have never, and I repeat, never, attempted to use cooperation or association agreements to secure respect for human rights.
Ironically, we are being called upon to vote at the precise moment when Egypt is showing a particularly worrying tendency to persecute homosexuals - with a trial in which 26 people were condemned to up to 5 years of solitary confinement - and Catholics.
Well then, at this specific time, I do not feel that taking a few extra weeks to endorse, to ratify these association agreements in order to obtain sufficient guarantees from the Council and the Commission, as well as from the Egyptian authorities, would constitute an act of hostility towards Egypt. Quite the contrary, I feel that it would be an act of confidence in their, and our, ability to make human rights an essential, key factor in foreign and cooperation policy.
Mr President, often in this House, we adopt many resolutions and we say many fine words.
Now is a unique opportunity to influence the rights of those in Egypt whose human rights are diminished.
We need to influence and improve the way Egypt operates in this field.
We need to defer to give Egypt, a friend of the EU, time for reflection.
Resolutions and words, albeit well-intentioned, seem to achieve little.
Here is an opportunity for action.
September 11 should have taught us that we must apply the same principles to our friends, as to our enemies.
Egypt is a friend.
We must give Egypt the time to reflect, because if we diminish the rights of individuals living in those countries, ultimately, we diminish our own human rights.
I urge the House to support the motion.
Mr President, the demand for an adjournment of this debate and vote on the draft association agreement with Egypt is completely unrealistic, not to say bizarre. It shows a complete lack of understanding of the agreement and of Egypt, a great country and a friend of Europe.
The draft agreement contains 92 articles concerning not only economic and social issues, but also the political dialogue which is important for achieving progress and peace.
Negotiations leading up to the agreement have taken over seven years and have been conducted in difficult circumstances.
Those who are calling for an adjournment have clearly not thought about the consequences, especially given the current state of world affairs.
Need I remind you that, unlike certain other Arab countries, Egypt has never been a breeding ground for terrorists?
On the contrary, Egypt has paid dearly for terrorism.
It would be irresponsible not to adopt this agreement.
It is unrealistic to expect Egypt to copy our models exactly.
It is unrealistic to expect to be able to impose our law.
It is unrealistic not to take account of the culture, identity and sovereignty of Egypt.
The Member States and we, ourselves, must ratify this agreement.
We owe it to the European Union because this agreement will be an essential factor in the necessary relaunch of the Barcelona process.
We owe it also to Egypt, a great country and a friend of Europe, acknowledged for its role in working for peace in the Middle East.
We shall now proceed to the vote on the request to defer the debate.
(Parliament rejected the request)
Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased and honoured to have been appointed rapporteur for the association agreement between the European Union, the Member States and the Arab Republic of Egypt, given the importance of this agreement for both the European Union and Egypt.
I believe it is a balanced agreement which treats both parties in an equitable way.
The Arab Republic of Egypt is the largest Arab country in terms of population: it has over 66 million inhabitants.
It occupies a pivotal position in terms of geopolitical affairs and plays a leading role.
Egypt was the first Arab country to establish diplomatic relations with Israel.
Since that time, it has continued to have a moderating influence in the region.
Relations between the European Union and Egypt go back a long way. The first cooperation agreement was signed in 1972.
We must remember that the European Union is Egypt' s most important trading partner.
Egypt also receives significant funds from cooperation with the European Union: it received EUR 686 million through the MEDA I programme between 1996 and 1999. The report we are discussing today has been called a new generation report.
Its fundamental objective is to help achieve peace and security in the region. It also aims to provide an impetus for the development of commercial and economic relations between Egypt and the European Union, and between Egypt and its Mediterranean partners.
The draft agreement is based on respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights. The main objectives of the agreement are as follows.
Firstly, the establishment of an area of free trade between Egypt and the European Union. This will entail the abolition of customs tariffs on industrial products within a period of 12 to 15 years after the agreement enters into force.
Secondly, regional cooperation, including the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean area of free trade.
Thirdly, it establishes the basis for economic and financial cooperation in many areas, including the fight against terrorism. Lastly, an in-depth dialogue on social issues and cooperation as regards the prevention and control of illegal immigration.
I am delighted that this proposal has received the unanimous support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. This shows the interest the report has generated.
It has also allowed people to express their concerns and fears; some of these are well founded, others less so.
I would like to outline two of the concerns put forward.
Firstly, there is the problem of the Coptic minority.
Coptic Christians represent more than 10% of the population.
It appears that, while they are not systematically persecuted, they do not have the same rights and responsibilities as their fellow Muslim citizens.
It is also clear that extremists are to blame for some of the problems as they do everything they can to exacerbate tension between the two religious groups.
However, some progress has been made, as confirmed by the Coptic religious leaders. One example is the recent construction of new monasteries and churches, despite the red tape involved.
Secondly, certain individuals and groups have been brought before the courts. This has been highly publicised in Egypt and elsewhere.
We need to look beyond the initial verdicts.
The local court judges are sometimes influenced by fundamentalist teaching and hand down harsh sentences.
But, in some instances, higher courts overturn these initial verdicts and act more leniently, in accordance with democratic principles.
I am aware that a lot of work still remains to be done on the issues of fairness and justice, but clearly some progress has been made.
The leaders from the opposition and from NGOs, who I have met with in the country, confirm this.
The report has raised a number of more general concerns.
I share some of these, but I must caution those who very willingly step forward to preach to us and to give eulogies on human rights. They should be aware of the need to put their own house in order.
It is all too easy for the Egyptians to remind us of our own deficiencies, and they are right to do this. We are open to criticism for having been so lax on a number of issues, particularly as regards the fight against terrorism.
We have been reminded that our Member States provide terrorists and murderers, including some Egyptians, with a safe haven where they can live and act with impunity.
We must be on our guard.
Many Egyptians, including some in important positions, do not wish this agreement to be ratified.
They insist that the agreement strongly favours the European Union, especially as regards economic issues, and that it will allow random intrusions into the internal affairs of the State.
The recent letter from the People' s Assembly on this matter is inopportune but significant.
Given these circumstances, I hope that the great majority of Parliament will vote in favour of ratifying this agreement. It is to be hoped that the agreement will strengthen the role of the European Union in this region and will contribute towards achieving peace.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 14 July this year, along with some of my colleagues from the Group of the Europe People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I met the Egyptian Foreign Minister and representatives of the People' s Assembly of the Arab Republic of Egypt in Cairo.
This meeting was arranged following the completion of our fact-finding mission, which took us from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and Ramallah. Our mission enabled us to gain a much better understanding of the gravity of the situation.
It also made us more aware of the way in which the European Union is acting as a mediator in the region, thanks to the unstinting efforts of Ambassador Moratinos and his team. The importance of his work cannot be stressed highly enough.
We decided to hold this meeting because we appreciate the importance of the role Egypt has played in this part of the Middle East. We recall the courageous decisions taken by President Sadat and how he paid for them with his life.
At present, President Moubarak is acting with equal courage and risking his own life. Both men have worked steadfastly in helping to get the peace process moving.
Sadly, the latter is, today, at a standstill. We were struck by the pertinence of how our Egyptian friends assessed the situation; and this came home to me at the time of the dreadful events of 11 September.
Three weeks ago, I was given the honour of chairing the committee drafting the final declaration of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum. This was an extraordinary session convened by the President of the European Parliament in order to tackle the new crisis and to reinvigorate the Barcelona process.
It was thanks to the contribution of the Egyptian representative, amongst others, that this forum was able to adopt a statement. One of the things this document calls for is for the relaunch of the dialogue between the peoples living on both shores of the Mediterranean on our different cultures and religions.
This would help us to gain a better understanding of each other. The dialogue should not be pursued merely in a spirit of tolerance.
We tolerate only those things we find difficult to accept. Rather, it should take place in an atmosphere of genuine mutual respect in which we accept and benefit from our differences.
This is why I particularly welcome the excellent report by Mr Hughes Martin.
It is indeed in the interest of both the European Union and of Egypt to formalise their association by signing the agreement the Council has put to us.
It would be completely irresponsible for the European Parliament to delay the signing in any way.
I would like those Members who are overzealous in defending human rights to consider the impression the West, in general, and the European Union, in particular, give when they preach, sometimes opportunely and sometimes inopportunely, to their partner Arab and African countries.
They should realise that they sometimes have just as much to learn about the issue as they have to teach.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe the rapporteur has done a very good piece of work with this report and we can be pleased that after so many years of negotiations Egypt has at last agreed with us to sign this report.
A short time ago we voted for a deferral of this report and I think anyone who really wants to address the question of human rights in Egypt must vote in favour of this report.
This report gives us, the European Union, the ability to take up this matter because we have this human rights clause in Article 2.
Anyone who is really interested in peace in the Middle East must support this report in any case because it strengthens a country that has been fighting for peace in the Middle East for years.
I cannot understand why honourable Members who voted unanimously in favour of this report a week ago in committee now have reservations.
Nothing in Egypt has changed, I do not know where anything has changed that would make anybody take a different stance now than the one we took in committee.
I would like to raise one final point, that is the letter that the Speaker of the Egyptian Parliament has written to us.
I would like to say that it is unusual to try to influence a decision in this way, an absolutely independent decision of a parliament, and for this reason I shall tomorrow be tabling an oral amendment on behalf of my group, as already arranged with the rapporteur.
Mr President, Commissioner, clearly, the signature of any agreement constitutes an important milestone in the Barcelona process.
This is particularly so if the agreement is being signed with Egypt, which is such an important country. We know and believe it can play a leading role in North-South and South-South dialogue, and be in the forefront of economic and commercial development.
As General Morillon stated, we also believe that Egypt is ready to take the lead in all issues relating to cultural dialogue and civil society, not just in economic and financial matters, and that it is in a position to do so.
Furthermore, Egypt' s key role as a mediator in the Arab-Israeli conflict is patently obvious.
For all these reasons, substantiated cases of infringement of fundamental human rights and freedoms, such as those referred to today, give cause for particular concern. Article 2 cannot therefore be simply a political clause.
It has to have tangible value.
It is important for those countries to progress along the road to democracy. We believe the Egyptian government should take this fully into account.
I should like to make one point clear to Mr Sakellariou. Nobody has raised the possibility of voting against this report.
The previous vote was not for or against this report. As I see it, sounding a note of caution simply amounts to giving Egypt the importance due to it as a country.
It does not mean penalising it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the proposed signing of an association agreement between the European Union and Egypt, which will help to strengthen the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
The European Union attaches great importance to the chapter on fundamental rights and freedoms.
We should only sign this agreement on condition that these rights will be respected strictly.
Since 1981, Egypt has been subject to an emergency law granting wide powers to the authorities, to the detriment of human rights and democratic freedoms.
Today, these so-called freedoms are regulated and are subject to strict control by the authorities.
The valuable work undertaken by NGOs has alerted us to this matter.
We call upon the government of Egypt to repeal this emergency law, so men and women can enjoy all their rights. This would mean that people would not be criminalised on the grounds of their sexual orientation, their religion or their opinion.
We will not remain silent on the decision to take legal action against homosexuals, which constitutes a violation of human rights which goes completely against the values we hold dear.
We must not interfere, we must not claim that our values are superior, we must not preach but we must denounce and condemn.
Human rights are universal and transcend all borders.
Mr President, the fact that the European Community and its Member States are entering into an association agreement with Egypt evokes very mixed feelings in me.
My reservations mainly revolve around the unequal and unsafe social position which Egyptian Christians find themselves in.
The oral question to the Commission underlines this anxiety.
How does it intend to persuade the Egyptian authorities to improve the situation of the Coptic community?
Bear in mind that at least six million Egyptian citizens are involved.
It is therefore extremely regrettable that precisely the violation of their fundamental constitutional rights is not explicitly mentioned in the motion for a resolution.
By way of illustration, I should like to quote three serious instances of abuse with which Egyptian Christians are weighed down: not only do the Egyptian authorities veto the construction of new churches, they also take part in the criminal persecution of Muslims who want to convert to Christianity.
The latter is done under the veiled indictment of subversive activities.
Thirdly, there is legal uncertainty among the Christian community in Upper Egypt: it is exposed to downright religious persecution by Muslim extremists.
Such a vacuum in authority is not acceptable and cannot be solved by combining the arrest of Islamists with the random rounding up of a number of indigenous Christians.
I would therefore urge the Commission, the Council and the Member State governments to put these abuses on the agenda during the consultation with the Egyptian authorities.
They are duty-bound to do this on account of the content of this association agreement.
The positive element, namely that since 11 September, the Coptic churches have been having talks with the Egyptian authority, reinforces this essential provision.
Mr President, I, too, want to make it clear to the rapporteur that, here, nobody has proposed rejecting the association agreement with Egypt.
We are not trying to play the high-handed human rights idealists who are against realpolitik and interests.
Quite the opposite, rapporteur: I feel that we are just a little more realistic in our approach.
Given that seven years have already passed, as you have said, deciding to wait maybe another month or two to give ourselves the time to find a response to specific issues before implementing an agreement which, I am glad to say, is irreversible on many points, is, I feel, being realistic.
Attempting to pursue the issue of human rights with empty, worthless declarations of which we have made thousands in the past and will make thousands more in the future, depriving ourselves of a practical pressure lever at precisely the moment when we could be getting down to the nitty-gritty is, I feel, being unrealistic.
What we requested is that, for once, the European Commission and the European Union should view the issue of human rights as something which needs to be given practical expression in relationships where we have bargaining power with other countries too.
We know that there is a human rights clause, we know that this clause could, theoretically, encourage respect for human rights in Egypt and maybe even increase comprehension of a country such as Egypt in Europe.
The problem is that the upholding of human rights, the possibility of making a direct impact, of putting tangible pressure on the human rights situation, is a policy which is not part of the European Commission' s strategy. It is a policy which has no practical expression whatsoever.
We have endeavoured, in our proposal, to be just that little bit more realistic than you. You do not have time to wait?
No problem. I am all for the association agreements, I am all for free trade and I am all for Egypt!
However, it will not be easy to further the cause of human rights.
Mr President, first of all, should we hurry to forge closer bonds with Egypt, assuming that unanswered questions and miscarriages of justice will fade away and resolve themselves, before we have stopped and thoroughly examined what exactly is at the heart of the State i.e. the way it treats its citizens: the cases of fundamental human rights abuse, the 52 men put on trial for their homosexuality, for Egypt wanting "to protect order and its national values", the conviction of 23 of these men, the repression of Christians by Islamic extremists which is allowed to go unpunished, the case of Dr Saad El-din Ibrahim and other intellectuals imprisoned for having used funds that we, the European Union, gave them.
Moreover, correspondence with the President of the People's Assembly of Egypt and the Ambassador in Brussels only seemed to underline Egypt's complacency on this matter and eagerness to fudge and gloss over the issues.
Does Parliament condone violations of the right to a fair trial, freedom of expression, and freedom of association whether it be social, political, religious or sexual?
For that is what we are saying if we gloss over the human rights issue.
We must send out an unequivocal message that such blatant abuses of fundamental human rights cannot, must not, and will not be tolerated by the European Community.
As this is a joint debate I propose to deal with both the report and the oral question together and I should like to say, at the outset, that we very much appreciate Egypt's position as a key regional power.
Egypt, as a number of speakers have said, plays a significant role in supporting the Middle East peace process and the point that the honourable and gallant gentleman General Morillon made about the sacrifices that some have made in supporting that peace process is entirely correct.
We are also delighted that Egypt supports a more substantial involvement by the European Union in the Middle East peace process.
It is also very active in other regional issues, notably in promoting a resolution of the civil war in the Sudan, in promoting regional free trade through initiatives like the Agadir process which also involves, of course, Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan and COMESA.
We are also grateful for what Egypt does in helping to consolidate the support of the Arab world for the campaign against international terrorism.
I can only say I am relieved at the way the vote turned out a few moments ago given that we pressed Egypt so hard to conclude the negotiations on the association agreement.
I can remember standing in this Chamber and being asked what I was doing to press the Egyptians to come to an early agreement for the negotiations.
So it has been a rather unusual experience for me today to find a deferral being urged.
The association agreement was a long time in negotiation but its signature marked an important new stage in Europe's relations with Egypt.
The 1978 Cooperation Agreement served its purpose very well but the European Union and Egypt have changed beyond recognition and a new agreement was necessary to underpin what has become an altogether more mature relationship.
The Agreement responds to the enormous interests, both economic and political, both bilateral and regional, that the European Union and Egypt have in common and the result of the negotiations is good for both sides.
It is good for Egypt because it will help the Egyptian economy to face the challenge of globalisation more successfully and more competitively and to carry through reforms within the context of a privileged economic and political relationship with us.
It is good for the European Union because it will give a new depth and quality to our relationship with this key political and economic partner and, in addition, the agreement is good for the Barcelona process.
With this agreement the infrastructure of association agreements which underpins it is now largely in place and I hope that we will make good progress shortly with Algeria, the Lebanon and Syria.
There is now a critical mass of agreements to allow other Barcelona initiatives to flourish.
Let me just refer again to the free trade area which is proposed between the countries which signed that agreement in Agadir.
We must now look beyond the negotiation of the agreement into the need for prompt ratification and adequate implementation and I want to underline the point about ratification.
It is more than a shame that the agreement with Jordan, for example, has still not been ratified by all the Member States and we need to encourage people to get on with the ratification of these agreements rather more rapidly.
We obviously welcome the excellent report which has been drafted by the honourable gentleman Mr Martin.
It is a very professional piece of work and we are grateful for that and the support for the rapid ratification of the agreement by Parliament.
It is in everyone's interest that all the provisions of the agreement enter into force very quickly and I hope that the ratification process in this case proceeds expeditiously.
This will be an important procedural step but also a very positive and encouraging signal to the Egyptian and Member State parliaments.
Certainly, the procedural delays in the ratification process by some Member States are often incomprehensible to our Mediterranean partners.
I have noted the concern of certain parliamentarians that our agreements with Mediterranean partners give insufficient stress to interparliamentary relations.
Existing practice indicates that Parliament will not hesitate to develop increasing close contacts with its Egyptian counterpart but, in addition, let me stress that interparliamentary relations are well covered in the relevant texts.
I have also noticed the European Parliament's concern, which I understand, at the state of civil, religious and political rights in Egypt.
I can assure Members that I have not hesitated to discuss these matters regularly with my Egyptian counterparts.
All aspects of the European Union's relationship with Egypt, including the respect for human rights, are continuously monitored by the Commission which is vigilant on human rights issues irrespective of the agreement.
The provisions of the new agreement provide both sides with important safeguards and a valuable additional forum.
When the agreement comes into force we will be able to raise, and hopefully resolve, any major issue at the appropriate association council or committee.
I just make the point - very gently to honourable ladies and gentlemen who might not agree with this point and who came in a flurry of enthusiasm earlier to vote against going ahead with the ratification of this agreement - that this agreement gives us a much better forum for discussing with the Egyptians exactly the issues which they raised.
Individual cases including alleged restrictions on the Coptic community are taken up from time to time by the Commission.
We collaborate closely with Member States in taking positions on these issues and I hope that Parliament will have noted that we never hesitate to make our views known to the Egyptian authorities.
I note that, as far as the inordinately light sentences on those accused of instigating murderous riots against Christians in Upper Egypt were concerned, the Court of Appeal in Egypt has ordered a retrial.
Most recently, the Commission delegation has explained the contractual basis of grants to non-governmental organisations in the context of the Saad Ibrahim appeal which I have discussed in the past with my Egyptian counterparts.
We have joined with Member States in expressing our concern to the Egyptian authorities at the outcome of the recent trial of homosexuals and I understand the concerns that have been expressed by honourable Members about their case.
But we should also note encouraging developments, the new social legislation on the rights of women, the supervision of elections by the courts and the important rulings by courts on the constitutionality of contentious legislation.
The need for good and fluid European relations with Egypt can seldom have been more important.
In the last few weeks everybody has been talking about the vital importance of trying to demonstrate to the Arab and Islamic world that the campaign against terrorism is not the West setting Europe and the United States against the world of Islam.
Everybody sensible has made the point that it is, at the least, unwise for us to lecture the Islamic world as though we had a monopoly of virtue.
Everybody has talked about the importance of deepening the dialogue with the Islamic world.
We have an agreement which gives us the chance of putting in place a foundation stone for our relations with the countries around the Mediterranean.
The idea that you could have a serious policy on the Mediterranean without having an agreement with Egypt is "for the birds", as the Americans say.
We obviously have to take up human rights...
(Interruption by Mr Cashman)
I respect the honourable Member but think he will do me the credit of knowing that I do not have to take lectures on human rights from anybody.
We want to pursue our dialogue on human rights with Egypt and other countries in the Barcelona process but it would be bizarre to argue that Europe should have a serious constructive policy in the Mediterranean and that it should have a deep and profound dialogue with Islamic countries and at the same time reject an association agreement with Egypt.
So I hope that Parliament will continue to take its cue from the excellent report widely commended by all Members prepared by Mr Martin.
I hope that Parliament will continue to be vigilant about civil, political and social rights in Egypt but will also continue to work hard for a stronger relationship between the European Union and the people in government in Egypt.
Mr President, I would just like to point out to Commissioner Patten that we already have an association agreement with an Arab country. We have had one with Tunisia for two years now and things are going from bad to worse!
Need I say more?
That was not on a point of order!
I would like to inform Commissioner Patten that it was not the intention of the House this evening to reject the association agreement but to defer it.
As to lectures in human rights, we all - regardless of our record - need to be lectured on human rights.
The debate is closed.
In accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received a motion for a resolution.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Aid for reconstruction
The next item is the joint debate on the following four reports:
A5-0386/2001 by Mr Lagendijk on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2666/2000 on assistance for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1628/96 and amending Regulations (EEC) No 3906/89 and (EEC) No 1360/90 and Decisions 97/256/EEC and 1999/311/EC, and Council Regulation (EC) No 2667/2000 on the European Agency for Reconstruction [COM(2001) 551 - C5-0477/2001 - 2001/0223(CNS)];
A5-0385/2001 by Mr Färm on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the proposal and on the amended proposal for a Council decision amending Council Decision 1999/733/EC providing supplementary macro-financial assistance to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [COM(2001) 519 - C5-0486/2001 + COM(2001) 613 - 2001/0213(CNS)];
A5-0411/2001 by Mr Färm on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the proposal for a Council decision on amending Council Decision 1999/325/EC providing macro-financial assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina [COM(2001) 610 - C5-0558/2001 - 2001/0250(CNS)];
A5-0410/2001 by Mr Färm on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the proposal for a Council decision on amending Decision 2001/549/EC of 16 July 2001 providing macro-financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [COM(2001) 618 - C5-0559/2001 - 2001/0258(CNS)].
Mr President, the answer to the question of whether we can support the Commission proposal to extend the activities of the European Agency for Reconstruction to include Macedonia is, in fact, quite simple.
When one or two months ago the Commission presented its proposal for the first time, there was some doubt.
This doubt had nothing to do with the appreciation of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy for the European Agency for Reconstruction. Indeed, this Agency has had very positive feedback right from the outset.
This positive assessment was confirmed recently by a very complimentary remark by the Court of Auditors about the prompt and effective way in which the Agency has carried out its work to date.
Our initial doubts were, therefore, quite unrelated to the Agency, but stemmed from the fact that the Commission itself appeared unsure as to which direction to take with regard to assistance in the Balkans.
Should it run its entire operation via the Agency for Reconstruction, first in Yugoslavia, subsequently in Macedonia and soon, perhaps, in Albania and Croatia, or should the Commission adhere to its original policy to devolve its powers to the delegations in the various countries?
We have, meanwhile, had the opportunity of talking to the Commissioner about this.
He promised that the Commission will soon, early next year, come up with an opinion about the strategy to be pursued with regard to assistance in the Balkans and that it will specify more clearly the role of the Agency for Reconstruction and the role which the devolved delegations must play.
We await this report with interest.
At the moment, and this removes the last lingering doubt, there is no alternative but to accord the Agency an important role if we want to grant assistance in Macedonia promptly and efficiently.
I believe that, as far as this aspect is concerned, we are in complete agreement with the Commission.
Why is it so important to grant aid in Macedonia so quickly now and to do this, therefore, via the Agency?
I have pointed out the great significance of the developments in Macedonia for the European Union many times, both earlier in this debate and at other occasions, notably after 11 September.
Macedonia' s importance is many times greater than that of a relatively small country in the Balkans.
Indeed, it is the first time that the European Union has managed, in talking with one voice, to do a reasonable job in the Balkans, in Macedonia, something which we would have liked to have seen a long time ago.
It is the greatest success story of European foreign policy so far.
Talk with one voice and do what you do best: that is, after all, what the Commission and the European Union have been doing to date in Macedonia.
There have been talks and consultations, compromises have been reached, financial aid pledged and limited military aid promised.
In my view, that is the best that the European Union has to offer at the moment, and it is important for this effort, namely having prevented a civil war from breaking out a few months ago, to be followed up by sufficient financial aid and sufficient reconstruction equipment.
Hence, a positive opinion, from Parliament too, about involving the Agency.
If the situation changes for the worse in Macedonia, then I fear that that will rub off in the Balkans as a whole.
Hence, once again, my urgent plea for involving the Agency, but also for mapping out a sound strategy.
It is a well-known fact - fellow MEPs, Swoboda and Pack, and the Commissioner, himself, have visited the region many times - that tension in Macedonia is currently very high.
Under pressure from the European Parliament, the European Union and many international bodies, the Macedonian Parliament has, at long last, ratified the constitution.
That has led, and is still leading, to major tension.
Europe can do a great deal to clear that tension, and one of the ways is to translate words into deeds swiftly.
That is where the Agency comes in.
In short, prompt aid in Macedonia is needed, both materially and politically.
At the moment, we need the Agency there for reconstruction.
I would urge the Commission to clarify its strategy in the Balkans soon, and also to specify the role which the Agency has to play and the role which other sections of the Commission will need to play in future.


Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, I have probably set some kind of record here today, for I have been given a whole 15 minutes in which to speak, because I am rapporteur for three different, but quite similar, matters.
Perhaps I shall not need all this time.
It now finally looks as if developments in the Balkans are heading in the right direction and in a more stable way.
We finally have something resembling peace, albeit under armed supervision, with continued violence between ethnic groups and still a long way to go before there is peaceful co-existence.
It has been possible to successfully implement the disarmament of the armed groups in Macedonia, especially following important efforts by the EU.
We can therefore feel a certain optimism, even though history has all too often shown us that peace is fragile, especially in the Western Balkans.
Democracy, too, is making progress.
Last autumn, the Milosevic dictatorship collapsed through the Yugoslav people' s decisive action.
In Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, albeit with a number of problems in the last case, the democratic powers have made progress.
Last week' s election in Kosovo was conducted impeccably.
It felt like a privilege to be present at this historic event as an observer from the European Parliament.
A lot remains to be done, however.
There is a great need for purely physical reconstruction, but also for the development of the economy and infrastructure that were allowed to fall into decay during the nineties.
The most important thing of all is, perhaps, to bring about a genuine process of reconciliation through which the ethnic cleansing that has taken place in large parts of these countries can be got to grips with and solutions found to the serious outstanding problems involving refugees and displaced persons.
It is against this background that those of us in the Committee on Budgets have adopted three reports on temporarily extended, and also, in certain cases, increased, macro-financial assistance to Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Yugoslavia.
First of all, a word about Macedonia.
In November 1999, the Council decided to give Macedonia macro-financial assistance to the tune of EUR 80 million, part of it in the form of a loan, together with a contribution of up to EUR 30 million.
The decision was taken against the background of the war in Kosovo because this crisis gave rise to large costs in Macedonia, to which hundreds of thousands of people fled.
The aim has been to facilitate the implementation of structural reforms and to offset the consequences of the economic disruption caused by the Kosovo conflict.
The aid, of course, has conditions attached to it, mainly to the effect that the programme of economic and public administration reforms continue and that the agreements reached in Ohrid earlier this autumn be implemented.
As is well known, Macedonia has suffered as a result of this internal armed conflict. The conflict has, of course, also given rise to further problems and caused delays in making the assistance available.
It has only been possible to pay out a portion of it within the relevant time-frame.
That is why we now want to extend the legal basis for these forms of assistance.
That is something we have no problems with at all.
However, the Commission also proposes an increased financial contribution because there are beginning to be problems with Macedonia, where developments have otherwise been positive.
The problems have been exacerbated by the conflict.
That is why the Commission is now proposing increasing the contribution by EUR 18 million.
Against this political background, the Committee on Budgets believes the Commission' s proposal to be well considered.
Nonetheless, we have tabled a number of amendments in order to emphasise that this aid must be administered by the Commission, but in close consultation with both the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The background to this is that we see it as important to monitor not only the purely financial management of the assistance but also more political aspects with a view, for example, to making sure that no part of the assistance is used to equip the Macedonian army.
We would also emphasise that this type of aid, that is to say, contributions in combination with a long-term 'soft' loan, must be seen as exceptional and not allowed to constitute the norm for the future.
We then have the matter of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In May 1999, we decided to provide the assistance in question, comprising a loan of EUR 20 million and contributions of up to EUR 40 million.
This was, of course, also done to ease the economic situation and to support reconstruction in Bosnia and was obviously conditional upon the economy and the institutions of democracy continuing to be reformed.
We have had a number of problems with implementation, as a result of which assistance amounting to EUR 15 million remains to be paid out.
If we are to be able to make this available, we need, then, to extend the legal basis.
In this assessment, we must also take account of the fact that the elections held in Bosnia in November 2000 led to everything' s having taken an extremely long time, what with negotiations and the High Representative' s having had to intervene etc.
All this has delayed both the reforms and the legislative work and, thus, also delayed our making the aid available.
Economic growth has not been particularly good.
These forms of assistance are, therefore, genuinely needed, which is why those of us in the Committee on Budgets support the Commission' s proposal to modify this Council regulation so that we can extend the period up to the end of 2002.
When it comes to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, the same conditions must, nonetheless, apply in this case, as apply in the case of Macedonia.
Finally, something about the third matter, Yugoslavia.
We decided, as late as this year, to provide this macro-financial assistance of up to EUR 300 million in the form, in this case too, both of loans and of contributions.
The primary aim is, of course, to provide financial, social and political support for a stable Yugoslavia, but it is also, and this is something I want to emphasise, to promote Yugoslavia' s role as a stabilising factor throughout the region.
This year, it has emerged that the economic situation has, perhaps, been a little more strained than we had previously believed.
In particular, the privatisation process has taken longer, which has also led to the State budget' s losing income from the privatisation.
We also know it has been a tough process finding a solution to the problem of Yugoslavia' s relationship with the World Bank, the IMF etc.
If no money is provided, there is obviously a great risk of the economic situation' s deteriorating further.
We should, therefore, bear in mind that Yugoslavia now already has major debts amounting to more than 140 per cent of GDP.
That is why the Commission wants these new amounts, constituting an increase of EUR 45 million, to be in the form of contributions.
The Committee on Budgets says OK, but emphasises that these must, nonetheless, be seen as part of the EU' s multiannual programme and that they constitute exceptional assistance.
We have also arranged for the assistance to be paid out, provided that Yugoslavia continues to develop into a constitutional state and that the country continues to cooperate closely with the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
In all these three cases, we also believe that, in order to produce new resources during the current budget year, ordinary budget procedure must be followed.
This can only be done by means of a parallel process involving a transfer of funds from other budget items, something which requires a decision on the part of the budgetary authority.
Mr President, even before the last part-session in Strasbourg, the Commission wanted these matters to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.
I said at that time that, in my view, there were nonetheless two matters that needed to be cleared up first.
So that we, too, could see where the funds were to be taken from, we wanted, first of all, to see the Commission' s practical proposals for transferring funds in such a way as to produce the necessary EUR 45 or 18 million.
These proposals for transferring funds are now on the table and have been discussed in the Committee on Budgets.
Secondly, we wanted to sort out the conciliation with the Council concerning next year' s budget so as to be able to guarantee that this aid can be combined with a continued high level of other aid for the Western Balkans and for reconstruction etc.
We have now reached an agreement with the Council whereby this increased macro-financial assistance is to be seen as front loading for next year' s budget appropriation.
At the same time, we jointly accept the Commission' s preliminary draft budget for the Balkans, something which I also hope will be the result of the second budget reading during the next part-session in Strasbourg.
Against that background, we therefore support these three proposals.
Allow me, finally, just to say a few words about my and the Committee on Budgets' opinion on Mr Lagendijk' s report on the European Agency for Reconstruction.
I have, myself, on quite a few occasions had the opportunity to see the Agency' s work at first hand, and I view it as a model of efficiency, as does Mr Lagendijk too. Moreover, this view is also confirmed by the Court of Auditors' report.
I believe there are a number of specific reasons for this success.
Among these are the fact that, in accordance with Parliament' s demands, a more decentralised model for decision-making and the employment of EU aid has been implemented and that it has been possible to avoid the unwieldy and duplicated decision-making that we formerly had under the traditional committee system.
In spite of these excellent results from the Agency, the Committee on Budgets nonetheless wishes, in its amendments, to emphasise the importance of correct budget principles for distinguishing between administrative and operational expenditure with a view, for example, to our being able to make a proper, skilled assessment of the Agency' s activities.
Moreover, we wish to introduce a reference to Article 274 of the Treaty, in order to emphasise clearly that this is aid which the Commission and not, in the first place, the Member States have the responsibility for implementing.
Mr President, Mr Lagendijk has produced a very good report.
I would also like to thank Mr Färm sincerely and on behalf of my group, of which I seem to be the only representative here today, thank them both and in general terms agree with everything they have said.
I would also like to highlight a couple of things.
I think this rapid reaction facility, this way of getting money to crisis regions quickly, efficiently and without bureaucracy, really is a good instrument.
In Yugoslavia in particular, as the Commissioner has seen, they were grateful for this really quick and efficient assistance that was only possible because we had this instrument and did not have to use the usual longwinded procedure.
I also believe it really must be extended to Macedonia, because something simply must be done to help the difficult political processes.
The process is far from being completed.
Laws need to be implemented so that the Albanian citizens can see that they really have gained something from these constitutional changes.
The region' s Macedonian inhabitants must see that if they behave as is expected in democracies, they will also be rewarded with an improvement in their everyday lives.
We agree to everything, we also agree to the reservations Mr Färm has mentioned.
But I think the Commission knows all this very well and I am sure it respects it.
This brings me back again to the establishment of the agency in Macedonia.
In view of the pathetic results of implementation and of spending the money earmarked for this country since 1996, I am of the opinion that it is high time we sought to remedy the situation.
Of course, the Macedonian government lacked the will, and we who were down there know they were simply not in a position to do anything.
Whether they were unable or unwilling I would not like to say now, but there was a lack of will on the part of the government, and, in the end, the delegation on the spot was unable to give the government the help it needed.
The necessary technical assistance that the Commission should have given to this government was lacking.
I think it is therefore good that the Commissioner has now thought about measures that can be taken to speed things up.
It will be good for the agency, which is doing excellent work in Kosovo - I expect we shall see that in Belgrade next weekend.
We want it to be possible for them finally to do what the Macedonians are all waiting for and I have nothing against it being used.
However, Commissioner, my problem is that there is so much tinkering around going on now.
Now it is being done in Macedonia.
I do not know when you will be so effective again next time.
I would very much like to see a structure for this work in the region, and I would like to hear from you this evening whether you are willing or able to produce a scheme that will either, deconcentrate the delegations and enable them to do this work, or that you intend to deploy such agencies in the whole region.
I believe you owe us an answer on that this evening and I hope that this evening you will tell us how soon you, in the Commission, believe you can lay such a scheme before us.
On this condition, I am prepared to give you my unreserved best wishes for setting up this agency because we have all had excellent experience.
I do not want to criticise the delegation on the ground here.
The delegation on the ground was not able to do what we expected of it because it was not deconcentrated, whatever that means, and it could not give the technical assistance.
In that regard, I really am looking for a longer term scheme from you so that all the countries down there can feel they are being treated, more or less, equally and I think that is also important if we are to avoid creating rivalries between them.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs sincerely for their work.
Mr Lagendijk has already indicated that the situation in the Balkans today is quite different from that six months or a year ago, especially if we think of the elections in Kosovo and the settlement in Macedonia.
But that must not mislead us into saying everything has been done, the matter has been dealt with, we can just hang around and everything will turn out well.
I also think the step the Commission proposes is correct and justified.
But, Commissioner, we have already said, if it is really so and I believe it is, that there are serious differences between the work of the agency and the work of the delegations, and somewhere in between them, as a sort of happy medium, the decentralised delegations, then we must draw general conclusions from that, not because, in the one case, they are good people and, in the other, bad people.
It must surely also have something to do with the structure of the decision-making processes.
In this respect I am sure you will not be able to give us an answer today.
I want to ask you, however, one more thing, namely that, when restructuring the Commission' s work and policy in the Balkans; you will really use, to the full, the imagination that I am sure you, Commissioner, and many of your colleagues possess.
For my part, I believe that the agency, which is not only a reconstruction agency but already a development agency, ought to play a greater part over all.
I admit it can also be done jointly with delegations that are given additional tasks to do with decentralisation.
But I do think that early next year, at the start of next year, we ought to suggest what the Commission' s assistance, support and development structure for the Balkans should look like for the next ten years, for it will take, at least, ten years to achieve the take off we all want for the Balkans and that we need for peace and stability in Europe.
Mr President, I guess it would be a slight exaggeration to say that the Chamber was packed with knowledgeable friends of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, but those who are here are eminently qualified to address this subject because I think that the honourable Members who certainly know most about Macedonia and who are, in some respects, most knowledgeable about Southeast Europe as a whole are in this Chamber.
I am extremely grateful for the contribution which honourable Members have made to what has been a pretty successful development of Europe's strategy in the Balkans and I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Lagendijk, for his report.
Perhaps I can just re-establish the context in which we are having this debate.
Honourable Members know that Macedonia was the first country with which we negotiated a stabilisation and association agreement.
While we were negotiating that agreement, during each of my visits to FYROM - and I have visited Skopje probably more than any other capital city in the world in the last couple of years - we were regularly on the receiving end of grumbles about the lack of speed of our delivery of development assistance.
When the crisis came this year, we worked very hard and I pay a particular vote of gratitude to the work of my colleague, Javier Solana.
We worked extremely hard to try to get FYROM back on the rails.
We were delighted by the Lake Ohrid Agreement and said straightaway that we would do everything we could to help the implementation of the framework agreement in Lake Ohrid.
My concern, as I have explained to honourable Members, was that unless we made a special effort, we would not deliver that assistance quickly enough.
I would have very much liked to have gone through the process of deconcentration rather more rapidly to FYROM and delivered our assistance in a conventional way, but that was to run a risk.
The most certain way in which we could deliver the assistance was by extending the work of the Reconstruction Agency and that is why we are all here this evening.
I know that some honourable Members were understandably a little confused about our management strategy.
With the benefit of hindsight, with which we are all much wiser, it would perhaps have been sensible if I had consulted honourable Members earlier.
But I hope that we have managed to convince honourable Members that there was no intention on our part to downgrade our relationship with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
I saw President Trikovsky earlier this week.
He was en route to a prayer breakfast - I am afraid I was not - and I think that we have managed to convince him and the authorities in Skopje now that we are just trying to deliver assistance as rapidly as possible and we have already been delivering assistance in the sectors electricity and housing, etc.
It is understandable that honourable Members should think that there is some confusion in our management strategy for the whole region, But I do not feel that I am being inconsistent in arguing, on the one hand, that we have to work through Europe Aid, through deconcentration, which has now begun and which we must now push as rapidly as possible, while on the other hand, saying there may be odd occasions, particularly crises, which require different sort of arrangements.
We are considering for example, at the moment how to deal with the situation in Afghanistan - whether we should put a task force into Afghanistan in order to get quick-acting projects going as soon as possible.
So I do not think that it is inconsistent to press ahead with the reform of Europe Aid, while at the same time thinking that from time to time other arrangements are necessary.
Perhaps I can just remind honourable Members that we pledged EUR 30 million to the implementation of the framework agreement and that we have also been disbursing EUR 12.5 million under the rapid reaction mechanism.
We have committed about EUR 5 million through ECHO to humanitarian relief and we have got a regular CARDS programme of EUR 42 million for this year for FYROM.
All that work, except the ECHO dimension, will be put through the Agency over the next couple of months.
As far as we are concerned, the next event on the horizon will be the donors conference, which we will try to organise with the World Bank.
There are a number of conditions, as honourable Members will know.
We were first of all insisting on the implementation of the framework agreement on the passage of amendments to the Constitution through the Parliament in Skopje.
We also wanted a law on local government passed, because frankly if it is not, the United States is unlikely to come to a donors conference.
It is absolutely crucial, as my colleague Commissioner Solbes would assure you, if we are to provide macro-financial assistance at a donors conference, that there must be an agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
Macro-financial assistance is never given unless there is such an agreement.
President Trikovsky assured me this week that an agreement with the IMF is now on the cards and I think the relevant meeting in Washington is at the beginning of December.
I hope therefore that on the back of the passage of the legislation, which I have referred to, the constitutional amendments and the recommendation of an agreement to the board of the IMF, we can hold a successful donors conference.
If it is agreeable to all the parties, and to FYROM, we will do it before Christmas, but at the moment when it looks as though it is likely to be most successful.
What I do not want to do is to set a date for a second time and have to postpone it, because that would be calamitous.
I am very grateful to honourable Members for the fast delivery of their opinion on what we are proposing.
I am sorry that I cannot express my gratitude by accepting all the amendments which have been put down.
Characteristically, I am not able to do that.
Some of the amendments, for example the references to the provisional nature of what we are doing, are of no real legal value.
Others, I am advised, are not really suitable for inclusion in a legal decision.
I want however to respond slightly differently to two of the arguments which have been put and which you will understand.
First of all, I want to assure the Parliament that it would of course be consulted if there were any question of extending the Agency to other countries.
If we were to propose that, we would of course consult the Parliament.
Secondly, honourable Members, and this is a point that Mr Swoboda has made very eloquently, are concerned about the integrity of the management of what we are doing in Southeast Europe.
They are concerned about the coherence of what we are doing in Southeast Europe and understandably press us to set out our strategy for the management of community assistance for the Balkans.
I am happy to do that.
I just beg Parliament not to press me to do it by 31 January.
I will tell the Parliament why.
We have a good team of people working on the Balkans in the Commission.
They spend three-quarters of their time in meetings in the Council, in consultative task forces and in drafting reports; we are in the middle of drafting a report for the Council, which of course the Parliament will see, on the overall progress of the stabilisation and association process.
I do not want to make unreasonable demands on them, but I can assure Parliament that, as early next year as I can manage it, I will come to Parliament to try to set out the sort of strategy which I think honourable Members are entitled to ask for and which we should be pleased to give.
It is very important that Parliament should make sure from time to time that we actually know what we are doing.
I have been in this job for just over two years and what I am going to say does not suggest that all that has happened is because there has been a new Commission - I am not suggesting that at all.
But we have seen, first of all, a transformation in the region with the latest admirable events, as the honourable gentleman said: the elections in Kosovo and the developments in FYROM.
We know that every time we take a couple of steps forward, something will happen which pushes us back again, but I think that from Croatia to Serbia, to Macedonia and Albania, we are heading in the right direction.
We have a coherent strategy and we have made a remarkable amount of progress.
We have made that progress because we have worked together in a way which has extended stability to the region and underpinned those who are prepared bravely to argue and work for economic and political reform.
At the end of the stabilising and association process is the prospect of potential membership of the European Union.
That has been the most formidable element in bringing greater peace and stability to Southeast Europe.
We must make sure that the huge amount of political and financial investment that we have made in the last couple of years continues to pay off in steady progress and development.
That will of course be more likely if we are able to continue to work with Members of the Parliament.
Does the Commissioner agree that early next year is before the end of March?
Commissioner, I can also confirm that President Trikovsky was at the prayer breakfast, you were not.
But I also note that if things go on as they are, we will soon have more Commissioners than Members in Parliament.
That is also good to hear.
I suggested, President that he should pray for me.
I did it!
Mr President, as I take over from Commissioner Patten who spoke on various aspects of the political situation in the Balkans, I shall focus on the three programmes for macro-financial assistance.
As far as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is concerned, Mr Farm has made it quite clear that we are dealing with two distinct issues. These are firstly, increasing the amount of aid, and secondly, extending the period in which it is granted.
To date, we have disbursed EUR 30 million. This is partly due to delays in reaching agreement with the International Monetary Fund on the economic programme.
It is, indeed, the case that the conditions laid down pertaining to the constitutional changes now under way, and the much-needed support we are giving to economic stabilisation and the reform process mean that the International Monetary Fund' s cooperation is required. According to our information, the authorities in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will soon have in place an economic framework with associated follow-up.
This would act as a link with a support programme sponsored by the Fund.
The economic situation remains extremely precarious.
The International Monetary Fund has therefore informed us of the short-term financial requirements, and of the need for increased contributions by the various donors to cover the foreign financing deficit for the years 2001 and 2002.
This is the main reason for our decision to increase our additional contribution to Macedonia by EUR 18 million.
With regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are currently implementing aid.
EUR 60 million is committed, of which 40 million is grants and 20 million is loans.
The first two tranches have already been disbursed, one at the end of 1999 and the other at the end of 2000. Progress is being achieved in the areas of stabilisation and economic reform.
We have yet to disburse the final tranche of EUR 15 million. The conditions of disbursement are close to being met.
A Commission mission charged with assessing progress achieved is in Sarajevo this week. Speaking more generally, it is fair to say that the new government formed after the elections does, on occasion, take some time to carry through reform processes.
It is currently negotiating a new programme with the International Monetary Fund. Mr Farm also mentioned the need to extend the period agreed on, since that initially planned for implementation of contributions has expired.
From another perspective, the rapporteur also referred to the need to adjust financial or macro-financial aid to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
The current EUR 300 million, of which 225 is loans and 75 is grants is proving insufficient.
EUR 260 million has already been disbursed and the Commission is currently preparing to meet with the Yugoslav authorities again in the near future. We hope it will then be possible for the second tranche to be disbursed, providing the conditions are met.
According to information received from the International Monetary Fund, however, it is clear that additional external financing will be required to eliminate the further financing deficit of EUR 150 million. This is why we are proposing to increase the grant element by EUR 45 million to a maximum grant level of EUR 120 million.
I must commend Mr Farm on his devotion to this issue and on the speed and urgency with which he has dealt with it.
Thanks are also due to Mr Wynn, Chairman of the Committee on Budgets and to Mr Brok, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy for their support.
I should like to classify the amendments tabled into groups.
The amendments concerning political conditionality, the financial Regulation and the multiannual financial framework are acceptable, in principle. In some specific cases, however, they do present certain difficulties with regard to presentation or consistency.
To take the reference CARDS in connection with multiannual assistance as an example of consistency, we have stated quite clearly on a number of occasions in plenary that CARDS has nothing to do with macro-financial assistance.
The two elements are quite separate and I think the processes for using them correctly, in cases that might arise, should remain distinct.
We are not favourably inclined, either, to the comment that this assistance is exceptional and will not set a precedent for the future.
That is certainly the case.
Nonetheless, the same is true of all macro-financial assistance.
We do not, therefore, feel that it makes much sense to debate that today.
Neither do we believe that it makes much sense to include elements involving additional delays in the whole process of making this assistance available.
In this connection, whilst keeping Parliament duly informed, it would be wise to give more thought to the role of the Assistance Committee, which is quite a different body.
More detailed information on all these issues can be made available later. I simply wished to give some indication as to our initial position.
Thank you, Commissioner Solbes.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria
The next item is the proposal for a European Parliament and Council resolution on the contribution to the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria [COM(2001) 612 - C5-0520/2001 - 2001/0251(COD)].
Thank you, Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
I take the floor to defend the European Community' s contribution to the fight against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, a bittersweet task.
I am pleased that we have contrived to approve a significant financial contribution by the Union to the creation of a Global Fund as suggested by the United Nations' Secretary-General. The aim is to fight against the three most common contagious diseases in the world.
They affect the least developed countries who find themselves trapped in a vicious circle of poverty and disease. The higher the level of poverty, the greater the risk of contagious diseases.
In turn, a higher level of disease aggravates the degree of poverty.
It is pleasing, too, that we have achieved this in record time, through the codecision procedure, with urgency and at first reading. A number of amendments were tabled and negotiated with the Council.
In our view, these improved the text of the original proposal.
On the other hand, I have to say how much we regret that the Council and, especially, the Commission, have put us in such a difficult position. They have presented us with a text which, as originally drafted, bypassed Parliament and denied us the right to exercise our responsibilities as a budgetary authority.
No account was taken of Parliament' s repeated statements on the need for much more energetic action in the context of a global strategy to fight against poverty, and, in particular, against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. I refer, in particular, to the report by Bashir Khanbhai, who is with us today.
A lot of time and energy went into it. It was approved by a resolution in plenary on 4 October this year, yet the initial document put before us did not even refer to it.
In their common declaration last May, the Council and the Commission welcomed the United Nations Secretary-General' s proposal to set up this Global Fund. Back in July, the Commission announced its intention to commit EUR 120 million to finance it.
It was only last month, however, that Parliament received the documentation enabling it to begin its work. Furthermore, the documentation was incomplete and did not allow us to work properly.
It is only fair to note that, in the last fortnight, Parliament and the Council have demonstrated more of the willingness and flexibility required to reach agreement on the amendments we wished to introduce. I trust the latter will be adopted tomorrow morning.
In our view, the additional nature of the contribution to the Fund is a key issue.
As stated in our Amendment No 2, the first EUR 60 million from the 2001 budget should be added to existing resources and not withdrawn from other budget lines already earmarked for development programmes. As stated in Amendment No 3, the EUR 60 million in question should not pre-empt or impose conditions on future annual contributions.
This is clearly stated in our Amendment No 4. I shall probably be tabling an oral amendment on this tomorrow, Commissioner, prior to the vote.
In our view too, given the very nature of these diseases it is crucial to maintain the Union' s contribution to the fund over a period of time.
The fight against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria must continue to be pursued energetically in the years to come. If it is not, it will be unsuccessful and the EUR 60 million we are contributing will be to no avail.
Parliament cannot abrogate its responsibilities as a budgetary authority.
In Amendment No 6, we therefore request the Commission to make all the necessary information available to Parliament.
As stated in Amendment No 7, the last of our amendments, we shall then be in a position to guarantee the suitability, transparency, sound management and working practices of the Global Fund. A report will duly be prepared, and should be included in future annual reports on contributions to external aid that the Community will be required to present.
At the G8 Summit held in July 2000 in Okinawa, the rich industrialised G8 countries pledged substantial funds to fight communicable diseases and help the sick in poor countries.
In September last year the Commission held a conference on the subject in Brussels but no action followed.
Four million of the poorest people died in one year.
In July 2001 another meeting took place in Genoa and Mr Prodi announced to the world's media a donation of EUR 120 million.
My report, unanimously approved on 4 October this year has been sitting on the shelf collecting dust.
The Council adopted a proposal for a legal basis for the fund to be implemented but so far not one euro has been given, and a further 2 million people have died.
When terrorist bombs cause death the victims attract money very fast but the 3-4 million people who die from diseases are not in our minds.
Why does it take the Commission so long to present a plan for implementation when they know that every day 10 000 people are dying?
We promise with pride but we fail to deliver.
Do these people not matter to us?
The Commissioners have gone.
There is no interest.
Look at the audience in this Chamber, hardly anyone is here.
That shows what priority the European Union gives to such an important project.
This is not FYROM or Macedonia.
This is AIDS affecting the poorest people in the world and it is about time that the EU contribution is not just EUR 20 per person dying, not just 1% of what is required, but that it is EUR 6 billion per annum.
We have often debated these problems in the past, but quite rightly do so again tonight: 36.1 million people are living with HIV/AIDS in this world, tuberculosis is making a tragic comeback, 300 million people suffer the debilitating and painful effects of malaria.
If anything needed a visionary, innovative and international response, it is the prevalence of these communicable diseases.
We want to support, in principle, this global fund to fight communicable diseases.
We want to see it concentrate on prevention as well as treatment of all three diseases.
We want an innovative and workable governance framework. We want a true international partnership so it is not just seen as donor business as usual.
We want funding mechanisms that fast-track funds so that we can maintain the political commitment and mobilise further resources.
These are difficult issues and I sympathise with the Commission for the delays that have been forced on it in bringing forward this request for a legal base.
But it should reflect also on why the second reading proposals on our own support through the poverty diseases line were cut back from Parliament's demands, and why President Prodi announced EUR 60 million of support from the global health fund from the ACP countries, which it was not his right to do and, as we heard in this Chamber from their President-in-Office they oppose.
We must be concerned that this money actually adds to the global efforts and does not simply go into the pockets of the pharmaceutical companies.
The amendments that we have constructively negotiated with the Commission and Council improve this proposal: the recognition that we need additional money, the fact that this is simply a first payment and the request to the Commission both to bring forward a legal base for future contributions and to provide a report so that some of these information issues can be dealt with.
I ask Commissioner Nielson if he can give us a time-scale as to when that might be brought forward during the course of next year so we can deal with it properly in the budget process.
Mr President, we have long been calling for an increase in funds for AIDS given the appalling situation.
The European Parliament has made its stance on this issue clear in voting for the Khanbhai report.
We were naturally very encouraged by the decision to release a further EUR 120 million.
However, the proposal put before us today, after some prevarication, only amounts to EUR 60 million.
Furthermore, this will come from the existing budget.
This is not extra money. These funds are not ongoing.
We also wish to question the allocation of this money to a single international fund.
What is the aim of this fund?
Is it only for prevention?
Or will it also provide access to treatment for people living in the countries of the South?
Will it provide health care infrastructures and medicines?
These are the questions we must ask.
How will this fund be managed?
How will those that need this money, namely the countries of the South, be involved in these decisions? It is not simply up to the donor countries.
I think that we must ask ourselves all these questions because people are dying everyday, but we have money and it is up to us to help them.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are faced with an unprecedented human catastrophe.
According to the WHO report published today, 40 million people have so far become HIV positive and 3 million will die before the end of this year. It is clear that the majority of the people affected by this disease live in Sub-Saharan Africa.
AIDS is not just a crisis in terms of human health; it also constitutes an ecological and economic disaster.
The WHO predicts that the least developed countries will lose a fifth of their GNP between now and 2010 because of the disease.
In countries like Zambia, one million children will die. The funds announced may appear to be substantial, but as my fellow Member said a moment ago, some questions remain to be answered.
Who will manage these funds? Will the money really reach the people in the greatest need, for whom it was intended?
As we are all aware, work to combat these diseases must involve the provision of infrastructures such as dispensaries, social support structures and doctors.
This cannot be done when we have diktats from the IMF and the World Bank which do not allow us to employ civil servants and doctors.
Once again Mr President, I would like to call for the cancellation of Third World debt and for this money to be allocated to education, prevention and health. This is the right way to combat AIDS in the long term.
I would like to finish by saying that we can no longer tolerate the arrogant attitude the pharmaceutical industry adopted last year in relation to certain countries. This is totally unacceptable.
